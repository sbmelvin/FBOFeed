<DESC>Industry Day for Curriculum Development for Probation and Pretrial Services Office<br />**This Notice duplicates information&nbsp;provided in Notice AOUSC-ID-16-0001**<br /><br />The Probation and Pretrial Services Office and the Procurement Management Division of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) will be holding an Industry Day to discuss the requirements for the development of curriculum that can be used by probation officers and treatment providers to teach offenders the necessary skills to change their faulty thinking, steer clear of antisocial peers and develop prosocial networks, maintain employment and address educational deficits, address alcohol/drug use, and recognize triggers to violence and refrain from violent behaviors. Additionally, the AO is tasked to develop and implement a self-paced curriculum for offenders and offenders' support networks to follow so the offenders can independently work on these identified skills.<br /><br />The attached document is a rough draft of our requirements for this project, which is estimated to be from $5 to $10 million. It is provided for your review and to facilitate an interactive discussion during the Industry Day, particularly as it relates to the format of the Schedule of Items, the Statement of Work, the deliverable schedule, the Key Personnel requirements, and the proposal preparation instructions.<br /><br />We welcome any thoughts, recommendations, or questions in advance of the forum, so we may consider those as we prepare. There will also be the opportunity to submit questions (anonymously, if preferred) and to participate in the discussion during the Industry Day.
<p>The Industry Day will be held in the Mecham Conference Center at the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building (TMFJB), One Columbus Circle NE, Washington DC 20544, from 10 AM to 12 noon on Wednesday, January 13, 2016. Interested parties are invited to attend in person or through web-enabled participation.</p>
<p>Please reply no later than noon, Wednesday, January 6, 2016, to janet_peterson@ao.uscourts.gov and michelle_hupp@ao.uscourts.gov indicating if you will attend in person or online. If in person, include the names of all attendees so we can provide that to our Security Staff for admission to the TMFJB. A valid photo ID must be submitted at the South Guard Station, without exception. If participating online, include the email address of everyone so we can send an invitation with a link to the webcast.</p>

Grease trap drainage and floor-drain preventive maintenance services

This is a pre-solicitation notice for a grease trap drainage and floor-drain preventive maintenance service contract. Network Contracting Office (NCO) 22, Long Beach, CA intends to solicit and negotiate a firm-fixed-price contract to provide the required services at VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VAGLAHS) located at 11301 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90073. The Contractor shall provide said services Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Holidays, or as indicated in the resulting solicitation. This contract will have one base year and up to two option years. Anticipated start date is on or around January 25, 2016. 

SCOPE: VAGLAHS is provided with a grease trap located between the food preparation facilities, drain lines, and the wastewater disposal system. The grease trap intercepts most greases and solids from our kitchens before they enter the wastewater disposal system. The required services are needed to drain ("extract" or "pump-out") the wastewater from the grease trap which contains large amounts of oil from food production in kitchens before the grease trap is overwhelm. In addition, the required services include floor-drain preventive maintenance to avoid our floor-drains and floor sink-drains to become clogged with high-viscosity fats and cooking greases before disposed solids and liquids form blockages in our drain pipes.
 
The applicable NAICS Code is 812930, Parking Lots and Garages (SBA size standard $35.5 Million). The solicitation will be 100% set-aside for small businesses. 

NOTE - A SOLICITATION IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.  The solicitation will be available on or around January 11, 2016 and will be published on the FBO website (www.fbo.gov). 

This is a pre-solicitation notice synopsizing an upcoming solicitation to satisfy the requirements of FAR 5.201 and 5.203.  The Contracting Specialist will not be able to answer any questions pertaining to this notice until a solicitation is issued.  A one-time Site Visit will take place after the posting of the solicitation in order to afford all interested parties equal opportunity to observe the physical characteristics of the Medical Center and the surrounding area. The date and time of this Site Visit will be posted in the solicitation. Questions resulting from the solicitation and pre-bid investigation will only be answered if received by Request for Information (RFI) via email.  It is the responsibility of the bidder to monitor and download amendments from fedbizopps which may be issued to this solicitation.

The results of the market research concluded that Medstar WHC (Dr. Shastri), is the only vendor who can provide an Oral Surgeon who is both an accomplished Oral Surgeon, Residency Trainer, and is credentialed at the NIH to the NIDCR. There is only one (1) NIH credentialed Oral Surgeon/Residency Trainer, Dr. Shastri. This credentialing process takes several months at a great cost to the Government. In addition, Dr. Shastri has performed the services as an Oral Surgeon and Resident Trainer for the Dental Clinic for the past four (4) years, as such, if Dr. Shastri were to be replaced her patients would have to be completely reevaluated by another doctor negating four (4) years of patient relations and intimate knowledge of patient needs. Dr. Shastri has a comprehensive understanding of the complex patients and their unique conditions that bring them to the NIH. This experience is unique to the NIH as many patients have rare diseases, undiagnosed conditions, or participate in clinical studies that require an thorough understanding of conducting surgeries in the setting of a research protocol. This is NOT common at other hospitals or medical centers. Without the experience of Dr. Shastri in managing complex diseases and functioning within a research protocol, many protocols would be significantly delayed and the current relationship with multiple patients and investigators would be compromised.</p>
<p>A sources sought was posted on FedBizOps (FBO) on 12/16/15 for a period of 13 days. No other vendors provided a capability statement.</p>

<p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration <br />Acquisition and Grants Office</p>
<p>Professional and Technical Services (ProTech)</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Professional and Technical Services Program, hereafter referred to as ProTech, is designed to establish a portfolio of Bureau-wide, Multiple Award, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (MA-IDIQ) contracts for professional and technical support services that will assist the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Line and Staff Offices in accomplishing their mission objectives. ProTech requirements will be categorized into five Domains: <br />(1) Satellites, (2) Oceans, (3) Fisheries, (4) Weather, and (5) Enterprise Operations.</p>
<p>These Domains best represent the specialized needs of NOAA's Line and Staff Offices. The resulting contracts will be awarded per Domain. The contractors shall provide services in accordance with task orders awarded in the Domain for which they have received an IDIQ contract. Offerors will be permitted to propose in multiple Domains, but are encouraged to focus on Domains within their firm's core competencies. <br />DRAFT Request for Proposal:</p>
<p>NOAA's Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) is seeking industry comments on a draft Request for Proposals (RFP) for Professional and Technical Services. <br />The attached RFP is a DRAFT only. While this draft RFP includes information for all five domains, the government will not solicited and award contracts for all five domains at the same time in one RFP. Final RFPs for Domains will be released on a staggered time line, either individually or in combination of two or more. At this time, the Government anticipates a final RFP for the Satellites Domain as the first to be released in the 3QFY16. There will be an industry day for just the Satellites Domain in the early March timeframe. A separate announcement will be released with the details for this industry day. Separate industry days will be conducted prior to the release of each Domain's final RFP.</p>
<p>The Government is requesting all interested vendors review this draft RFP and provide questions or comments no later than Friday, February 1, 2016 via email to pro-tech@noaa.gov. Please use the draft RFP Attachment J-7, RFP Question and Comment Template for question and comment submissions. Responses to the questions and comments will be posted on the NOAA ProTech webpage.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation announcement is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a final Request for Proposals (RFP) or a promise to issue a final RFP in the</p>
<p>future. This request does not commit the Government to contract for any supplies or services whatsoever. NOAA is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Not responding to this announcement does not preclude participation in any future solicitation.</p>

version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or
manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other
sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source
part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered
and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review
discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and
cannot be economically obtained. The subject item requires Government source

a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval
of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together

<p>1.5.1.1.1 A plan indicating the location and proposed schedule of weighing operations shall be submitted for approval in accordance with PARAGRAPH: SUBMITTALS.</p>
<p>1.5.2. Payment. Riprap material shall be measured and paid for by the net ton (2,000 pound avoirdupois) of acceptable material delivered as specified to the designated delivery sites.</p>
<p>2. PRODUCTS.</p>
<p>2.1 MATERIALS.</p>
<p>2.1.1 Riprap material shall be durable quarried stone of suitable quality to ensure permanence in the Upper Mississippi River environment. Stone shall be of a suitable quality to ensure permanence in the structure and in the climate in which it is to be used. It shall be free from cracks, blast fractures, bedding, seams and other defects that would tend to increase its deterioration from natural causes. A crack is considered to be detrimental if it is more than four (4) mil wide and is continuous for one-third the dimension of at least two sides of the stone.</p>
<p>2.1.2 Specific gravity. All stone shall have a specific gravity of not less than 2.55 and not more than 2.75.</p>
<p>2.1.3 Riprap Shape. Neither the breadth nor thickness of any individual stone shall be less than one-third its length.</p>
<p>2.1.4 Riprap Gradations. Riprap shall be reasonably well graded within the specified limits shown on the riprap gradation curves contained in Attachment 4 to permit construction of relatively dense riprap sections. Inclusion of objectionable quantities of dirt, sand, clay, rock fines or other deleterious materials will not be allowed.</p>
<p>2.1.5 Riprap Processing. On the same date the Contractor provides the submittal for material sources, it shall also submit for approval the method of processing riprap at each quarry that will preclude the inclusion of objectionable amounts of fine material or organic matter. All riprap shall be processed in accordance with the method approved. Quarry-run riprap will not be accepted. All rock designated for use as riprap shall be processed over a vibratory grizzly or by an approved alternate method to insure the exclusion of poor quality rock.</p>
<p>2.2 SOURCES AND EVALUATION.</p>
<p>2.2.1 Approved material Sources are provided in Attachment 2. Rock materials may be produced from the sources listed in Attachment 2 for any of the identified sites requiring rock. The Contractor may elect to furnish rock from another source(s) not listed in Attachment 2 provided the source is approved by the Contracting Officer and meets the conditions hereinafter stated. If the Contractor proposes to furnish materials from a source not listed, the Government Geologist will make such investigations and evaluations as necessary to determine whether or not materials meeting the requirements of this contract can be produced from the proposed source. The Contractor shall be responsible for making its own investigations for sources of suitable materials and for making its own arrangements with the owners of the quarries or land for procuring the required quantities of suitable materials.</p>
<p>2.2.1.1 Within 7 days after contract award, the Contractor shall designate and submit for approval only one source or one combination of sources from which it proposes to furnish the materials for each site or for multiple sites. If the Contractor proposes to furnish materials from sources not listed in Attachment 2, they may designate a single or combination of sources for each site or combination sites. The contractor will only be allowed to submit one alternate source proposal. Samples for acceptance testing shall be provided as required by the PARAGRAPH: TESTS FOR ACCEPTABILITY. If a source for materials so designated by the Contractor is not approved for use by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor may not submit for approval other sources but shall furnish the materials from approved sources selected from the list in Attachment 2, at no additional cost to the Government.</p>
<p>2.2.1.2 Approval of a source of materials is not to be construed as approval of all material from that source. The right is reserved by the Government to reject materials from certain localized areas, zones, strata, or channels when such materials are unsuitable as determined by the Government Geologist. Materials produced from an approved source shall meet all of the requirements of this specification.</p>
<p>2.2.2. No riprap material shall be obtained from any river facing bluffs that are visible from the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>2.3 TESTS FOR ACCEPTABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCE MATERIAL.</p>
<p>2.3.1 Quality tests and service records will be used to determine the acceptability of stone materials. In the event suitable test reports and satisfactory service records are not available, as in the case of newly operated sources, the materials will be tested to determine acceptability. Tests to which the materials may be subjected to include petrographic analysis, specific gravity, soundness, abrasion, absorption, freezing and thawing, and other tests considered necessary to demonstrate acceptability. Tests will be made by, or under the supervision of, the Government and at the Government's expense.</p>
<p>2.3.2 Samples. When directed by the Contracting Officer, suitable samples of materials shall be submitted for approval prior to delivery of materials to the work site. Samples shall be obtained by the Contractor, in the presence of the Contracting Officer or its designated representative, and delivered at the Contractor's expense to a point designated by the Contracting Officer, at least<br />7 days in advance of the date that the material is required to be delivered.</p>
<p>2.4 RIPRAP GRADATION TESTING.</p>
<p>2.4.1 General Requirements. Gradation tests shall be performed by the methods and at the frequency listed below. Testing listed herein shall be completed by and at the expense of the Contractor. Gradation testing results shall be submitted utilizing the gradation plots for the required riprap gradations and the WORKSHEET FOR GRADATION ANALYSIS OF RIPRAP (gradation plots and blank copies of the worksheets are included in the attachments section). The Contracting Officer shall direct the time and location of sampling, unless waived. The Contracting Officer shall be informed 24 hours before each test is performed. The results of all tests, including failing tests shall be submitted on the appropriate gradation plots and worksheets. The Contracting Officer shall be informed immediately of test results and draft copies of test results shall be submitted at the Contracting Officer's request. Tests performed on material that does not meet gradation and shape requirements will not be counted as part of the tests required.</p>
<p>2.4.2 Test Method A. Test method A shall consist of weighing all stones larger than 5 pounds in a sample. Five to seven weight classes shall be selected within the range of stone sizes. Each stone shall be weighed and recorded on the worksheet for method A. The weight of stones shall be summed for each weight class; after which calculations and a plot of the gradation shall be completed in accordance with accepted practice for soil and aggregate gradations.</p>
<p>2.4.3 Test Method B. Test method B shall consist of separating the stones into 5 to 7 piles, ordered by size. The sample shall be separated on a clean, hard surface that is free of smaller stones that could become mixed with the sample. The stones shall be visually screened to place them into appropriate piles. All stones shall be separated and placed into a pile before weighing. After separating, the smallest and largest rock in each pile shall be weighed and recorded. The stones shall be adjusted as necessary so that the weight classes do not overlap. After adjustment is adequate and weight classes have been established, each pile of stone shall be weighed and recorded on the worksheet for method B. Calculations and a plot of the gradation shall be completed in accordance with accepted practice for soil and aggregate gradations.</p>
<p>2.4.4 Scales. Accuracy of scales shall as required in paragraph: Measurement.</p>
<p>2.4.5 Testing. A sample shall be obtained from each approved material source or combination of sources for each gradation required and tested in accordance with either method A or B. A satisfactory test shall be obtained from each source or combination of sources for each gradation prior to hauling any riprap from that quarry. All samples shall have a minimum gross weight of 3,000 pounds.</p>
<p>2.4.6 Testing Frequency. Gradation tests will be required at a frequency of 1 per 5,000 tons of each gradation of material from a specific source that is brought on each site, with a minimum of one test per site per gradation. Tests that do not meet gradation requirements will not be counted.</p>
<p>2.5 Corrective Action. If materials from an approved source fail to meet gradation or shape requirements, the Contractor shall adjust its operations and verify with necessary tests that acceptable materials are being produced, or it shall propose another source and verify, with necessary tests, that acceptable material can be produced from that source.</p>
<p><br />3. EXECUTION.</p>
<p>3.1 SCHEDULE. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor 15 days in advance of when delivery is to commence at a particular site. The Contractor shall provide the riprap gradation submittals for approval no later than 7 days prior to delivery of material to that site. It is anticipated that commencement of delivery will occur between the dates of February 15, 2016 through December 14 2016. Delivery shall commence no later than 15 calendar days following notification from the Contracting Officer and shall continue on consecutive work days until completed, unless directed otherwise by the Contracting Officer. The delivery period at the site shall be within the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, unless directed otherwise by the Contracting Officer. No delivery shall be made on weekends or Federal holidays.</p>
<p>The time period between when delivery to one site has been completed and delivery to the next site is initiated is dependent on the Government's placement schedule and is anticipated to range between a few days to several weeks.</p>
<p>3.2 COORDINATION. The Contractor shall not block access to the loading docks or access routes at the on-land delivery sites for extended periods of time and shall coordinate loading access routes and dock use with the following:</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government currently intends to award a contract for Maintenance for Thermo Fisher Scientific ISQ mass Spectrometer and Trace GC instruments on an SOLE SOURCE basis, but is seeking vendors that may be able to perform this requirement in order to support a competitive procurement. Accordingly, the U.S. Government highly encourages all interested businesses (large and small) to respond to this sources sought synopsis. In addition, small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), must describe their identifying capabilities in meeting the requirements at a fair market price, i.e., information which may help support a set-aside.
<p>The proposed sole source Firm Fixed Price contract to Thermo Fisher Scientific for Maintenance Services. The statutory authority for the sole source procurement is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1): For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name, or industrial mobilization) Attached is the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS),</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The NAICS code(s) is: 811219 Laboratory instrument repair and maintenance services with a size standard of $20,500,000.00.</p>
<p><br />In response to this sources sought, please provide:</p>
<p>1. Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition and identify alternatives or solution solutions. Also contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Dean Carsello, at dean.m.carsello.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-2419, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the Sources Sought Synopsis. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
<p>2. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, identify business size (large business or a small business), and if applicable, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>3. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>4. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.</p>
<p>5. Information to help determine if the requirement (item or service) is commercially available, including pricing information, basis for the pricing information (e.g., market pricing, catalog pricing), delivery schedules, customary terms and conditions, warranties, etc.</p>
<p>6. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition, including competition among small business concerns.</p>

The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future requirements.

Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'*.

<DESC><p>There are two Request for Information (RFI) associated with the Downstream Cofferdam at Kentucky Lock Project. First, is a general RFI to determine a competitive basis. Second, is a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) RFI to determine if use of a PLA is appropriate for this project. We request that you respond to both.<br /><br />The Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) anticipates a requirement for a firm fixed-price construction contract to accomplish the following work* at Kentucky Lock project:</p>
<p>Major components of the Downstream Cofferdam contract include:</p>
<p>1) Approximately 25,000 CY of underwater overburden excavation and approximately 8,500 CY of underwater rock excavation (all material will be disposed of in onsite disposal areas); <br />2) Both land based and overwater exploratory drilling; <br />3) 483 linear feet of a concrete segmental wall with a typical cross section of 46.5' wide by 60' tall (expected but not required to be constructed partially in-the-wet); <br />4) Four 69' diameter, granular filled sheet pile cells along with associated connecting arcs with a typical height of 70' and all with a tremie concrete plug at their bases; <br />5) A tied Z-pile connecting wall to high ground with a width of 59' and length of 150';<br />6) Two 41' diameter sheet pile guard cells, one is concrete filled and the other granular filled; <br />7) Approximately 4500 tons of underwater riprap placement for construction of a training dike; and<br />8) Relocation of all mussels from within the underwater footprint of the worksite to immediate locations downstream.</p>
<p>Most of the work site for this contract will be in the lower approach channel for the existing navigation lock at Kentucky Dam. As such, the contractor's operations have the potential to significantly disrupt the operation of this busy lock. This contract has been configured to minimize impacts to the movement of vessels through this lock during construction. This includes the requirement for the contractor to provide a helper boat to facilitate the movement of vessels through the lock area and will include the requirement of detailed safety plans to ensure the safe movement of these vessels past the work site when allowed. During some phases of construction, it will not be possible to provide for safe movement of vessels and this time will be allowed for in the contract.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to provide all plant, labor and materials to construct these features.</p>
<p>*Please note that this description is subject to change.</p>

Security
1. GENERAL 
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. 

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
a. A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 
b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 
c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness. 
d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor. 
e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination. 

3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE 
a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). 
b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct onsite inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. 
c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract. 
d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and 
policies in this contract. 
e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 
g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. 
h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated. 
i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request. 
j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response. 
k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR. 

6. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION 
a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. 

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. 

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.  

7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH 
a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 
b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA 
must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. 
c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following: 
(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access); 
(2) Description of the event, including: 
(a) date of occurrence; 
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code; (3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected; 
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected; 
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text; 
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); 
(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any; 
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals; 
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and 
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. 
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following: 
(1) Notification; 
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports; 
(3) Data breach analysis; 
(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; 
(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and 
(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs. 

9. TRAINING 
a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems: 

(1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;

b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. 

d.	Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

<p>W911W6-16-R-0002</p>
<p>A Broad Agency Announcement for the Aviation Development Directorate</p>
<p>For VERTICAL LIFT RESEARCH CENTER OF EXCELLENCE</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this BAA is to solicit proposals for a cooperative agreement from U.S. higher education institutions to conduct basic research focused on scientific barriers in technologies relevant to vertical lift capabilities and to provide a scientific foundation for enabling technologies for future force capabilities. This research is best conducted in a concentrated interdisciplinary center, the Vertical Lift Research Center of Excellence (VLRCOE), which will couple state-of-the-art research programs at academic institutions with broad-based graduate education programs to strengthen the academia's contribution to vertical lift research and technology. This VLRCOE Program is funded by the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and is managed by the U.S. Army Aviation Development Directorate - Aeroflightdynamics Directorate (AFDD) located at Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. It is intended to support the long-term basic research objectives of the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, and NASA, to establish a significant dual-use technology base from which the military aviation community and the rotorcraft industry can draw substantial knowledge and capability, and to provide a source of highly qualified rotorcraft research professionals for future DoD program needs. The VLRCOE program extends and updates the U.S. Army's continuing support of a Rotorcraft Centers of Excellence Program initiated in 1982. This announcement covers the VLRCOE program for five (5) program years, initiating in the Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2016 through 2021.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The goal of the VLRCOE program is to create a highly collaborative environment that fosters synergetic relations between academic/research partners, both domestic and international, with expertise-driven teams focused on vertical lift basic research. It is desired that the proposing U.S. higher education institution must offer a wide range of faculty capabilities and course work in multiple disciplines relevant to vertical lift research to establish a cohesive &lsquo;Center.' A Center may be composed of a lead university and partner universities collaborating to expand the scope of the program to address the widest range of technical fields. In addition, collaborative research tasks with individual investigators from other universities are also encouraged to enhance the Center's program content with complementary capabilities.</p>
<p>VLRCOE proposals submitted under this BAA should include research tasks in at least four of the following fields: (1) Aeromechanics, (2) Structures and Materials, (3) Flight Dynamics and Control, (4) Advanced Vertical Take-Off and Landing Design and Concepts, (5) Vibration and Noise Control, (6) Propulsion, (7) Affordability, (8) Safety and Survivability, and (9) Human Factors Engineering. In addition, each proposal should include at least one task relevant to specialized Naval Science &amp; Technology areas of interest. Tasks in additional fields not explicitly mentioned will also be considered provided they directly address the objectives of the BAA.</p>
<p>Research tasks should be focused on fundamental scientific issues that are of importance to vertical lift, and that have the potential for making significant contributions towards U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps research thrusts, and are aligned with DoD and NASA goals and missions. Technology transfer and the partnering of this research endeavor with the U.S. rotorcraft industry, the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, NASA, and other Government organizations (e.g., FAA) and other academic institutions are encouraged.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES: Each year the VLRCOE shall present an annual program review highlighting the progress and research accomplished during each program year. The VLRCOE shall provide a written summary status report for each research task, as well as the presentation and supporting materials for the annual review. At the end of the five-year program, a final program report is required for the entire five-year program. The final report shall include the VLRCOE's overall accomplishments, research paper publications, degree recipients along with subsequent career paths, patents filed, technical accomplishments of each task, and technology transfer initiatives. The VLRCOE shall submit Federal Financial Reports (SF 425) on a quarterly basis and a final within 90 days after the Agreement expiration date.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD: The anticipated total Government funding for the program is approximately $4,200,000 per year over the five-year program duration. However, the total proposed budget for each proposal shall not exceed $2,500,000 per year. It is intended that a Center will be a competitive environment, both within each individual Center and between the Centers, in which the annual program review will provide opportunities for evaluating progress on technical tasks and making changes to the program as needed. Although a five-year program with specific tasks will be negotiated for each Center prior to award, the Government reserves the right, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement governing modifications and additional research, to limit the period of performance for certain tasks to a shorter duration, to add new tasks or make changes to existing tasks as additional Government funding becomes available and/or funding is redirected from tasks that are not productive.</p>
<p>TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT: The Government anticipates an award of a Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358, as the Government desires to be substantially involved in the performance of the VLRCOE Program. The Government is seeking at least 50% cost share to the maximum extent practicable. The purpose of the cost share is to ensure the recipients have a vested interest in the program's success, and the Offerors are encouraged to include cost share to the maximum extent practicable. Cost share may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project. Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, 32 CFR 32.23 (Cost Share Matching) (Cooperative Agreement) (accessible at the following link: http://www.ecfr.gov/.</p>
<p>Proposals are due by 4:00 pm EDT, April 15, 2016. Please use the solicitation number, W911W6-16-R-0002, in any inquiries or correspondence regarding this announcement. An objective Government panel with appropriate expertise will evaluate the proposals. Selection of proposals for negotiation is planned to be completed by June 6, 2016. Awards under this announcement are anticipated to be made by July 31, 2016. However, unless the Offeror specifies a different expiration time, proposals will be considered valid for Government acceptance through September 30, 2016. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received. Further, the Government reserves the right to select for award only a portion of an Offeror's proposal.</p>

<p>VERTICAL LIFT RESEARCH CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE<br />Appendix A: PROGRAM INFORMATION PACKAGE</p>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>The purpose of this BAA is to solicit proposals for a cooperative agreement from U.S. higher education institutions to conduct basic research focused on scientific barriers in technologies relevant to vertical lift capabilities and to provide a scientific foundation for enabling technologies for future force capabilities. This VLRCOE Program is funded by the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and is managed by the U.S. Army Aviation Development Directorate - AFDD located at Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. It is intended to support the long-term basic research objectives of the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, and NASA, to establish a significant dual-use technology base from which the military aviation community and the rotorcraft industry can draw substantial knowledge and capability, and to provide a source of highly qualified rotorcraft research professionals for future DoD program needs.</p>
<p>Since 1982, the U.S. Army has continuously supported a successful Vertical Lift Research Centers of Excellence Program, formerly called the Rotorcraft Centers of Excellence Program. The current five-year program concludes in September 2016. Consequently, the U.S. Army Aviation Development Directorate has issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to support basic vertical lift technology research. This program information package is part of a supplemental package prospective Offerors must review to propose successfully under the BAA.</p>
<p>1.2 Conformance to Guidance</p>
<p>Proposals should conform to the procedural and submission guidelines covered in these instructions. Proposals should be as complete as possible and be submitted on the Offerors' most favorable terms.</p>
<p>In order to be considered responsive to the solicitation, a submission must, at a minimum, describe the range of faculty capabilities and appropriate vertical lift-related course work in a number of disciplines to establish a Center; present research projects (tasks) to be conducted by the Center within at least four areas of interest identified in this BAA; contain sufficient technical, management and cost information to perform a meaningful evaluation; be signed by an official authorized to legally bind the proposing organization; not merely offer to perform standard services or to just provide services; and not significantly duplicate a more specific, current, or pending DoD or NASA solicitation. The U.S. Army reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received in response to this BAA when such action is considered in the best interest of the Government. The Government further reserves the right to award only a part of any proposal submitted pursuant to this BAA.</p>
<p>2. BAA Objectives &amp; Proposal Guidelines</p>
<p>The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit proposals for cooperative agreements from U.S. higher education institutes to maintain graduate education courses, and conduct basic research focused on technical issues relevant to progress in vertical lift technology in a concentrated interdisciplinary center. This program is intended to support the long-term basic research needs of the DoD and NASA, and the civil and military rotary-wing aviation. Proposals should follow the formats defined in Appendix B.</p>
<p>VLRCOE proposals submitted under this BAA should include research tasks from at least four of the following fields:<br /><br />(1) Aeromechanics,</p>
<p>(2) Structures and Materials,</p>
<p>(3) Flight Dynamics and Control,<br /><br />(4) Advanced Vertical Take-Off and Landing Design and Concepts,<br /><br />(5) Vibration and Noise Control,</p>
<p>(6) Propulsion,</p>
<p>(7) Affordability,</p>
<p>(8) Safety and Survivability</p>
<p>(9) Human Factors Engineering</p>
<p>In addition, all proposals should include at least one task specifically relevant to Naval Science &amp; Technology areas of interest. Tasks in additional fields not listed may also be proposed provided they directly address the objectives of the BAA.</p>
<p>Research should be focused on basic scientific issues that are of importance to vertical lift and that have the potential for making significant contributions towards U.S. Army and U.S. Navy research thrusts and are aligned with DoD and NASA goals and missions. Interdisciplinary research efforts should be emphasized, but should be focused on fundamental physical phenomena or understandings.</p>
<p>Technical proposals should clearly describe the background and objectives of the proposed research, the approaches to be considered, the level of effort to be employed, the anticipated results, and the manner in which the work will contribute to the U.S. industry and military aviation. Plans should be discussed for proactively transferring the technology and partnering of these research endeavors to the rotorcraft industry and military aviation communities.</p>
<p>Proposals should describe plans for attracting the highest caliber graduate students into the Vertical Lift Research Center of Excellence Program.</p>
<p>The purpose of VLRCOE is to provide a critical mass of multi-disciplinary research capability focused on vertical lift research. A broad range of faculty expertise and appropriate rotorcraft related course work in several disciplines is required to establish a center. In order to achieve adequate program balance, subcontracts with other universities may be proposed. Leadership of teams proposing to this program must reside with U.S. higher education institutions. Supporting or subcontracting participation is open to all U.S. organizations, including Federal Laboratories. In general, U.S. Federal Government Agencies that participate as team members are expected to supply their own funding. Inclusion of Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI) as subcontractors is highly encouraged. International collaborations with non-U.S. organizations are also encouraged to complement the center program by bringing in unique technical expertise. However, non-U.S. organizations, as well as work performed by non-U.S. organizations as a part of the proposal submitted by a U.S. organization, are not eligible for funding under this BAA.</p>
<p>3. Program Schedule</p>
<p>The schedule for the review and selection of proposals for the Vertical Lift Research Center of Excellence Program is as follows:</p>
<p>December 31, 2015 Release of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)<br />January 22, 2016 Pre-proposal Conference (Academia Day)<br />April 15, 2016 Proposals due<br />July 31, 2016 Agreement Awards</p>
<p>A pre-proposal "Academia Day" will be held on Friday, January 22, 2016 from 1:30-5:00pm at Holiday Inn Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, CA. At "Academia Day" the Technical Leads from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and NASA will describe their technical plans. "Academia Day" Registration information form is attached as Appendix E. All forms shall be submitted via email by Thursday, January 14, 2016 as directed on the registration form.</p>
<p>A cooperative agreement awarded as a result of this BAA will provide for a basic performance period of 5 years. The Government will assess the overall performance of the program at the end of each year. It is intended that the center will be a competitive environment in which the annual program review will provide opportunities for evaluating progress on technical tasks and making changes to the program as needed. Although a five-year program with specific tasks will be negotiated for each center prior to award, the Government reserves the right, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement governing modifications and additional research, to make changes to existing research tasks, to add new tasks as additional Government funding becomes available and/or to redirect funding from tasks that are not deemed productive or aligned with the program intent.</p>

<p>6. EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>The selection of primary sources (i.e., Centers or VLRCOEs) for award will be based on an evaluation of proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth below and in the Supplemental Package.</p>
<p>To be selected, proposing U.S. higher education institutions must offer a range of faculty capabilities and appropriate vertical lift-related course work in a number of disciplines to establish a &lsquo;Center.' A Center may be composed of a lead university and partner universities collaborating to provide the scope of program necessary to address the widest range of technical fields relevant to vertical lift technology. Intra-university and inter-university research teams are encouraged. The tasks performed by the partner universities and individual investigators are encouraged to be collaborative with the lead university rather than standalone tasks. There are no fixed percentages, for personnel or funding, for the lead university, partner university/universities, or individual investigator(s).</p>
<p>Research tasks will be competitively selected based on technical merit, relevance, and program balance. The distribution of funding will be based on the technical selection of the tasks. The five-year program research tasks will be subjected to a scientific peer review by a team of knowledgeable scientists/engineers. The research tasks will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to research proposed by other Offerors under this announcement. These evaluations will result in narrative ratings, which will be used to develop an order of merit ranking for proposals and technical programs submitted under this announcement. Proposed cost will be evaluated as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness, concurrently with the scientific peer review. Note that it is possible for a proposal to be excluded from the competition if it is deemed to lack the established merits to establish a "Center" based upon the following criteria. These criteria are equally weighted as part of the overall assessment of the viability of the Offeror to become a VLRCOE:</p>
<p>6.1 Center Criteria:</p>
<p>The following primary criteria will be used to determine the establishment of a "Center":</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Critical mass of technical expertise within the Center and the balance of technical tasks;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Vertical lift technology courses offered to graduate students within the Center or easily available through electronic, remote access;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Partner universities and individual investigators from other universities to strengthen the Center's program;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Access to test facilities and equipment to build a cohesive experimental program;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Cost sharing and university support as stated in this announcement;</p>
<p>Partnerships with other universities that complement both the experimental facilities as well as technical expertise of the Center are strongly encouraged, and could result in greater evaluation credit. The proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art and thus the amount of cost-sharing percentage could result in greater evaluation credit.</p>
<p>Additional factors that enhance the establishment of a "Center" and may result in greater evaluation credit are: Participation of Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI); participation of other small or minority-owned businesses; international collaboration; and technology transition plans such as internship programs for graduate students to be mentored at Government labs.</p>
<p>6.2 Technical Task Criteria:</p>
<p>The technical tasks will be evaluated using the following criteria:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Scientific merits and quality of the technical approaches of the proposed research tasks; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Uniqueness of the proposed task, how it complements the government science and technology portfolio, and its relevance to the advancement of U.S. military vertical lift technologies and the competitive position of the U.S. rotorcraft industry;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Qualifications and past contributions of the principal investigators and other key research personnel in the proposed research area; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Collaborations with other academic/research partners to complement the Center areas of expertise, and the quality of the technology transfer plan including partnering with the industry, military and federal aviation communities; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Reasonableness and consistency of proposed budget for accomplishing the proposed research.</p>
<p>Criteria (1), (2) and (3) are equal and substantially more important than (4) which is more important than (5).</p>
<p>The Technical content of the proposed Tasks is the key part of the proposals. The proposals will be evaluated by a team of knowledgeable scientists/ engineers from the DoD, and NASA. The evaluation criteria applicable to the technical tasks in the proposals will be applied to determine which of the proposed tasks will be funded in any VLRCOE agreement(s).</p>
<p>7. Intellectual Property Rights</p>
<p>7.1 Rights in Other Intellectual Property (i.e., rights in technical data, computer software, computer databases, computer software documentation):<br /><br />7.1.1 Will, in general, be negotiated on the basis of the definitions contained in the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), Part 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014.</p>
<p>7.1.2 The Government desires Government Purpose Rights in delivered Technical Data, Computer Software, Computer Databases and Computer Software Documentation.</p>
<p>7.1.3 In the event that Technical Data, Computer Software, Computer Databases and/or Computer Software Documentation were produced by Recipient at private expense prior to performance of or outside the scope of any resulting Agreement and is considered by Recipient to embody trade secrets or to comprise commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential, such information must be identified in the proposal and, if delivered to the Government may be delivered subject to Limited or Restricted Rights.</p>
<p>7.1.4 Marking instructions for any protected materials will generally conform to the requirements of DFARS Part 227.</p>
<p>7.2 Patent Rights</p>
<p>For any award made as a result of this BAA, the disposition of rights to inventions made by any participant shall be governed by Title 35 of the United States Code.</p>
<p>8. Resource Sharing</p>
<p>The Government is seeking at least 50% cost share to the maximum extent practicable. The purpose of the cost share is to ensure the recipients have a vested interest in the program's success, and the Offerors are encouraged to include cost share to the maximum extent practicable. Cost share may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project. Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, 32 CFR 32.23 (Cost Share Matching) (Cooperative Agreement) (accessible at the following link: http://www.ecfr.gov/. The value of the Offeror's contribution to the program shall be clearly documented in the proposal and follow guidelines contained in OMB Circular A-110. Note that, in general, licensing of intellectual property (or other, similar transfers) between team members will not represent a legitimate in-kind resource sharing contribution.</p>
<p>U.S. Government resources may not be considered as resource sharing. Contributions listed below will be regarded as "neutral" with regard to resource sharing goals, and they will not count as either a government or a private company contribution to resource sharing goals. These include: (a) cash or in-kind contributions provided by state or local governments (specifically for the BAA project proposal, and not generally provided for some other purpose) where the cash or in-kind resource is funded by the U.S. Government; (b) in-kind contributions by federal laboratories that are members of a proposing team (e.g., as in a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement), or (c) tangible products of past government funding that are legally owned by a member of a BAA proposal team (e.g. equipment developed as part of previous VLRCOE efforts and/or a Small Business Innovation Research contract).</p>
<p>Federal laboratories that are participants in a BAA proposal team may use resources from non-BAA sources to support the BAA proposal team (for example, a commitment of research time, paid separately) if that use is consistent with other regulatory and statutory requirements. Any planned reliance on non-BAA government resources for project implementation must be clearly documented and a commitment to provide the resources documented in the proposal.</p>
<p>9. Profit and Fees</p>
<p>Fee or profit is not allowed on this cooperative agreement.</p>
<p>10. Foreign Participation<br /><br />Participation as prime recipient is limited to U.S. institutions of higher education. The intention of this BAA is to stimulate research to strengthen U.S. research and development, with the primary benefit directed to the U.S. government and rotorcraft industry base. Companies or business entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by a foreign institution or government are ineligible for funding under this BAA. Research proposals involving collaboration with foreign institution(s) by a U.S. prime recipient will be considered provided that the work performed by the foreign institution(s) is funded independently outside of the VLRCOE program, and that the international collaborations complement the VLRCOE program by bringing in unique talent/capabilities. Institutions engaging non-US persons in research activities shall accept responsibility for and bear costs incurred in their own compliance with technology export regulations, as applicable.</p>
<p>11. Required Reports and Annual Review</p>
<p>11.1 Technical</p>
<p>A VLRCOE shall present an annual program review supported by presentation materials that will document the progress and research accomplished during each program year. A short narrative write-up documenting the progress of each research task is required along with the material presented at the review. A collection of research reports and papers published during the year should also be included with the review material. At the end of the five-year program, a final program report is required for the total five-year accomplishments, and will be due 90 days after the Agreement expiration date. The final program report should include the center's overall accomplishments, paper publications, degree recipients along with subsequent career paths, and technical accomplishments of each task.</p>
<p>Annual program reviews will be conducted by a Government team of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and management at a mutually convenient time each year for the purpose of providing program guidance and to help facilitate technology transfer.</p>
<p>11.2 Financial</p>
<p>The recipient shall submit Federal Financial Report (SF 425) within 15 days following the end of each Federal fiscal quarter (January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15), containing the actual costs incurred for the last three months and the estimated costs for the following four months.</p>
<p>The Final SF 425 shall be submitted within 90 days after the Agreement expiration date.</p>
<p>12. Cancellation of BAA<br /><br />The U.S. Army reserves the right to make no awards under this BAA and, in the absence of program funding or for any other reason, to cancel this BAA by publishing such cancellation notice in FedBizOpps. The U.S. Army assumes no liability for canceling the BAA.</p>
<p>13. Additional Information.</p>
<p>13.1 The term ''institution of higher education'' means an educational institution in any State that (1) admits as regular students only persons having a certificate of graduation from a school providing secondary education, or the recognized equivalent of such a certificate; (2) is legally authorized within such State to provide a program of education beyond secondary education; (3) provides an educational program for which the institution awards a bachelor's degree or provides not less than a 2-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward such a degree; (4) is a public or other nonprofit institution; and (5) is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association, or if not so accredited, is an institution that has been granted preaccreditation status by such an agency or association that has been recognized by the Government or the granting of preaccreditation status, has determined that there is satisfactory assurance that the institution will meet the accreditation standards of such an agency or association within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>13.2 Historically Black Colleges and Universities are those institutions determined by the Secretary of Education to meet the requirements of 34 CFR Section 608.2 (available at: http://www.ecfr.gov)). Minority Institutions are those institutions meeting the criteria contained in 10 U.S.C. Section 2323(a)(1)(C), which reads in part: "...minority institutions {as defined in section 365(3) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1067k));}, which, for the purposes of this section, shall include Hispanic-serving institutions [as defined in section 316(b)(1) of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1059c(b)(1)]."</p>
<p>13.3 MILITARY RECRUITING: This is to notify potential Offerors that any cooperative agreement awarded under this announcement to an institution of higher education must include the following term and condition: <br /><br />"As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution of higher education (as defined in 32 CFR part 216) that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution of higher education that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students. If the recipient is determined, using the procedures in 32 CFR part 216, to be such an institution of higher education during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements to the recipient, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award." <br /><br />If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 [Public Law 103-337(1994)], then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation.</p>
<p>13.4 Cooperative Agreement - A legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6305, is used to enter into a relationship the principal purpose of which is to transfer a thing of value to the recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law or the United States, rather than to acquire property or services for the DoD's direct benefit or use. Substantial involvement is expected between the DoD and the recipient when carrying out the activity under the cooperative agreement. The term does not include "cooperative research and development agreements" as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3710a. No fee or profit is allowed. <br /><br />Cooperative agreements are governed by the following regulations: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; a. OMB Circular A-21, "Cost Principles for Educational Institutions" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; b. OMB Circular A-87, "Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. OMB Circular A-110, "Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; d. OMB Circular A-122, "Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; e. OMB Circular A-133, "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; f. DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations Title 32, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter C (Educational Institutions see especially Part 32)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; g. DoD Directive 3210.6-R<br /><br />Electronic copies of OMB regulations may be obtained from: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_default/<br /><br />An electronic copy of the DoDGARs may be found at http://www.ecfr.gov.</p>

<DESC>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br />Acquisition Management Division<br />Notice of Intent for Contract Extension
<p>This notice is a synopsis in accordance with FAR 5.101 for a proposed contract action to contract SB1341-11-SE-0792 published at least 5 days before the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations and a solicitation will not be issued for this requirement.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, intends to intends to award a modification to the existing non-pre-emptible Ku-band transponder capacity on a geostationary communications satellite service under contract SB1341-11-SE-0792 for the period of July 27, 2016 to November 26, 2016 in accordance with FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements awarded to Ritenet Corp. The contract period of performance was initially for a base year plus four option periods. FAR 52.217-8 was not evaluated at the time of award.</p>
<p>The FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services was included in the initial solicitation NB688000-11-01476 originally synopsized May 25, 2011, as well as the original issuance of the contract SB1341-11-SE-0792 effective July 27, 2011. Exercise of the Option is in the best interest of the Government and is the most advantageous method of fulfilling the Agency's need for these services.</p>
<p>The 4 month extension is intended to be awarded to Ritenet Corp. under FAR 6.302-1 when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and (B) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The expected modification date for the current contract for the extension is no later than January 6, 2016, effective July 27, 2016.</p>
<p>Interested parties who can demonstrate they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST must clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. <br />Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to chendra.conklin@nist.gov.

<SOLNBR>SOL-CI-16-00010
<CONTACT>Ryle, Lisa
<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE for the USEPA Office of Research and Development, National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL), Ecosystems Research Division, Processes and Modeling Branch requires an ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (uHPLC) interfaced with a Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (ToF-MS) complete with computerized software systems for instrument operation and data analysis and reporting from Waters Corporation, to perform state-of-the-science experiments on the transformation and fate of chemicals in  environmental and biological systems.

These efforts require the unique capability to identify and quantify trace levels of compounds in a wide array of complex sample matrices.  Because many of these compounds will be unknown, the analyses will be untargeted, i.e., unknown analyte mass to charge ratios.  Considering these two factors (dirty matrices and untargeted analyses), success of this research depends upon access to high-resolution, accurate-mass instrumentation.  In pursuit of high-resolution capabilities, ultra-performance, high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) is at the forefront of laboratory instrumentation.  Among accurate-mass technologies quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) instruments stand alone in mass resolution; Q-TOFs are able to resolve ppb-range mass-to-charge ratios, about ten-fold more sensitive than the next-most sensitive orbitrap instruments.  

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the Waters Technologies, Corporation for the following parts and services. 

#176002027, 1, US Mains Cable Kit, as part of Xevo G2-XS System

#741000427, 1, SOFTWARE ADD-ON KIT INSTALL SVC, 1 DAY
These items are required for full integration and full capacity of the Waters Technologies Corporation XEVO G2-XS system available through its GSA schedule.  

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  No solicitation will be issued, however all responses received on/before December 18, 2015 will be reviewed by the Government. A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after the date of this publication/synopsis will be considered by the Government. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Award is anticipated in January 2016.

<SUBJECT>Sole Source - Hydrogeological Assessment - Niger

<RESPDATE>010716
<CONTACT>MERLE PHILLIPS, Phone 2027726319, Email phillipsmc@mcc.gov
<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent to issue a sole source contract under the requirements of FAR Part 15 and FAR 6.302-1," Other Than Full and Open Competition - one responsible source". The applicable NAICS Code is&nbsp;541618 with a size standard of $14.0M. The award will be made ICA (Ingenieurs Conseils Associes) Niger.&nbsp;
<p><br />The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) intends to issue a sole source, non-commercial for a contractor/consultant to provide expert services to prepare a hydrogeological assessment of potential groundwater resources to support the development of a Compact Program for MCC funding. MCC is launching this solicitation with the Government of Niger (GoN), acting through the Unit&eacute; de Coordination des Programmes du Millennium Challenge (UC-PMC). The services under this solicitation will be funded under a Grant Implementation Agreement By and Between the MCC and the GoN, and administered as MCC Contracted Activities. This contract is being awarded under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - "Only one responsible source" as the only viable course of action that provides uninterrupted continuation of critical services.<br />This contract will be awarded to ICA (Ingenieurs Conseils Associes), Niger, BP 11196 Niamey, Niger. There will be no change to the existing specifications or service requirements and the period of performance of the contract will be for 4.5 weeks.</p>
<p>Justification <br />Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253 &copy; (1), FAR 6.302-1, only one Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements in this case because ICA/Niger brings a particular and unmatched expertise and knowledge of the Konni irrigated perimeter, due to the previous analyses carried out by their Hydrogeologist of the zone. This was carried out for earlier efforts by the Niger Coordination Unit (UC-PMC) to understand the overall groundwater situation in the Maggia Valley, within which the project zone lies. It involved on-the-ground assessment, hydrogeological data collection, mapping and analyses. These analysis provide the foundation for more site-specific analyses required for this assignment, and can be considered a logical continuation of that work.</p>
<p>Specialized Hydrogeological expertise is rare in Niger and ICA's Hydrogeologist brings not only this technical expertise (verified by MCC's Independent Engineer), but an intimate knowledge of the project zone. ICA is therefore uniquely positioned to build on previous work to provide the requirement at modest cost and in a timely manner, utilizing local staff and laboratory resources.<br /><br />Competition: <br />Due to the highly specialized nature of this requirement and limited number of qualified Hydrogeologists in Niger, it is concluded that any other entity in-country or even from outside the country could adequately respond to a call for proposals for this assignment or provide the same level of service at a reasonable cost. Moreover, the small size of the task is not sufficient to attract non-Nigerien bidders.</p>
<p>Market Research: <br />During the course of due diligence activities, the Country Team explored the extent of local Hydrogeology expertise and did not find anyone qualified in-country available during the time frame for this assignment.</p>
<p>Identification of Interested Parties <br />As noted above, no other potential sources were identified due to the rarity of this expertise in Niger. Moreover, the cost of bringing international experts for such a small assignment would be prohibitive.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTIONS / SPECIFICATIONS / STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>1 INTRODUCTION<br />The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a Federal Corporation created under Title VI of the Foreign Operation, Export Financing, and related Programs Appropriations Act, 2004. As a United States government-owned corporation responsible for the stewardship of the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), MCC works with developing countries to promote sustainable economic growth to reduce poverty. MCC's work is based on the principle that aid is most effective in countries that promote good governance, provide economic freedom, and make investments in people. MCC provides large grants to a small number of eligible developing countries.<br />MCC looks at likely distributive effects of projects and, to the extent that data are available to perform such analyses, identifies their beneficiaries and estimates their impact on poverty reduction. Ultimately, MCC seeks significant and measurable decreases in the numbers of poor people and significant reductions of poverty. In addition, MCC-funded projects need to be implemented within a Compact period of five years. Further details on the MCC and its methodology may be viewed at http://www.mcc.gov.<br />2 SCOPE <br />The objective of this assignment is to assess the extent to which the perimeter's groundwater resources may be tapped to supplement surface water irrigation on the current perimeters and assess the potential for expanding the perimeter using groundwater resources. To this end, the Consultant shall carry out a hydrological assessment of the potential groundwater resources in the irrigated perimeter of Konni.<br />The proposed Konni Irrigation Rehabilitation consists of rehabilitating a system of two cascading surface runoff dams, a downstream collection reservoir and conduit, as well as the 2,452 HA perimeter. Over the last ten years, due to limited water supply through the system, 700 HA are not irrigated in either season and the dry season area under irrigation (maize and wheat) has diminished due to insufficient water supply. The proposed project aims to restore the system to its original intended capacity. Proposed works include potentially increasing the capacity of the dams and the collection reservoir, soil conservation in the catchment to stem the siltation problem that has constrained the capacity of the system, and repairs and rehabilitation of the irrigation system to reduce water losses and improve efficiency.<br />The Consultant will work under the overall supervision of the MCC, with day-to-day coordination in-country with the UC-PMC, in accordance with Annex 1 of this SOW.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

It also remains one of the poorest countries on earth. Despite slow but steady improvement in economic growth, as well as significant areas under protected status (approximately 38% of the country), the combination of wide-spread poverty, particularly in rural areas around those protected areas, creates a dangerous situation of the often complex battle between conservation and basic human survival. The dual linkages between poverty and environmental degradation are well documented, and in a country like Tanzania with a deforestation rate of over 400,000 hectares/year, and widespread rural poverty where about 40 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line, the unsustainable, and often illegal, utilization of natural resources flourishes.USAID/Tanzania&rsquo;s approach emphasizes the landscape-scale (ecosystem-wide) intervention as well as partnerships between government and civil society to support and inform a participatory and transparent reform process.&nbsp; The Natural Resources Management (NRM) project&rsquo;s accomplishments over the years have earned USAID a leadership role among donors working in the wildlife; Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH); Global Climate Change (GCC) and Coastal Resources sectors.<br />The Senior E/NRM Technical Advisor will provide leadership and advice on the full range of conservation and development activities and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) functions for the NRM Team.&nbsp; S/He&nbsp;will work at a senior level in a high-priority USG foreign assistance program that requires knowledge, experience, maturity, and an ability to function independently under a complex, highly demanding, frequently changing environment.

[Acceptable QL/RLs are either at or below the Reporting Limits for Full-Scan Mode Analysis and SIM Analysis for each compound listed in Table1. Laboratory's calculated MDL for each compound will be evaluated against the SCAN and SIM reporting limits listed in Table 1.]
 
5   A copy of the results from the most recent 'blind' Performance Evaluation samples analyzed by the laboratory for "VOCs in Air by Method T0-15."  Report shall include laboratory reported results, 'true values' and acceptance value range for each compound.
 
6   Documentation indicating your laboratorys capability to produce analytical data package, as described in Section Q of this SOW, and documentation indicating its capability to produce an electronic data deliverable (EDD), as described in Section R.
 
Technically Acceptable Evaluation Criteria:
Criteria will be evaluated and determined as Pass or Fail in accordance with the evaluation scheme set forth below.  A vendor will "Pass" if the submitted documentation demonstrates that the vendor has an established, comprehensive quality control system; that it has active certificate(s) of accreditation/certification or that its SOPs are relevant to the SOW; and that the results of its testing meet the required floors and ceilings as provided in this solicitation.

#1 The evaluation of the vendor's Quality Manual will be performed in order to determine whether the vendor has an established quality management system, including its policy and goals, procedures, systems, and any other resources that relate to producing high quality test results.
#2 - The evaluation of the vendor's documentation of competency/ qualifications (that is, either 2a alone, or 2b and c together) will be performed in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency Policy Directive FEM-2011-01 http://www.epa.gov/fem/pdfs/fem-lab-competency-policy.pdf and the referenced documents within that Policy Directive. This FEM requires all organizations generating environmental data to submit documentation of their competency and qualifications in the fields of sampling and/or analysis to be conducted. The applicable field of analysis is VOCs in Air by EPA Method T0-15 . For the documentation requested under this criteria, laboratories will not be given extra or less evaluation credit for selecting one type of documentation over the other.   If an offeror submits all three items, the government will look only at the documentation under 2(a).
#3- Passing MDL/DOC submission meeting, at a minimum 40 CFR Part 136 standards for acceptable MDL and DOC procedures.
#4- QLs/RLs need to be at or below the required QL stated in Table1.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at .] <br />(1) Listed end products. <br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represent award of a modification to the existing contractor Noridian Healthcare Solutios, LLC under the current contract<br />number HHSM-500-2012-M0012Z in the amount of $230,150 authorized under the American Recovery and<br />Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.<br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed in<br />law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Heal<br />Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified<br />electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH<br />payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.
<p>The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011.<br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>
