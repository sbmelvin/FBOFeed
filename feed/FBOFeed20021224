<DESC>For the past 2 years, increasing numbers of States (i.e., the U.S. States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories hereinafter collectively referred to as the "States") have been implementing the Click It or Ticket high visibility enforcement model which has resulted in increases in safety belt use rates.  This model uses a combination of high visibility enforcement coupled with paid media.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has proven that this is a potent combination that works to increase safety belt use and the Agency wants to provide the technical assistance to the States to continue to conduct this proven combination of strategies to increase safety belt use and decrease impaired driving.   Accordingly, NHTSA intends to issue a competitive Request For Proposal (RFP) on or about January 15, 2003, to solicit proposals from prospective offerors to provide direct technical assistance and consultation to State Highway Safety Offices and their public/media relations staff or contractors to help plan and implement communications campaigns - including purchased advertising in broadcast or print media - in support of the States' high visibility safety belt and/or impaired driving enforcement mobilizations.  Additionally, the prospective offeror shall be required to provide training, strategy development guidance and assistance with media events to selected States to help them plan, produce, and implement communications campaigns that support their intensified enforcement efforts for the Click It or Ticket and You Drink & Drive, You Lose campaigns.  NHTSA anticipates that most or all of the technical assistance will be in support of four safety belt and impaired driving mobilization efforts.  However, periodically, additional unforeseen technical assistance needs in support of these campaigns may occur.  In these instances, at NHTSA's discretion, the scope of work of this RFP, and any resultant Contract, shall be expanded to allow the prospective offeror to develop a plan and budget in support of these additional efforts.  NHTSA contemplates awarding an Indefinite Quantity, with fixed labor hour rates, Contract type for this effort, with an anticipated period of performance of a Base Period of thirty-six (36) months, with two twelve-month option periods.  The total period of performance (i.e., base and option periods) shall not exceed sixty (60) months.  At the release of the solicitation on or about January 15, 2003, the RFP, its amendments (if any), and related documents will become available over the Internet.  These documents shall reside on a World-Wide Web ("www") server, which may be accessed using a www browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the FedBizOpps web page is www.fedbizopps.gov or www.eps.gov.  It is the prospective offerors' responsibility to monitor the referenced Internet site for the release of this solicitation; its amendments, if any; and any other related documents.  Further, prospective offerors also have the responsibility for downloading their respective copies of the RFP, its amendments (if any), and any other related documents.

<DESC>This procurement is for the construction of two (2) waterfront fuel handling facilities that will transfer fuel to and from fuel tankers berthed at Delta and Echo Piers respectively, to and from COMNAVMAR storage tanks located at Sasa Valley and Tenjo Valley, Guam, Mariana Islands. More specifically, the subject project will provide three (3) 8-inch diameter mechanical fuel loading arms at Delta Pier and another three (3) 8-inch mechanical fuel loading arms at Echo Pier.  The work will include providing structural support to the loading arms, pier modifications, and piping connections to existing fuel manifold systems at each pier.  The work will also include providing a micronic filter vessel, rated at 150 psig in the JP-5 fuel handling system replacing existing sump pumps, one at each pier. Because the facilities to be provided are waterfront fuel handling facilities, qualified contractors must have prior experience with installation of fuel related equipment/systems/piping in highly corrosive salt water environments.  Also, since all welds provided under the subject project will be subjected to non-destructive testing and evaluation, qualified contractors must have this type of specialized experience.  
This project has been set aside as a 8(a) competitive procurement, restricted to 8(A) firms certified for participation in the 8(a) Program, who are serviced by the SBA in Regions IX and X, and who submit evidence of bonding in the amount of the price proposal. 
Source selection is considered the appropriate method for procuring this project because it provides the Government with the ability to obtain a qualified contractor based on technical merit and price competition.  
The Government intends to award this contract without discussions and will incorporate FAR 52.215-1, into the solicitation.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>This is a modification to an existing purchase order to Verbal Judo of Staten Island, New York.  The FDA has the need for the continuation of services with Verbal Judo for three additional months.  The instructional service provided by Verbal Judo is for Personal Safety/Situational planning training for the Office of Regulatory Affairs field and newly hired inspectors.  Verbal Judo is uniquely qualified to continue the instructional services for the training classes.  Any other contractor would have to ascend a learning curve that would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the FDA's requirements; also it would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition at this point.  It is anticipated that a contract for this requirement will be announced later in calendar year 2003.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Two 12' X 62' diagnostic recording trailers will be refurbished to an "as new" condition and configured so that a maximum physical security interface exists between machine and individual diagnostic stations. This control point will be located in the front of the trailer, have the option of being physically isolated from the main diagnostic recording area and control all signal paths between the machine and individual recording stations. The control point will be a fixed configuration, while the main diagnostic recording area will be completely modular. Every effort will be made to ensure structural integrity is maintained. Electrical systems will be added to rather than be reconfigured, and safety requirements will be implemented whenever possible.

Interested parties shall provide a narrative of capabilities and/or product data to Ed Martin at fax number (702) 295-9111. Other items to include are business size and point of contact information to include email address. Provide responses no later than December 31, 2002.

<SUBJECT>C--Onondaga Lake Oxygenation Demonstration Project - Firm Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services Contract Request for Qualifications
<SOLNBR>DACW49-03-R-0007
<RESPDATE>012303
<ARCHDATE>03242003
<CONTACT>Lorraine McMullen, (716) 879-4249
<DESC>NA CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The contract is for the provisions of various A-E services to prepare a Preliminary Experimental Design Plan Report for an in-lake air/oxygenation delivery system.  The contract is anticipated to be awarded in February 2003.  This an nouncement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  If a large business is selected, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  The wages and benefits of s ervice employees performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Onondaga Lake, an urban lake located in metropolitan Syracuse, New York, is approximately 4.6 miles long by 1 mile wide, has mean and maximum depths of 35 and 63 feet respectively, and a drainage basin of 248 square miles.  The major hydrologic inputs to O nondaga Lake are Nine Mile Creek, Harbor Brook, Onondaga Creek, Bloody Brook, Ley Creek and the Metropolitan Sewage Treatment Plant  (METRO).  The lake outlet is located at the northern end of the lake where it empties into the Seneca River.  The Seneca Ri ver combines with the Oneida River to become the Oswego River, which ultimately enters Lake Ontario at the City of Oswego. Onondaga Lakes present water and sediment quality and biological conditions are the result of more than a century of waste inputs.  Contributing factors include extensive quantities of treated domestic sewage, combined sewage overflows, various industrial  wastes, runoff from urban and agricultural land and leaching of various substances from hazardous waste sites around the lake. Another likely factor is the probable release of mercury, phosphorus and other contaminants from the lakes bottom sediments.  F ishing was banned in 1970 because of mercury contamination and currently, a fish advisory exists which severely limits fish consumption. Some of the water quality problems in Onondaga Lake result from the fact that the effluent from the METRO represents approximately 20% of the annual inflow to the lake, and 60-70% of the total inflow during low flow conditions.  Pollutant loading in this e ffluent may contribute to low hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations.  In addition, during late summer and early fall turnover, Onondaga Lake has undergone temporary lake-wide oxygen depletion, resulting in violation of New York States minimum DO concentration of 4 mg/L for several weeks.  The fall mixing period DO has steadily improved each year since 1998. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: As part of the Amended Consent Judgment (ACJ), entered into between New York State, Atlantic States Legal Foundation and Onondaga County in January 1998, Onondaga County is required to implement a program to improve the water quality of Onondaga Lake.  Thi s program includes determining the feasibility of oxygenating Onondaga Lake.  The Onondaga Lake Oxygenation Demonstration Project is the first step in the determination process. The scope of this contract is for the preparation of a Preliminary Experimental Design Plan Report (similar in content and detail to a facilities plan/design report) that will set forth the details and specifications to be used by others in the future to d evelop work plans to determine the feasibility and appropriateness of in-lake oxygenation.  The Preliminary Experimental Design Plan must include specifications and instructions for all critical scientific, engineering, and cost factors that are necessary for future preparation and development of plans, specifications, operation and maintenance plans, sampling and analysis plans, etc.  The Preliminary Experimental Design Plan Report must include sufficient detailed information and specifications to enable o thers to develop the appropriate work plans.   The Preliminary Experimental Design Plan Report shall, at a minimum, adequately address the following: 1.	To what deg ree will the demonstration project improve the habitat for fish and other aquatic life?  Oxygen depletion in Onondaga Lake is chronic during the warmer part of the year throughout the hypolimnion.  After overturn in the fall, dissolved oxygen levels in the  epilimnion often drop to levels that may affect fish populations and other aquatic organisms.  The timing and amounts on oxygen added to the hypolimnion must be geared to reducing both these problems.  The sampling program must conclusively demonstrate th e potential for improving fish habitat. 2.	What will be the impact of the demonstration project on the bioaccumulation of mercury and other chemical contaminants?  More specifically, how will the project affect production, release and distribution of methyl mercury in the lake system?  When diss olved oxygen is added to the hypolimnion, it is assumed that fish and other organisms will migrate into the lower waters of the lake.  Will this movement result in increased exposure to mercury and other chemical contaminants?  The project sampling program  must be designed to evaluate this possibility. 3.	What potential changes in water chemistry can be expected during the Lake Oxygenation Project and how will the sampling program address these changes?  Parameters of particular interest include soluble reactive phosphorus, suspended solids and water cla rity.  What changes in habitat, biota and biological communities would be expected as a result of these changes?  How will they be documented and evaluated? 4.	Does or can the Lake Oxygenation Project be designed to produce a uniform lake-wide dissolved oxygen concentration that is at a minimum level to support a healthy fish community? 5.	Will the Lake Oxygenation Project reduce the release of phosphorus from the bottom sediments?  What impact will this have on the phosphorus budget for the lake? 6.	Should the demonstration project be conducted at a whole-lake scale, a partial lake scale or at a series of scales encompassing this range?  What is the best way to phase a series of scaled experiments? 7.	What are the economic and regulatory obstacles to scaling up the demonstration project to a permanent long-term oxygenation project? 8.	How will the project affect lake stratification and turnover regimes, and with what effect on lake ecology? 9.	What is the energy efficiency of the process? 10.	What are the operation and maintenance cost estimates for the process? 11.	How much land area will be occupied? SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Firms having the capabilities to perform this work and desiring consideration for selection are invited to submit six (6) copies of a completed SF 254, unless a current copy is on file at the address listed below, and six copies of SF 255, by 30 JANUARY 20 02.  Additionally, responding firms are requested to provide six (6) copies of an overview narrative intended to demonstrate the firms understanding of the subject project.

<DESC>The Government is planning to award a contract to certified 8(A) firms (including Native Alaskan Americans) for the construction of two (2) waterfront fuel handling facilities that will transfer fuel to and from fuel tankers berthed at Delta and Echo Piers respectively, to and from COMNAVMAR storage tanks located at Sasa Valley and Tenjo Valley, Guam, Mariana Islands.
More specifically, the subject project will provide three (3) 8-inch diameter mechanical fuel loading arms at Delta Pier and another three (3) 8-inch mechanical fuel loading arms at Echo Pier.  The work will include providing structural support to the loading arms, pier modifications, and piping connections to existing fuel manifold systmes at each pier.  The work will also include providing a micronic filter vessel, rated at 150 psig, in the JP-5 fuel handling system replacing existing sump pumps, one at each pier.
Because the facilities to be provided are waterfront fuel handling facilities, qualified contractors must have prior experience with installation of fuel related equipment/systems/
piping in highly corrosive salt water environments.  Also, since all welds provided under the subject project will be subjected to non-destructive testing and evaluation, qualified contractors must have this type of specialized experience.  Estimated range of construction: between $1M and $5M.
Qualified, certified 8(a) firms, interested to be considered for this project are requested to submit evidence of past performance/experience for at least 2-3 projects similar in scope, dollar value, and remote location by the dead line of 12 September 2002 to the attention of Mrs. King, PACNAVFACENGCON, A-e/Construction Contracts Branch, 4262 Radford Drive, HONOLULU, HI 96818.

This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company?s overall financial status.  

Products being considered for addition are: Skilcraft Aerosol Cleaners (7930-00-NIB-0191, Glass Pro; 7930-00-NIB-0190, Office Plus; 7930-00-NIB-0224, X-Spot Carpet Stain Remover; 7930-00-NIB-0192, Maximum; 7930-00-NIB-0223, Clean 'N' Disinfect).

In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm?s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 

To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  

You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 

When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

11.  EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

General
USAID will award the contract to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to USAID based on (1) the merits of the offer and (2) the offeror's capability, as explained in the following sections.   

Merits of Offer

USAID will determine the merits of each offer on the basis of: (1) Its acceptability and (2) Its price reasonableness.

a. Acceptability.  USAID will determine the acceptability of each offer on the basis of its compliance with instructions.  
b. Price Reasonableness.  USAID will evaluate the reasonableness of the price of each acceptable offer in relation to the offeror's relative capability. 


Capability of the Offeror

USAID will assess (evaluate) the capability of each offeror on the basis of (a) its organizational experience, and (b) its organizational past performance.  

a. 	Organizational Experience.  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  USAID will evaluate each offeror's experience on the basis of its breath, its depth, and its relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective contract.  Organizations that do not have a past organizational experience record will receive a neutral rating.

b.	Organizational Past Performance   Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  USAID will contact some of the offeror's customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, USAID will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases.  

Contractors with recent USAID experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided USAID.  USAID will consider the performance that has been previously rendered to USAID to be more influential than past performance from another source.
  

All proposals should be submitted within the content of this solicitation on January 2, 2002 at 4:00 p.m.  Proposals can be submitted via DC mail at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Room 7.10-061, Washington, DC 20523.  POC: Gwendolyn Ruffin or email to gruffin@usaid.gov.  The proposed procurement is 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns. 

The selection will consist of a Best Value source selection process based upon merits of the offer and the offeror's capability.  Under a best value source selection, nonprice evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  USAID will consider an Offeror's past performance and experience to be more important than its price.  However, the USAID will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  In order to select the winning proposal, USAID will rank each offeror by making a series of paired comparisons between them, trading off the marginal differences in capability and the price.  The selection authority will decide whether the marginal difference in capability is worth the marginal difference in price.
