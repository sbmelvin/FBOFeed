<DESC>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) - Contracting Office - Defense Healthcare Management Systems (CO-DHMS), in support of the Program Executive Office for Defense Healthcare Management Systems (PEO DHMS) Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) Program Office, intends to issue a sole source modification to contract N00039-15-D-0044 with Leidos, Inc. of Reston, VA, for operational management services (PSC D318) in support of its Tier 1 Enterprise Hosting Environment, in addition to the Tier 2 through 4 hosting environments already within scope of the contract.  The contract action described below may be solicited and awarded without full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1).<br /><br />N00039-15-D-0044 was awarded on July 29, 2015 to Leidos, Inc. after a full and open competition.  The total award ceiling was $4,336,822,777 across a potential 10-year ordering period, if all optional ordering periods are exercised and award terms are earned.  The contractor is providing an off-the-shelf (OTS) electronic health record (EHR) system for deployment across the Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise.  Leidos, the prime contractor, serves as the service provider-integrator (SPI). <br /><br />MHS GENESIS consists of inpatient and outpatient solutions from Cerner and a dental solution provided by Henry Schein.  MHS GENESIS will replace functionality of core legacy systems (AHLTA, CHCS, and Essentris, among others), and will be deployed to both fixed medical treatment facilities and operational medicine facilities all over the world.  The Leidos Partnership is supporting the integration, configuration, testing, deployment, training, and sustainment of MHS GENESIS.<br /><br />On 18 DEC 2015 in synopsis number N00039_SNOTE_000C62BA, the Government announced its intent to add Tier 1 hosting to the DHMSM contract with Leidos.  Following this notice, the Government executed a Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) on 29 JAN 2016 to add Tier 1 hosting scope to the DHMSM contract and modified the contract accordingly.  The Government's analysis of the Tier 1 hosting solution determined that the cost would exceed the estimate in the original J&amp;A; accordingly, the Government amended the J&amp;A to reflect the new dollar values, although the overall award ceiling of $4,336,822,777 remained unchanged.  The amendment also limited the time period of the J&amp;A to the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) phase of the DHMSM contract to allow the Government the opportunity to leverage potential future market changes that may enhance the competitive environment for the hosting services.<br /><br />On 10 OCT 2017, the DHA assumed all contracting responsibilities for the DHMSM contract from the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command.<br /><br />On 23 OCT 2017, MHS GENESIS went live at its final IOC site, Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC).  This "Go Live" was later than expected, and because MAMC is the largest IOC facility, and the first to practice in many of the medical specialties, the Government has been unable to fully analyze the system or finalize its IOC technical solution, which will be achieved before the Full Deployment Decision (FDD).  Over the coming months, MHS GENESIS will continue to undergo independent operational testing in support of obtaining its FDD, which will formally end the IOC phase of the Program.  In addition, the DHMSM Program Office will continue to monitor and assess the technical performance of the solution, finalize clinical configurations, and solidify the solution baseline that it will deploy during Full Deployment.  Because of the IOC deployment delays, these activities will not be complete until after the current hosting services expire.  As a result, the Government intends to issue a new J&amp;A to provide continuity for the hosting services, without which the Government cannot operate the MHS GENESIS system.<br /><br />The scope being added under this modification will allow for the ordering of operational management services for three additional contract years, to include Tier 1 hosting, on the existing DHMSM IDIQ contract.  The total ordering ceiling and the period of performance of IDIQ contract N00039-15-D-0044 will also remain unchanged. <br /><br />For this time period, the Leidos Partnership for Defense Health remains the only source for the required services.  The Government would be unable to finalize its technical requirement, and, if satisfying the Government's hosting requirement in another datacenter is determined to be technically feasible, would not be able to 1) compete a contract action, 2) allow for the provisioning of the new datacenter, 3) completion of cybersecurity Certification &amp; Accreditation (C&amp;A) requirements, and 4) transition of the system to a new datacenter, prior to the end of the three-year period without significantly jeopardizing the stability and functionality of the system.<br /><br />Please note that if the Government at some point determines that competition of follow-on services is possible, the Government will seek to allow for the appropriate time to compete a solution and allow for overlap between contracts to successfully transition between environments.  As a result, follow-on contracting actions may occur prior to the end of this three-year period contemplated by this notice.  Please continue to monitor FedBizOpps for updates about the DHMSM contract requirements.<br /><br />Currently, some MHS GENESIS capabilities cannot be fully realized unless they are hosted in the Cerner environment.  In order to fully enable these functionalities, MHS GENESIS requires direct access to proprietary Cerner data, which is only available within the two (2) Cerner-owned and operated datacenters at this time.  The proprietary data consists of quantitative models and strategies which are the result of extensive Cerner-funded research and development efforts conducted over 15 years.  The models are based on analysis of clinical, operational, and financial data associated and incorporate vast amounts of actual longitudinal patient data and information collected through other Cerner applications.  Forward deploying MHS GENESIS into any other hosting solution would prevent access to these models and data.  Significant functionality exists within the required system that utilizes machine learning and computational statistics to enable predictive analysis and decision support that directly impact patient outcomes.<br /><br />In order to support its analysis and to assist in ascertaining what hosting options are available to potentially meet its EHR hosting requirement, the Government requests that any responses to this synopsis include any potential solutions for providing secure direct access to the proprietary Cerner data necessary to fully enable the capabilities of MHS GENESIS with high levels of performance in a Citrix environment.  Further, the Government is requesting any information about timelines to 1) provisioning a new datacenter, 2) completion of cybersecurity C&amp;A requirements, and 3) transition of the system to a new datacenter.  Any solutions that do not clearly address and demonstrate the ability to fully satisfy these requirements will be considered non-responsive.<br /><br />Be advised that the aforementioned information is anticipatory in nature and is not binding.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm believing that they can fulfill the requirement of providing these services may be considered by the Agency.  Interested parties shall identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis within 15 calendar days of publication, and must clearly demonstrate their ability to successfully fulfill all of the above requirements, including written permission from Cerner to connect to its proprietary data.  The Government reserves the right not to respond to any expressions of interest received.<br /><br />Any comments, questions, or concerns regarding this notice may be submitted IN WRITING via e-mail to Matthew Hudson, Contracting Officer at matthew.g.hudson2.civ@mail.mil.  No telephone responses will be accepted.<br /><br />Submissions will NOT be reimbursed by the Government and the entire cost of any submission will be at the sole expense of the source submitting the information.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only.  Any Justification &amp; Approval resulting from a decision to award the proposed sole source action will be posted on this website.<br /><br />All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Submissions will not be returned nor will the Government confirm receipt of submissions.<br /><br />In addition, respondents should be aware that the DHMSM Program Office may utilize contractor support personnel from the below listed companies (under existing contracts) to review responses and information submitted.  These companies and individual employees are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information, and they will take all reasonable action necessary to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of a respondent's proprietary data.  Submissions MUST clearly state whether permission is granted allowing the program office support contractors identified below access to any proprietary information:

<SUBJECT>Utilizing Public-Private Partnerships to Advance Tipping Point Technologies  Synopsis
<SOLNBR>80HQTR18NOA01-18STMD_001
<CONTACT>Bonnie James, Senior Investment Strategist, STMD, Email HQ-STMD-TippingPointAppendix@nasaprs.com
<DESC><br />The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters anticipates a release of a solicitation, entitled "Utilizing Public-Private Partnerships to Advance Tipping Point Technologies" as an Appendix to the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) umbrella NASA Research Announcement (NRA), titled "Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion - 2018 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2018)," on or about November 30, 2017. Once the Appendix is posted, complete <br />details (to include due dates) can be accessed via the following steps:<br /><br />
<p>1.  Open the NSPIRES homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ <br />2.  Select "Solicitations" <br />3.  Select "Open Solicitations" <br />4.  Select "Utilizing Public-Private Partnerships to Advance Tipping Point Technologies 80HQTR18NOA01-18STMD_001" <br /> <br />The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) continues to embrace public-private partnerships to achieve its strategic goals for expanding capabilities and opportunities in space. A key aspect of NASA's strategy is to stimulate the commercial space industry and commercial capabilities through public-private partnerships to deliver technologies and capabilities needed for future NASA, other government agency, and commercial missions. With the recent increase of U.S. private sector companies interested in space applications, NASA is seeking commercial space technologies that are at a "tipping point" in their development cycle.  The anticipated definition to be used for the purpose of this Appendix is that a space technology is at a "tipping point" if:<br /><br />&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>an investment in a ground demonstration or flight demonstration will result in:<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>o	a significant advancement of the technology's maturation, and<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>o	a significant improvement in the offerors' ability to successfully bring the space <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>&nbsp; &nbsp;technology to market, and<br />&bull;	<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>there is clear evidence of previous investments in maturing the technology (e.g., <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>venture capital, corporate investment, etc.) indicating a pre-existing plan to <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>commercialize the technology, and<br />&bull;	<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>the technology is at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 4 at time of <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>proposal submission.</p>
<p>This Appendix is seeking U.S. for-profit industry led proposals to advance "tipping point" space technologies, executed through firm-fixed-price contracts with milestone payments. See Appendix section 3.0 for the full list of eligibility requirements/restrictions. The award instrument will be a firm-fixed-price contract with milestone payments tied to technical achievement.</p>
<p>This release will solicit tipping point technologies from broader technology thrust areas. This release will also utilize a two-step proposal submission and evaluation process. The initial step will be a short mandatory preliminary proposal. Those offerors submitting the most competitive mandatory preliminary proposals will be invited to submit a full proposal.</p>
<p>All proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES by an authorized organizational representative (AOR). Detailed submission instructions are provided in the SpaceTech-REDDI-2018 NRA and the Appendix. Potential proposers and their proposing organizations are urged to familiarize themselves with the submission system, ensure they are registered in NSPIRES, and submit the required proposal materials well in advance of the deadline.</p>
<p>All questions and comments must be submitted in writing to HQ-STMD-TippingPointAppendix@nasaprs.com by January 16, 2018.&nbsp; Responses to inquiries will be answered by email and may also be included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document located on the NSPIRES page associated with the Appendix; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.</p>
<p>The Appendix and any documents related to this procurement will be available by opening the NSPIRES homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ by selecting "Solicitations," then selecting "Open Solicitations," and, finally selecting "Utilizing Public-Private Partnerships to Advance Tipping Point Technologies."</p>
<p>It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the Appendix and amendments (if any).</p>

<DESC>NSN 1H-6140-014685954, TDP VER 004, REF NR B059, QTY 968 EA, DELIVERY FOB ORIGIN. The approved source is Lockheed Martin, cage 52088. ITEMS TO BE INCLUDED ON THIS SOLICITATION ARE AS FOLLOWS: CLIN NIIN NAME PN CLIN1 014685954 Battery Assembly B059 Lockheed Martin is the design agent, system integrator and the NAVSEA approved source of supply and certified depot for the AN/UYQ-70(V) weapon system. NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator. The integrator has the necessary operational, design, configuration management, integration and engineering knowledge when purchasing, building and repairing Q-70 parts for hosted systems. ***SOURCE APPROVAL*** LOCKHEED MARTIN IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY FOR THESE ITEMS. LOCKHEED MARTIN IS THE DESIGN AGENT, SYSTEM INTEGRATOR AND THE NAVSEA APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND CERTIFIED DEPOT FOR THE AN/UYQ-70(V) WEAPON SYSTEM.

<RESPDATE>112417
<ARCHDATE>11242017
<CONTACT>Pavlo Olenchyk 2156974960
<DESC>The NAVSUP Weapon System Support plans to award a five year Performance Based Logistics contract for AV-8B components listed below with Safran Landing Systems (Cage Code K0654) in Gloucester, UK in December 2018.  Under the proposed contract, the contractor will stock, warehouse, repair, modify and/or replace, store and provide for shipment Ready-for-Issue (RFI) condition assets within negotiated supply response times.  The PBL contract will require an integrated product life cycle approach whereby the contractor assumes responsibility for many management and support functions related to the PBL such as engineering and logistics support. Safran Landing Systems will be required to meet established supply response times through WRA/LRU repair and replacement, reliability oversight, and inventory, configuration and obsolescence management.

The contractor will be required to partner with organic depot FRC-E (Cherry Point) and to renew and/or execute new Commercial Services Agreements.

The maximum period of performance for this effort will not exceed 7 years.
 Justification for Sole Source Acquisition: the statutory authority applicable to permit other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) with only responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements. Safran Landing Systems, Cage Code K0654, is the OEM for the Navy AV-8B components to be covered under this PBL contract. Currently, the only approved source of supply for the 57 subject items, per JDRS and/or drawings located in JEDMICS is SAFRAN LANDING SYSTEMS UK LTD (K0654).

The 57 subject items are either Critical Safety Items (CSI) and/or the criticality has not yet been entered into JDRS. The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
 All alternate sources must qualify IAW the design control activitys procedures, as approved by NAVAIR prior to contract award. Data review discloses that all data including manuals, publications, associated drawings and specifications required to manufacture the 57 subject items are not in the Governments possession and cannot be economically obtained.

Even though the requirement has been designated sole source, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. For any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, Pavlo Olenchyk at pavlo.olenchyk@navy.mil.

Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.
 The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source, you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/site/public/wss/documents/business_opps/main/sar_aviation_repairs.pdf. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
 Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  

Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.  

Subcontracting Opportunities: All businesses interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Safran Landing Systems.

This is a Notice of Intent published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(1) requiring the dissemination of information regarding proposed contract actions. This Notice of Intent is for a proposed award of a sole source, firm-fixed price contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b) - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Service Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. It is not a request for competitive quotes.
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 23 intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract to Roche Diagnostics Corp. for scheduled maintenance and support services. VA requires the proprietary software licenses from Roche Diagnostics Corp. in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b) - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Service Will Satisfy Agency Requirements because the maintenance and software services are unique or proprietary to Roche Diagnostics Corp. Market research revealed that Roche Diagnostics Corp is the proprietary developer and distributor for the software system and maintenance currently being utilized by VA. Additionally, Roche Diagnostics Corp is the only manufacturer that can provide the required maintenance support for the software licenses. The software system is routinely used by VA to perform laboratory analysis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 339112 and the service code is J066. 
While this synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the requirement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The Government understands that Roche Diagnostics Corp is the only vendor that can provide the requested software and maintenance. However, vendors that believe they can provide the capabilities required to fully meet the Government's requirement may submit information in writing to mark.thyne@va.gov prior to 11/15/2017. Such documentation will be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct the procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Steven R. Selm, Phone 9372552635, Email steven.selm@us.af.mil
<DESC><p>***See attached document for full details regarding this notice*** <br /><br />This is an SSS/RFI only in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p>For the F-16 Mission Training Center, the Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise and capabilities to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide operations, maintenance, and sustainment (OM&amp;S) support including: Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), Training System Support Center (TSSC) services to include modifications/upgrades and Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) support and testing, database development, and site visits for a period of up to fifteen (15) months and three (3) days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The F-16 MTC is a 4-ship high fidelity training center, providing training for Block 40/42 and Block 50/52 aircrew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each MTC is a DMO Federate System that can interoperate with other geographically separated DMO Federate Systems, as part of a DMO Federation linked by the DMO Network (DMON), to enable real-time combat team training during scheduled DMO events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This drives the requirement for Joint Special Access Program Implementation Guide (JSIG) Risk Management Framework (RMF) cybersecurity and enhanced security requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, there is a requirement for Nellis Mission Operations Network (<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: ">NMON) connectivity for the MTC which drives a requirement for Top Secret/SCI operations at Nellis.<br /><br /><br />The Government is currently contemplating the acquisition strategy for the F-16 Simulator Training Program (STP) re-compete action, which includes the F-16 MTC program, and this sources sought synopsis serves as market research to identify support services which may be available following the conclusion of the existing F-16 MTC contract on 28 December 2018 until the F-16 STP contract award and transition is complete. Results of the market research will determine the approach for interim continued support.<br /><br />For this acquisition, potential sources must be able to design, develop, implement, test, install, and manage required hardware/software upgrades for the F-16 MTC.&nbsp; During the first twelve (12) months of the 15 month 3 day period, the existing F-16 MTC Contractor will be simultaneously completing development and fielding on the M7.2+ Operational Flight Program (OFP) upgrade for the F-16 MTCs; therefore, the Contractor will be required to work with existing F-16 MTC contractor in maintaining the hardware and software technical baseline.<br /><br />The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15 contract. Potential sources must have the required personnel available with the required Special Access Program (SAP) clearances and a Defense Security Services (DSS) accredited facility with physical security at the Secret SAP level available for the F-16 MTC TSSC to start work in the 1st Quarter of Calendar Year 2019. The CLS technicians at Nellis AFB will require a TS/SCI clearance.<br /><br />The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the FAR.&nbsp; Companies responding to this sources sought are advised that participation does not ensure involvement in future solicitations or contract awards.&nbsp; The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this SSS/RFI.&nbsp; Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS/RFI.</span></p>
<p>Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this SSS/RFI, your response will be treated as information only.&nbsp; It will not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined.&nbsp; Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>Formal responses should be e-mailed to steven.selm@us.af.mil and michael.swanger.1@us.af.mil.&nbsp; REQUEST RESPONSES NLT COB 01 December 2017.&nbsp; Also, please mail an original signed copy of your response, postmarked on or before the same date, to:</p>

<p>The results of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement, if a requirement materializes. Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition. Multiple awards may be made. All small business set-aside categories will be considered. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding submissions.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) TO BE SUBMITTED. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The M1116 cartridge will augment the currently fielded M1012, which has an effective range of 10 to 20 meters (m). The extended range (30 to 50 m) of the M1116 cartridge provides field commanders and soldiers with an enhanced capability, increasing their flexibility with a blunt force trauma that contains a marking effect to target individuals for future identification. The cartridges are intended to be direct fire, low hazard, non-shrapnel producing devices that provides a less than lethal marking effect upon impact. When employed from 12 gauge weapon systems, the cartridges produce non-explosive and less than lethal force to confuse, disorient, or deter the targeted individual without causing catastrophic injuries. The M1116 increases the safe standoff distance between supported units and targets while simultaneously minimizing civilian casualties and collateral damage of people, materiel, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>The Government requires the manufacture, inspection, testing, and delivery of the Cartridge, 12-Gauge Non-Lethal Extended Range Point; M1116 in accordance with the performance specification, MIL-PRF-32527. The intent of this Sources Sought is to assess the state-of-the art of the technology available in non-lethal extended range products that could be applied to meet this requirement for low-rate production.</p>
<p>The Government envisions a solution for Cartridge, 12-Gauge: Non-Lethal Extended Range Point; M1116 that meets the following operational and program requirements and is ready for low rate production:</p>

The mark must cover an area of at least 2 in2 regardless of shape and be non-red or non-orange in color.<br />2) Must have an effective engagement range of 30 - 50 meters (threshold) and 10 - 75 meters (objective).<br />3) Must have a probability of hit P(h) equal to or greater than 0.5 from 30 - 50 meters (Threshold (T)) and 0.5 from 10 - 75 meters (Objective (O)) when fired from the Mossberg Model 500 or the Modular Accessory Shotgun System (MASS), M26.<br />4) Must have a reliability equal to or greater than .94 (T) and .98 (O). <br />5) Must comply with standard 12-gauge military packaging for shipping,<br />6) Ability to withstand operating temperatures ranging from 0&deg;F to 140&deg;F. <br />7) Be able to provide documentation on any analysis conducted on the cartridge (i.e. Human Effects Center of Excellence (HECoE) Advanced Total Body Model report and/or Risk of Significant Injury report).<br />8) Be able to provide impact energy and impact energy densities for the cartridge for the engagement ranges listed above.</p>
<p>Respondents should address the following:</p>
<p>a) A brief summary of the capabilities, description of facilities, and relative experience in manufacturing and testing 12 gauge munitions. <br />b) Monthly production rate and/or potential forecasted production capacity.<br />c) Identification of any key suppliers that would be utilized in the manufacturing of the M1116 cartridge (both military and/or non-military).<br />d) Ability to acquire facilities with sufficient safety clearance to handle, store, and transport energetic materials.<br />e) A corporate point of contact, phone number, email address, and website (if available).<br />f) Identification of business size (and any socio-economic considerations), 2017 NAICS code, cage code, and DUNS number. <br />g) Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) production (unit) cost. Please provide any information with regard to quantity price breaks.</p>
<p>Qualification.</p>

The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this SS, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. This SS does not constitute a commitment by the Government. Any information provided in response to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.

The purpose of this SS is to conduct Market Research to determine an acquisition strategy for the establishment of Ventana Reagents for an IDIQ base year plus four (4) option years contract. 

Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service(PLMS) needs to procure reagents and consumables for the Ventana Bench Mark Ultra and Ventana Special Stain analyzer currently used at the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center (CLE VAMC), PLMS.

Only cartridges manufactured by Ventana will work with this analyzer.   It is proprietary in nature and the configuration is such that only a specific cartridge will fit into the analyzer.  
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 10, is conducting market research to determine if there are any Large Businesses and if there are a sufficient number of Small Businesses capable of performing the requirements to warrant a set-aside. The proposed solicitation is to furnish all materials, labor, equipment and transportation required to provide supplies to the CLE VAMC.

<DESC>A Market Survey is being conducted to determine if there are a reasonable number of interested small businesses to set this future project aside for them.  If your firm is a certified HUBZONE, 8A, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, or Woman Owned Business and you are interested in this project please respond appropriately. The planned project is for Seed Propagation Services for Bryce Canyon National Park. Contract term is anticipated to be a base year plus four option years.  All interested certified HUBZONE, 8A, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, or Women Owned Business contractors should respond to this survey by email NLT 20 November 2017, 5:00 pm, Mountain Time.  

The National Park Service (NPS) requires park sourced plant materials to accomplish its policies to protect the full range of genetic types of native plant and animal populations (NPS Management Policies 2006 Section 4.4.1.2). To fulfill this policy NPS intends to procure wildland seed from seed increase fields and plant propagation services specific to higher elevations, a minimum of 6,000 to provide similar habitat of the plant materials origin.  NPS is seeking native plant production companies located at high elevation, with sufficient land to provide isolation distances of locally collected species.  Native plant production companies must have the capability of ensuring preservation of park native plant germplasm, and the capability to obtain source identified seed certification from a state agency. Staff must have a specialty knowledge related to the native species of National Parks such as Bryce Canyon and Colorado Monument and how to address some of the dormancy issues associated with local accessions of native plant materials.  The servicing company will be required to have seed storage facilities which ensure less than 40 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures and less than 40% humidity.   An example of species grown at 6,000 feet or above include:   Erysimum asperum, Packera multilobata, Muhlenbergia montana, Bouteloua gracilis, Hedysarum boreale, and Leymus salinus.



Responses should include: 
(1) Identification and verification of the companys small business status. 
(2)  Descriptions of Experience - provide descriptions of services provided that are complete or substantially complete within the last five years which are similar to Seed Propagation in size and scope to that described above. With each project experience provided, include the date when the project was completed or will be complete, location of the project, contract amount and the portion and percentage of work that was self-performed. 
(3) A statement of the portion of the work that will be self-performed on this project, and how it will be accomplished.  

Please only include a narrative of the requested information; addition information will not be reviewed. Send responses to Julie_Newland@nps.gov.  This is NOT a request for quote or proposals. 

To compete for upcoming contract solicitations with the National Park Service, your business must be actively registered at www.sam.gov

STATEMENT OF WORK

1. Description of Services:  The Contractor shall provide all management, licenses, laboratory testing, tools, supplies, equipment, transportation and labor to develop and implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) plan at the James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago, IL and its Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in Evanston, IL, McHenry, IL and Kenosha, WI in a manner that will ensure the health and general well-being of patients, staff, and visitors.  Services at the CBOCs are only to remedy those insects brought in by patients and include, but are not limited to: Bedbugs, Scabies, Lice, Roaches, Fleas, etc., on an individual on-call basis.  IPM for the CBOC buildings is the responsibility of the Building Manager.  IPM is a process for achieving long term, environmentally sound pest suppression through the use of a wide variety of technological and management practices.  Control strategies in an IPM Program extend beyond the application of pesticides to include structural and procedural modifications that reduce the food, water, harborage, and access used by pests.  The following types of pests are common on this campus, and their abatement should be specifically addressed in the IPM and used to determine workload:

ANTS, ARACHNIDS, ROACHES, BEDBUGS, WATERBUGS, SILVERFISH, BEETLES, FLEAS, MOSQUITOES, CHIGGERS, FLIES, MOTHS, SCABIES, LICE OR OTHER INSECTS: MICE, GOPHERS, RACCOON, FOX, RATS, SKUNKS AND OTHER RODENTS, ALL BIRDS AND WATERFOWL.

Contractor shall also be responsible for the control of pigeons.  This control may entail the use of traps/cages and live bait.  Cages must be equipped with adequate food and water to sustain entrapped pigeons until removal by the Contractor.  Removal shall occur at frequent intervals and the number of pigeons removed shall be reported to the Contracting Officer s Representative (COR).  Contractor will insure that they obtain appropriate Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) permit for the destruction of Canada goose nests and eggs.  

It shall be the Contractor s responsibility to remove and properly dispose of bee and wasp nests, and all birds and animals trapped/caught within the property of North Chicago FHCC.

1.1     Basic Services:  The contractor shall develop an IPM plan for approval.  The IPM plan will require approval by the Contractor s Technical Representative, COR prior to implementation and is subject to the COR and Contracting Officer s (CO) approval.  The Contractor s IPM plan shall establish the strategy and methods for conducting a safe, effective, and environmentally sound pest management program.  Prospective contractors may review the installation s historical records of pest activity and abatement actions, and survey facilities and grounds in order to develop a pest management plan.  In developing the IPM plan, the contractor should address continuous monitoring, pest response and removal procedures, record keeping, warranties, pest education and communication to hospital personnel to prevent pests and disease vectors, and to initiate bird control around the campus.  The IPM approach should use targeted methods including habitat/facility modification, biological/genetic/cultural control, mechanical/physical control, and where necessary, the judicious use of least hazardous pesticides.  The IPM plan shall comply with all applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and state/local regulatory guidance on pesticide storage, disposal and applications. Contractor shall submit their IPM plan for approval with the signed offer.   IPM services plan required of the contractor shall include, but not be limited to the following tasks:

<CONTACT>Matthew C. Ebner, Email matthew.c.ebner.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>This synopsis is to inform industry that the Government intends to modify contract W56KGY-16-D-0035 to increase the maximum contract ceiling from $305,738,346 by $233,334,787 to $539,073,133. The contract was awarded to Bravura Information Technology, Inc. on 01 August 2016 and provides engineering/technical, logistics, and operations support to the Persistent Surveillance Systems - Tethered. The Government intends to modify this contract pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements to the current prime contractor. Due to the nature of this work, the Government's mission cannot afford for a competition and potential transition to a new contractor. This action also supports the procurement of crucial spares in support to the Army's CENTCOM mission. Any disruption or break in service at this time will diminish battle space awareness necessary to prevent loss of life and serious injury for US and coalition forces in the U.S. Central Command. While other companies have the required expertise and experience, only the current contractor has the required resources in place and would not require any transition time to fulfill the Government's current immediate need.
<p>The Government projects to award this modification in December 2017. This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>Technology Call for the 2019 Maneuver Support, Sustainment, and Protection Integration Experiments (MSSPIX 19).
<p>1. Background. The MSSPIX campaign of experimentation follows the ARCIC Live Prototype Assessment (ALPA) guidance. ALPA provides a centralized management process for Army live prototype assessments, verifies data and recommendations generated from those assessments in order to identify specific capabilities that inform interim solutions to Capability Gaps, running estimates of Army Warfighter Challenges (AWFCs), Operational and Organizational (O&amp;O) Development and progression of Force 2025 Maneuver (F2025M) efforts.</p>
<p>2. Intent. In accordance with the ALPA FY18/19/20 Planning Guidance, the Maneuver Support Center of Excellence (MSCoE) and Sustainment Center of Excellence (SCoE) will host MSSPIX 2019 to examine DOTMLPF capabilities and concepts designed to address experiment objectives for Maneuver Support, Sustainment and Protection. Defeating capable enemies in the future requires Army maneuver forces enabled by Maneuver Support and Sustainment equities in all five domains - Land, Air, Cyberspace, Space and Maritime. Crossdomain maneuver is the employment of mutually supporting lethal and nonlethal capabilities in multiple domains to create a synergistic effect that increases relative combat power and provides Army forces with the overmatch necessary to destroy or defeat enemy forces.</p>
<p>3. Timeline. The milestones for MSSPIX 2019 Technology Selection are outlined below. All dates are projected and may shift.</p>
<p>a. 9 December 2017: Technology submissions due. (Some of the attachments reference a due date of 1 December 2017; the due date has been extended to 9 December 2017.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems and Design (NAWCTSD), Orlando will be hosting Industry Days starting November 28th and ending November 30th, 2017.  The topic will be Sailor 2025 (S2025).
 
The Sailor 2025 project is a transformational Navy training initiative that will accelerate the learning of every Sailor for faster response to our rapidly changing warfighting requirements, and achieve higher performance by coupling the timing of training delivery with every Sailors actual deck plate need. Ready, Relevant, Learning (RRL) creates a learning continuum across a Sailors career, from recruit to master chief that will ensure every Sailor has the latest training to support assigned task.
 RRL will modernize delivery methods from traditional brick-and-mortar schoolhouses to mobile, multi-media, multi-platform delivery solutions that leverage the best concepts to accelerate learning as individuals, teams and organizations. Finally, RRL will allow rapid infusion of relevant course content to accelerate the dissemination of critical warfighting knowledge to Sailors.

A slide presentation along with question and answer sessions will be held daily in Room S310C, at the I/ITSEC conference.   

We attached two separate DRAFT Statements of Work (SOW) for upcoming efforts associated with Wave 1 Content Conversion and Wave 3 Knowledge Capture.  These documents are being provided for open communication with industry.
  
Please review attached SOWs prior to attending the selected dates listed below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

(t) System for Award Management (SAM).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<BR><BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
(u) Unauthorized Obligations
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term EFT refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the SAM database.
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210.
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractors EFT information in the SAM database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractors EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.<BR><BR>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractors EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractors financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the SAM database.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 32.706-3, insert the following clause:

(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.
(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 33.106, insert the following provision:

<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov.

If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your proposal must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<DESC><p>1.  <strong>Solicitation</strong>. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.</p>
<p>The CA Army National Guard intends to utilize this Request for Quote (RFQ), under solicitation number W912LA-18-T-0011, to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract for the supplies to support the California Army National Guard Yellow Ribbon Program.  The government intends to award one contract to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the Best Value to the Government.</p>
<p>This document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95, Defense Acquisition Circular DPN 20161222, and Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement Revision #26.</p>
<p>See the attached CLIN Structure Price Sheet (Attachment 1) in accordance with FAR 12.603(c)(v).</p>
<p>This solicitation is 100% set aside for small business.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 721110.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $32.5 millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (July 2016) Alternate I (Oct 2014), or ensure the Representations and Certifications are updated at www.sam.gov.

Attachment 2 identifies the applicable clauses and provisions to this RFQ.  All clauses and provisions may be found in full text at the following site:  http://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>
<p>2.  <strong>Description of Requirement</strong>. The Government has a need to acquire conference space and amenities (i.e; breakfast, lunch, water) for informational meetings.  This requirement is for temporary use on a non-recurring basis.  The need is for no less than Four (3) rooms' total: One (1) general concession room to accommodate Four Hundred (500) attendees, comprised of single and family units. Two (1) general use rooms to accommodate Fifty (50) children and appropriate staff between the two rooms: One (1) Small Meeting space that can accommodate 5 people in San Diego, CA  95814 (10 mile radius) on 9th of December, 2017.</p>
<p>3.  <strong>Basis for Award</strong>. The Government intends to award without discussions one Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the acquisition of event space.  Award will be made to the lowest price responsible offeror that is determined to be technically acceptable.  The Government intends to select one contractor; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all.</p>
<p>Since award will be based on initial responses, offerors are highly encouraged to quote their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.  The responses to this RFQ are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions unless discussions are deemed to be necessary.</p>
<p>4.  <strong>Best Value Evaluation</strong>. For this procurement, the Best Value determination will be made as Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers:  A) Price, B) Technical, and C) Past Performance Factors.</p>
<p>A.  Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the price sheet by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN).  The TEP is a two-part computation.  First, the offeror's total proposed price will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Price Proposal Worksheet by the unit price, limited to two decimal places, for each CLIN to confirm the extended total amount for each CLIN; the sum of all extended amounts will be the offeror's total proposed price.  Second, the total proposed price will constitute the TEP.</p>
<p>B.  Technical and past performance factors will be evaluated by the ratings listed below.  The failure of an offeror to meet the requirements of a factor or subfactor will result in an unacceptable rating.  The technical, past performance, and subcontracting plan factors will receive one of the ratings listed below:  <br /> (1) Acceptable:  Quote clearly meets the requirements of the solicitation.<br /> (2) Unacceptable:  The quote does not clearly meet the requirements of the <br /> solicitation.</p>
<p>C.  Technical and Past Performance Factors:  The Government will evaluate the offers for being technically acceptable and for being rated acceptable or unacceptable for past performance, assigning the ratings as described in the paragraph above.  The failure of an offer to meet any or all of the technical criteria will result in a technically unacceptable rating and preclude award.  A rating of unacceptable for one or more technical subfactors will constitute an overall rating of unacceptable for the technical evaluation.</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical.  The Government will determine acceptability based on Contractor ability to provide adequate location and amenity requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance.  The Government will determine acceptability based on either Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) ratings, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) or from other sources (if necessary).  Past performance is determined by work completed within the past three (3) years.  Relevancy is based on providing event space support.  If an offeror has no recent or relevant past performance, past performance will be treated as neutral, resulting in an acceptable rating.</p>
<p>5.  <strong>Additional Instructions to Offerors</strong>.  Vendors shall respond to this RFQ via email by <strong>November 24, 2017 by 5:00 P.M. Pacific Standard Time (PST).</strong> All quotes should be sent to the Contract Specialist, Javier Duran at javier.v.duran.mil@mail.mil before the due date and time specified.  Any quote, modification, or revision of a quote received after the exact time specified for receipt of quotes is "late" and may not be considered.</p>
<p>All offers must list DUNS number, CAGE code, and Federal TIN with Company name, POC, and phone number.  To obtain or renew a DUNS number or CAGE code, please visit https://www.sam.gov.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an Offeror ineligible for award.</p>
<p>Vendor must also be registered in Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) to receive payment through electronic funds transfer.  If you are not currently registered, please visit the following website https://wawf.eb.mil/to complete your registration.</p>

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-91 effective 30 September 2016.  Solicitation is 100% Small Business Set-Aside and the associated NAICS code is 325120 and small business size standard is 1,000.
 Requirement as follows:

CLIN 0001 QTY 1 Lot Bulk Propane and Delivery Total Estimated Quantity of 42,400 gallons delivered at 6 Naval facilities located in California  see attached Requirements Description/Delivery Schedule.

Delivery/Period of Performance:  01DEC2017  30NOV2018; FOB Destination  various locations  see attachment

The FAR provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding any addenda to the provision.

52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)

(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

(i)	Technical capability of the item offered to meet the government requirement;

(ii)	Past performance; and

(iii)	Price

Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price.

Offerors proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  A will comply statement without accompanying technical specifications and/or drawings of product being offered is automatic failure under this factor.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and may be removed from further competition.
  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those Offers that are rated acceptable in Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii), and (iii).  Contract will be awarded to the offeror who is found acceptable in Factors (i) and
(ii) and is the lowest price offer.
 
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.

(b)	Technical capability of the item offered to meet the government requirement. This factor has following sub-factors as follows:

1)	Licensed propane dealer in California
2)	Delivery Schedule to include statement of being able to deliver propane within 24 hours of order during emergency conditions;

Quote shall include a statement confirming compliance with subfactors 1) and 2) above to receive rating of acceptable in Factor (i).
  It is in the discretion of the Contracting Officer to decide whether to accept as acceptable proposed later delivery schedule  i.e. more than 24 hours during emergencies if only one quote is received.

(c)	Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. Offers that lack relevant past performance history, will receive a neutral rating under this factor.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
 Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.  Neutral rating will be rated as acceptable.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offerors past performance.  Satisfactory rating will be rated as acceptable.

UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offerors past performance.
Unsatisfactory rating will be rated unacceptable.

(d)	Price quote.

(1)	Bulk propane pricing shall include the following:

-	Pricing summary using Table 1 format from attachment;
-	Offeror shall include the pricing formula/methodology used in its quoted price to include the propane index (or market indicator), markup, and current IFF rate used - see below.

(2)	Total Price will be the sum of all prices under Extended Price column and will be the evaluated price.
 
(3)	The Pricing formula will be incorporated in the resulting contract and shall be used as basis for requesting for Economic Price Adjustment (see FAR 52.216-2).

(4)	A single-award Fixed Price contract with Economic Price Adjustment will be awarded to the quote that received ratings of acceptable in Factors (i) and (ii) and is the lowest evaluated price.

(e)	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
 Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected.

Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The COR will assume a quality performance rating of "Green" on all measured deliverables unless otherwise notified. <br />The quality rating may change from "Green" to "Red" without notice. We anticipate the COR utilizing the "Yellow" quality rating to alert the contracting office and the COR of quality issues that have the potential for a "Red" quality rating if corrective action is not taken.<br />By approving service and/or deliverables on the worksheet, the COR confirms the quality performance rating of "Green" unless otherwise annotated. The Contracting Officer listed in the contract will provide the Contractor with a copy of all rating worksheets that are other than green.<br />At the end of the performance period, the COR will be asked to complete a Quality Performance Review to document the quality performance rating. This will be submitted to the Contracting Officer. If there are any ratings other than green a copy will be furnished to the contractor. <br />The COR may submit a Quality Assurance Worksheet at anytime and as often as necessary to document quality levels. If Contractor response to an identified quality deficiency is unsatisfactory, the Contracting Officer will contact the appropriate Contractor representative to implement a plan of action to remedy the identified deficiency.</p>

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule; or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the initial contract prices, or, if it is established, the redetermined prices of this contract, as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement.

Evaluation Process: 
Award shall be made to the best value, as determined to be the most beneficial to the Government.  Please read each section below carefully for the submittals and information required as part of the evaluation.  Failure to provide the requested information below shall be considered non-compliant and your quote could be removed from the evaluation process.
Offeror quotes shall be evaluated under FAR Part 13.106-2(b) -- Evaluation of Quotations or Offers.  Therefore, the Government is not obligated to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions with all contractors, solicit final revised quotes, and use other techniques associated with FAR Part 15.  The contracting techniques associated with FAR Part 15 are not mandatory.
The Government shall award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation shall be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 
Cascading Set-Aside Strategy:
The evaluation of offers received in response to the solicitation will use a tiered or cascading order of precedence.  Tiered evaluation of offers,  also known as  cascading evaluation of offers,  is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when market research is inconclusive for justifying limiting competition to small business concerns or sub-categories of small business concerns. The contracting officer  
(1) Solicits offers from both small and other than small business concerns that will be evaluated in the following tier order: 
(a) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB); 
(b) veteran-owned small business (VOSB); 
(c) all other small business concerns; 
(d) other than small business. 
(2) If an award or a sufficient number of awards cannot be made at the first tier, evaluation of offers will proceed at the next lower tier until an award or a sufficient number of awards can be made.
The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Price (Follow these instructions):
Offeror shall complete the above Price Schedule, with offerors proposed contract line item prices inserted in appropriate spaces. Offerors must also provide all applicable labor rates for the solicited services so they can be compared to the applicable wage determination for compliance with the Service Contract Labor Standards.  
Ensure your representations and certifications are complete in the System for Award Management (SAM)( https://www.sam.gov).  Otherwise, you will need to fill out solicitation Clause 52.212-3 "Offeror Representation and Certifications -Commercial Items", and submit with the quote.   Federal Acquisition Regulations require that federal contractors register in the SAM database at http://www.sam.gov and enter all mandatory information into the system. Award cannot be made until the contractor has registered. Offerors are encouraged to ensure that they are registered in SAM prior to submitting their quotation.
Past Performance:
Provide (3) references of work, similar in scope and size with the requirement detailed in the Statement of Work.  References must include contact information; brief description of the work completed, and contract # (if relevant). Please utilize Attachment 1   Past Performance Worksheet for your references and please submit as part of your quote submission.  References may be checked by the Contracting Officer to ensure your company is capable of performing the Statement of Work. The Government also reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources. 
Technical: The offeror s quote shall be evaluated to determine if the organization has the experience and capabilities to provide the requested services in accordance with the SOW in a timely efficient manner.
Contractor shall demonstrate their corporate experience and approach to meet all requirements stated in the SOW.
Contractor shall demonstrate that their technicians meet the qualification standards stated in the SOW.
Contractor shall provide a quality control plan, which explains the offerors approach to quality control and methodologies.   An example quality assurance surveillance plan is attached, see Attachment 2   QASP and can be utilized as a template.
Contractor shall provide all current and relevant licenses and/or certifications for the State of Vermont. 
If you are planning to sub-contract some or all of this work, please provide the name and address(s) of all subcontractor(s) (if applicable) and a description of their planned subcontracting effort.

Veterans Preference Factor (per 852.215-70): The Government shall assign evaluation credit for an Offeror (prime contractor) which is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVOSB) or a Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB). Non-SDVOSB/VOSB Offerors proposing to use SDVOSBs or VOSBs as subcontractors will receive some consideration under this evaluation Factor. 
For SDVOSBS/VOSBs: In order to receive credit under this Factor, an Offeror shall submit a statement of compliance that it qualifies as a SDVOSB or VOSB in accordance with VAAR 852.215-70,  Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors . Offerors are cautioned that they must be registered and verified in Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database (http://www.VetBiz.gov). 
Verified SDVOSBs will receive a 10% price credit (e.g. if a SDVOSB submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $90.00).
Verified VOSBs will received a 5% price credit (e.g. if a VOSB submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $95.00).
For Non-SDVOSBs/VOSBs: To receive some consideration under this Factor, an Offeror must state in its proposal the names of SDVOSB(s) and/or VOSB(s) with whom it intends to subcontract, and provide a brief description and the approximate dollar values of the proposed subcontracts. Additionally, proposed SDVOSB/VOSB Subcontractors must be registered and verified in VIP database (http://www.VetBiz.gov) in order to receive some consideration under the Veteran s Involvement Factor.

If a vendor submits a subcontracting plan where it will be using a SDVOSB, it will receive a 3.5% price credit (e.g. if this vendor submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $96.50).
If a vendor submits a subcontracting plan where it will be using a VOSB, it will receive a 2.5% price credit (e.g. if this vendor submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $97.50).

<DESC><p><br />UPDATE: We previously published that Mr. John Lyle, Deputy Commanding General, Army Contracting Command, would attend our ACC-ORL PALT session on 14 November 2017. Unfortunately, due to mission requirements, Mr. Lyle has to defer his visit to a future ACC-ORL PALT session. We will keep you apprised of when that will occur. We will still conduct our ACC-ORL PALT session this Tuesday, 14 November 2017 from 0900-1000 in Partnership III, Room 321, 3039 Technology Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Industry Stakeholders,</p>
<p>In response to Industry's continued requests to improve communication between Army Contracting Command-Orlando (ACC-ORL), PEO STRI, and Industry stakeholders, the ACC-ORL Executive Director/Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC), Mr. Joseph A. Giunta, Jr., will continue hosting monthly Procurement Administrative Lead Time (PALT) update sessions open to Industry participants intending to pursue contracts and/or business with the U.S. Government. For planning purposes, the remaining CY 2017 dates are as follows:</p>
<p><br />Remaining CY 2017 Session Dates:</p>
<p>14 November 2017<br />No session in December 2017</p>
<p><br />All sessions will be held in the following location:</p>
<p>Partnership III Building, Conference Room 321, 0900-1000 <br />3039 Technology Parkway <br />Orlando, FL 32826</p>
<p>RSVP: Not required. However, attendees must furnish I.D. and sign in before entering the session.</p>
<p><br />Each PALT update session will provide Industry the opportunity to request updates on specific procurements of interest in a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) type forum. There will not be a formal agenda, but rather an open Q&amp;A session not to exceed 60 minutes. It will be up to Industry representatives to request an update on specific procurements of interest. Information to be provided by the Government will be limited to status updates pertaining to specific procurements. The Government will not provide any procurement sensitive information that would violate the integrity of the source selection process.</p>
<p>Although minutes/notes for each session will not be provided, a document library has been created on the ACC-ORL Business Opportunities Portal (a.k.a. STRIBOP) for posting of miscellaneous briefings/presentations that may be provided during the PALT update sessions. These presentations can be accessed via the following link:</p>
<p>https://bop.peostri.army.mil/sites/bop/PALT%20Update%20Session%20Briefings/Forms/AllItems.aspx</p>
<p>Briefings will be posted to the document library within 3 business days after the applicable session.</p>
<p><br />IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PARKING: Due to limited parking in the Partnership II/III parking lot, all visitors MUST park in the large parking lot on the corner of Science Drive and Technology Parkway. The Partnership II/III parking lot is authorized parking for occupants only. Also, DO NOT PARK IN THE AT&amp;T PARKING LOT AS YOUR CAR WILL BE SUBJECT TO BEING TOWED.</p>

This status update is for informational and planning purposes only. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract or an order on the basis of this notice or to pay for the information solicited.
<p><strong>Update - Acquisition Strategy (tentative until published as part of a final Request for Proposal (RFP)): </strong>Consistent with the information presented during the 20 July Industry Day, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) has evaluated a variety of acquisition approaches to satisfy its agency-wide IT requirements as defined in the July 17, 2017 Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) titled, "DTRA Agency-Wide Information Technology Support Services Base Contract". The purpose of this notice is to share the current acquisition strategy while the draft solicitations are being developed. <br /><br />DTRA anticipates separating the requirements identified within the July 17, 2017 Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) into two Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) vehicles. <br /><br />The first IDIQ is anticipated to be competitively awarded as a single award, small businesses set-aside (NAICS Code 541513). The scope of this single award IDIQ is defined within paragraph 4.1 (and all sub-paragraphs) of the Draft SOO. A revised SOO, specific to this effort, will be included when the Draft RFP is published. The Draft RFP will also include up to three Task Order Performance Work Statements (PWSs) that the government intends to award concurrently with the IDIQ award. DTRA anticipates releasing the Draft RFP for this portion of the acquisition for industry review and comment on or about November 17, 2017. <br /><br />The second IDIQ is structured as a multiple award IDIQ with task orders issued using Full and Open competition. The scope of this multiple award IDIQ is defined in paragraph 4.2 (and all sub-paragraphs) of the Draft SOO. A revised SOO will be included when the Draft RFP is published. The Draft RFP will also include up to three task order PWSs the government intends to award concurrently with the IDIQ. A Draft RFP for this portion of the effort will be released in first quarter Calendar Year 2018 and will be available for review and comment. <br /><br /><strong>At this time, the government is not planning another Industry Day for this requirement but will include instructions and timelines for questions and feedback with the release of each Draft RFP.</strong><br /><br />Requested Action: The government is seeking no action or response based on this announcement as the announcement is solely intended to update industry of the current status of planning associated with this acquisition effort.</p>

<DESC>11/09/2017: The interested Parties List has been updated for an additional 283 entries bringing the total lines to 633.

11/08/2017: The purpose of this revision is to provide Amendment #1 to SIR No. DTFAWA-18-R-00001. Redline and clean versions are attached. Changes to the SIR consist of including specific dates in paragraph 7 Milestone Schedules (Table 1) and clarifying information in paragraphs 9.3.4 and 9.3.5.

11/07/2017: The purpose of this revision is to make publicly available the first iteration (V1) of the UASIPP Interested Parties List. The list has been added as an attachment.

11/02/2017: On October 25, 2017 the President directed the establishment of the Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Pilot Program (UASIPP) to test further integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) in a select number of State, local, and tribal jurisdictions (this includes U.S. Territories and holdings).

This new pilot program encourages State, local, and tribal governments, in partnership with UAS operators and other private sector stakeholders, to conduct advanced operations safely and with public support in affected communities.  The Department Of Transportation (DOT), through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), is announcing in a Federal Register Notice establishment of the UAS Integration Pilot Program, and identifies this site (https://faaco.faa.gov) to obtain the specific instructions for requesting access to a designated portal for submitting an application (in form of a proposal) to be considered for participation in the program. 

The first formal step for considering participants is the issuance of a Screening Information Request (SIR). The SIR, referred to in other Government agencies as a Request For Proposal, or RFP, is the vehicle through which the FAA will request prospective applicants to submit specific information for evaluation.  Applicants must be State, local or tribal Governments to be considered for award. Government applicants may team with industry.
The specific instructions for requesting access to the application portal are contained in the attached SIR. Applicants are required to provide their Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number with their request for portal access. This SIR (and any future changes) will be available on the FAA Contract Opportunities Web Site (https://faaco.faa.gov).  Additional information about the SIR process including the time critical schedule (SIR Table 1) should be reviewed immediately. The schedule within the SIR will be updated with hard dates when the Federal Register Notice (FRN) is formally published. The FRN publish date is expected to be on or about November 8, 2017.

The FAAs common acquisition process for obtaining information, evaluating, and selecting Applicants is contained in the agencys Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The FAA will use the AMS as guidance in the SIR process for obtaining and evaluating information.  The ultimate selection for the UASIPP Lead Participants will be at the discretion, and order, of the Secretary of Transportation.

Applicants who have been selected by the Secretary will enter, under Other Transaction Authority, into Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) with the FAA.  Each MOA will set out the terms and conditions under which the respective participant conducts the pilot program. A sample MOA is provided as an attachment.

The FAA anticipates awards of five or more MOAs resulting from this Screening Information Request (SIR). The period of performance is anticipated to be for three (3) years.
The Government will not provide any funding for project performance.
Each applicant must submit a proposal in accordance with the instructions contained in the attached SIR. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the SIR.
To be considered for award, applicants must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) and not listed on the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).  Prospective applicants are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this solicitation will be published at http://faaco.faa.gov under the current announcements for the FAA Headquarters.   It is the prospective applicants' responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement.  
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the SIR, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement. Therefore any cost associated with responding to this announcement is solely at the respondents expense.

<SUBJECT>NASA: Spitzer Space Telescope Extended Operations Request for Information (RFI)
<SOLNBR>NNH18ZDA011L
<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<RESPDATE>120117
<CONTACT>Dr. Jeffrey J.E. Hayes, Program Executive, Astrophysics Division, Science Mission Directorate, Phone 202-358-0353, Email jeffrey.hayes-1@nasa.gov
<DESC><strong><br />SUMMARY</strong>
<p><br />The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is seeking information from parties who are interested in operating the Spitzer Space Telescope using non-NASA funding, including defining and executing a Spitzer science program, beyond the timeframe of the NASA-funded mission. The Astrophysics Division of SMD has committed support for Spitzer operations through March 2019. If no engineering impediments arise we expect that current Spitzer operations could continue through September 2019 and operations beyond September 2020 should be possible for the lowest data volume observing modes. The FY18 cost of Spitzer operations, without direct science data analysis funding for the Guest Observer (GO) program and Deep Space Network (DSN) support, is $14 million. Responses to this Request for Information are sought from all interested domestic parties.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The Spitzer Space Telescope was launched in 2003 as NASA's Great Observatory for infrared exploration of the Universe, and the prime mission was completed in mid-2009 after the exhaustion of the on-board cryogen. Since that time the observatory has operated with the two shortest wavelength arrays of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) at 3.6 and 4.5 &micro;m. IRAC performance continues to be excellent. As Spitzer progresses along its Earth trailing orbit the geometry between the observatory, the Sun, and the Earth changes in such a way that in order to point the body-fixed high-gain antenna for communications, the observatory has to orient to greater solar pitch angles. Ensuring safe and efficient operations under these conditions poses the main challenge to prolonged operations. While the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope's capabilities will exceed Spitzer's for most observing programs, Spitzer's demonstrated relative photometry precision, mapping speed and ability to make very long observations, interrupted only by downlinks every 24-48 hours, still provide unique capabilities for studies of exoplanets, extragalactic surveys and other science programs that benefit from its unique attributes.</p>
<p><strong>ASSUMPTIONS</strong></p>
<p>The following assumptions should be considered when providing a response to this RFI.<br /><br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>1.	The response must come from the lead institution, and the lead institution must <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>be US-based.<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>2.	Spitzer mission and spacecraft operations at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>and Lockheed Martin, and the scheduling portion of science operations at NASA's <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC) on the Caltech campus, cannot be <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>moved. The complexity and legacy nature of the operations hardware and <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>software preclude porting it to other institutions.<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3.	Scientific planning, the selection of the observations to be executed, and the <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>creation of Astronomical Observation Requests (AORs) for delivery to the IPAC <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>scheduling team can be carried out by other institutions.<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>4.	NASA will provide the required services of the Deep Space Network.<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>5.	In 2019 onwards it is expected that one downlink contact/day will be required <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>and the maximum duration will be ~2 hours. The observing modes that can be <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>supported beyond September 2019 would include 2-second sub-array and 100-<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>second or greater full-array observations.<br /><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>6.	All data acquired by any non-NASA-funded phase of the mission will be <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>delivered to the Infrared Science Archive at IPAC.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE GUIDELINES</strong></p>
<p>Responses should include the following items.<br />1.	Entity information: name, contact information, summary of previous relevant experience.<br />2.	Overview of the observing plan, including any science program.<br />3.	Description of the proposed operations concept.</p>
<p>Responses should include answers to the following questions.<br />1.	What is your organization's approach to raising the funding necessary for operations?<br />a.	What would be the planned source(s) of funding?<br />b.	What is the estimated amount of time needed to raise sufficient funds?<br />2.	 Given the financial and operational constraints stated in this RFI, what is the earliest date your organization would plan to start transitioning into funding Spitzer operations?<br />3.	How would you organize and execute a Spitzer observing program, including any science program?<br />4.	What is the benefit to the Nation for such a partnership?</p>
<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Responses to this RFI must be delivered as an email attachment in PDF format to jeffrey.hayes-1@nasa.gov, no later than December 1, 2017, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. An email confirmation of receipt from NASA will be sent within a one-week period to the designated point of contact. Questions concerning this Request for Information may be emailed to the same email address (subject line to read "Spitzer Operations RFI").</p>
<p>The information obtained will be used by NASA for planning and acquisition strategy development. NASA will not publicly disclose proprietary information obtained as a result of this RFI. To the full extent that it is protected by law and regulations, information identified by a respondent as Proprietary or Confidential will be kept confidential.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
<p>It is emphasized that this RFI is NOT a Request for Proposal, nor Invitation for Bid. This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only, and the Government does not intend to award a contract at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Pursuant to FAR 52.215-3, entitled Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, this information is being made available for market research, information, and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition. This RFI is subject to review or cancellation at any time and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract. The Government will not pay for the information submitted in response to this request.</p>
<p>Following this initial feedback, as part of its market research, NASA may conduct one-on-one meetings with potential offerors. These meetings will allow for exchange of information.</p>
<p>Please do not request a copy of the solicitation, as no solicitation exists at this time. If a firm requirement is developed and a solicitation is issued, the solicitation will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (www.fbo.gov) and the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) (http://procure.arc.nasa.gov ). It is the responsibility of offerors and interested parties to monitor the Internet sites for the release of the solicitation and amendments, if any, and they will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the documents. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.</p>

<DESC>Jackson Heart Study - The goal of this acquisition is to provide a Coordinating Center to continue to maximize the use of data and samples amassed on the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohort and to address new questions about the development and progression of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related conditions. The scientific objectives are to (1)investigate factors that account for the high burden of CVD in African- Americans, with specific focus on factors related to ventricular dysfunction and heart failure and impaired cognitive function; and (2) improve statistical power for further risk prediction and hypothesis testing, particularly in informative subgroups. The operational goals are to(1) continue to foster scientific collaborations; work collaboratively to (2) provide cohort follow-up and clinical events ascertainment activities; (3) conduct a clinic examination of the JHS participants; (4) promote cardiovascular health in the local community; and (5) encourage underrepresented minority students to pursue biomedical careers.

<p>The maritime support services and logistics include support for data acquisition systems, offshore test ranges, underwater sensors, systems, infrastructure, shore based sensors and systems, boats, vehicles, equipment shelters, weight handling equipment (WHE), observation towers, and tracking systems for South Florida Ocean Measurement Facility RDT&amp;E activities. Emergent support is required to efficiently and effectively deal with the effects of the tropical marine environment, where high temperatures, high humidity, corrosion, and destructive weather can impact the scheduling and activities of the site, requiring immediate and proactive action to repair damage and resume operations.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that a resultant contract will provide support services primarily at the South Florida Ocean Measurement Facility (SFOMF) Area of Operations (AOR) defined by the U.S. territorial, Federal, and international waters from Port Canaveral to Key West and the adjacent land masses with significant ocean testing and waterfront operations required outside the physical location of SFOMF.</p>
<p>The Government's acquisition strategy includes the following:<br />&bull; Hybrid contract consisting of Cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract line item numbers (CLINs) for approximately 94% of performance and Firm-fixed-price (FFP) CLINs for the remaining 6% of performance;<br />&bull; Best value trade-off source selection procedures;<br />&bull; Period of performance of five years consisting of a one-year base period and 4 one-year option periods.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 4888390, Other Support Activities for Water Transportation. The associated size standard is $38.5M in annual receipts. For more information about size standards, please refer to http://www.sba.gov.</p>
<p>In accordance with the market research performed by the Government, this requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis.</p>
<p>The Support services are currently being satisfied under contract # N6554-14-D-0008, Seaward Services Inc., 222 Pearl Street, New Albany IN 47150-3468.<br /><br />The POC for this procurement is Mr. James M. McGarvey, Contract Specialist, email: james.m.mcgarvey@navy.mil.</p>
<p>Please note that is a notification only. The Government is not responding to questions/comments in response to this notice.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the release of the solicitation on or about 9 November 2017.<br /><span><span><span><br /><strong>UPDATE:&nbsp; The Request for Proposals (RFP) was released on 11/9/17<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></strong></span></span></span></p>

<br /><br />HOW TO OFFER: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 18-REG01. In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.<br /><br />Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period". <br /><br />The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Refer to AAAP RLP paragraph 3.02.A for more details on the offer submission process. The Government reserves the right to allow for multiple Open Periods prior to selecting an offer for award to meet this specific space requirement. Offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.<br /><br /><br />Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During the Open Period, offerors will be permitted to submit new offers or modify existing offers. Offerors can draft an offer at any time; however, you can only submit an offer during the Open Period.<br /><br />The offered space must comply with RLP 18-REG01 and must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements, including requirements for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, seismic, energy, and sustainability standards in accordance with the terms of the Lease.

<DESC>THIS REQUIREMENT WAS ORIGINALLY ANNOUNCED AS W9127N-17-Q-0025.
<p>US Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District is soliciting for the purchase of twelve (12) hydro-turbine thrust bearing oil coolers for use at The Dalles Lock and Dam Project. On or about 01 December 2017 a formal request for proposal with detailed specifications will be attached to this announcement.<br /><br />The vertical loads in a hydro turbine-generator are supported by the thrust bearing. The oil film bearing assembly and the heat exchangers (cooler) are submerged in an oil bath (thrust tub) for lubrication and heat transfer. Cooling water (river water) is supplied through gravity flow through the coolers. Two unique types of coolers will be purchased.</p>
<p>Nine (9) main unit coolers consist of two semicircular sections where cooling water flows through rows of finned tubes that are supported by a steel frame. The government does not have any detailed drawings for these coolers. As such, the new coolers will have to be reverse engineered, and a drawings generated and approved by the government. The finned tubes are a double tube design. The outer tube will be made from copper and will have integral, helical fins that are extruded. The inner tube will be made from 90/10 copper nickel and will be mechanically expanded into the outer tube. The tube dimensions including inner diameter, wall thickness, fin density, fin thickness, and fin outer diameter will all be identical to the existing coolers. The coolers are capped on the ends with water boxes. The water boxes act as a plenum, or header, to distribute water to the finned tubes. The supply and return piping is attached to the water boxes. The tube sheets are a plate that holds the finned tube array in place. The ends of the finned tubes are expanded into the tube sheets for a secure, mechanical connection. The tube sheets also provide a means to connect the finned tubes to the water boxes. The tube sheets will be made from naval brass. The cooler frames support the finned tube array as well as secure the coolers to the thrust tub. The frames will be made from carbon steel.</p>
<p>Three (3) station service unit coolers will have informational drawings provided, from which shop drawing will be generated and approved by the government. The station service unit thrust bearing oil coolers consist of two sections of coiled 90/10 copper/nickel tubes that meet the requirements of ASME B16.15, ASME B16.18, ASME B16.22, and/or ASME B16.29. The coil will have to be fabricated from more than one piece of copper due to the length, but the fabrication would be such to minimize the number of joints. The cooler fittings will also be copper, and the cooler frames will be steel that meets the requirements of ASTM A36/A36M</p>
<p>This solicitation will result in a firm fixed priced contract. The delivery schedule is defined in the solicitation with final closeout anticipated to be 275 days following Notice to Proceed. One contract will be awarded to a single contractor. This is a Total Small Business Set Aside, using FAR Part 15 Best Value Trade Off selection criteria.</p>
<p>The following is the list of all items to be purchased:<br />Nine (9) main unit thrust bearing oil coolers<br />Three (3) station service unit thrust bearing oil coolers</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this work is 332410 with a size standard of 750 employees. The PSC code is 4420. Should you have any questions, feel free to contact the buyer listed on this announcement.</p>

<DESC><p align="left">This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The information provided herein is for information only and is intended to initiate communication with industry in order to assess market potential. No solicitation document exists at this time. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. Responses to this RFI that indicate that all information therein is proprietary or represents confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for U.S. Government use only.</p>
<p>In accordance with Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) Instruction 5400.15C, Department of the Navy (DoN) Research and Development, Acquisition, Associated Life-Cycle Management, and Logistics Responsibilities and Accountability, dated 02 December 2011, MARCORSYSCOM has the responsibility to centrally manage the procurement of the Scout Sniper Spotting Scope.</p>
<p>MARCORSYSCOM plans to procure approximately 1,500 new Scout Sniper Spotting Scopes, training and manuals, on one contract at a future date.</p>
<p>MARCORSYSCOM would like interested vendors to provide capabilities documents, monthly production capacity, as well as Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) pricing, to include any economies of scale or bulk purchase discount for up to 1,500 systems. Vendors are encouraged to submit responses that may include attributes other than the below if they feel it would benefit the Government.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI will allow MARCORSYSCOM to determine if an Industry Day is warranted, and if it is advantageous for vendors to showcase their Scout Sniper Spotting Scopes product(s) in person.</p>
<p>Any future contract structure is anticipated to be Firm Fixed Price.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to query industry on it's capability to provide a Scout Sniper Spotting Scope that will deliver the ability to observe, detect, identify, surveil, and acquire targets at distances greater than 1,200 meters.</p>
<p>At a minimum white paper responses should address the following:</p>
<p>- Weight<br />- Length<br />- Field of view<br />- Variable power magnification<br />- Available reticles<br />- Eye relief<br />- Lens coating<br />- Accuracy in target detection, recognition, and identification<br />- Laser filtering capability and anti-reflective device<br />- Ability to co-align with a laser rangefinder and night vision device<br />- Interchangeability of eyepieces or ease of upgrading components<br />- Accessories (tripod, carrying bag, scope case, cleaning kit, special tools, mounting interface, etc.)<br />- Technical Readiness Level<br />- Planned product improvements, such as integration of laser rangefinder and ballistic solver data<br />- Supportability/Maintainability, product lifespan, and warranty <br />- Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear resistance<br />- Commercial availability and any Government contract schedules, if applicable<br />- Description of any environmental testing, in accordance with MIL-STD-810G</p>
<p>MARCORSYSCOM requests the following additional information:</p>
<p>(1) Cover page to include:<br />&#61623;- Company name<br />- Point of Contact information<br />- Business Size Status<br />- DUNS number<br />- CAGE code</p>
<p>(2) Provide a white paper not to exceed 10 pages which gives a summary of your product and manufacturing capability. Request your white paper address your ability to successfully complete first article testing. You are highly encouraged to provide test data substantiating any performance claims made in your response, which will not count against the 10-page limit.</p>
<p>(3) Provide ROM pricing on the total cost of the Scout Sniper Spotting Scope, including but not limited to, the estimated unit cost and separate pricing for any ancillary gear. If applicable, please also include any step ladder pricing that may be relevant. Additionally, request you provide all ROM pricing data associated with copyright release for associated technical manual(s), including instructions, maintenance, and procedures, vendor level drawings, and Instructor and Key Personnel training. Also, request you provide information regarding any availability of your product through any other government procurement avenues.</p>
<p>The Government may use contractor support from Knowledge Capital Associates (KCA), or other contractors, to help review responses. All contractor support personal have corporate level non-disclosure agreeements on file with MCSC.</p>
<p>Any questions, comments, and RFI responses should be submitted via the AMRDEC Safe Access File Exchange (SAFE) (https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe/). A "Getting Started Guide" is located on the home page, if needed. Responses may be submitted as a "guest" for any respondent that does not have a DoD Common Access Card (CAC). The recipient of all documents submitted via SAFE is tammy.wright@usmc.mil.</p>
<p>Responses are to be submitted via the AMRDEC SAFE; all attachments must be in Microsoft Office products or Adobe Acrobat formats. If sensitive, or proprietary, information is to be submitted, please do so via USPS with an email notification to Tammy Wright, tammy.wright@usmc.mil. The mailing address is: Commander MARCORSYSCOM, Attn: Tammy Wright, Infantry Weapons, 2200 Lester St. Quantico, VA 22134.</p>
<p>To aid the government in its review of your response, please segregate proprietary information from the rest of your response, and comply with the 10-page limit for the white paper. Please be advised that there is a 2 gigabyte size limit for submissions via AMRDEC. All e-mails larger than this may not be delivered, and should be sent via regular mail. Please submit any questions or comments directly related to this RFI via email NLT 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 3 November 2017. <strong>RFI responses via AMRDEC SAFE or mail should be received no later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 17 November 2017. <br /><br />Do NOT send responses by direct email as all attachments will be stripped and not delivered properly.<br /></strong><br />-------------------<strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /></strong><br />Q1: As this is a legacy capability, can the Government provide the current requirement and/or former solicitation used when originally procured? <br />A1: The intent of this RFI is to initiate communication with industry in order to assess market potential. The information provided by industry will inform the requirements process for future spotting scopes for the United States Marine Corps (USMC).</p>
<p>Q2: Is the Government seeking a different system capability or is this current interest a result of inability to procure additional legacy systems? <br />A2: The Government is gathering information to define a future system capability.</p>
<p>Q3: Is this effort funded and is there a rough timeline for possible solicitation? <br />A3: The RFI states that, "no solicitation document exists at this time". The Government is gathering information to define a future system capability.</p>
<p>Q4: The Government states they want a scope with "the ability to observe, detect, identify, surveil, and acquire targets at distances greater than 1,200 meters." This is difficult to translate as target type, size, conditions, etc. are not defined. Can the Government clarify and simply state what minimum magnification and magnification range it is seeking? <br />A4: The Government is interested in any data provided by the vendor that describes the product's ability to observe, detect, identify, surveil, and acquire targets at distances greater than 1,200 meters, given the conditions and target size defined by the vendor. The Government will determine the minimum magnification and magnification range requirement after assessing industry's capabilities.</p>
<p>Q5: Given variable power requirement, in addition to min and max magnification range, are there any field of view requirements at minimum and maximum powers? <br />A5: No field of view requirement exists at this time. The Government will determine the field of view requirement after assessing industry's capabilities.</p>
<p>Q6: The Government asks to detail "accuracy in target detection, recognition, and identification". This is not measurable as conditions and target size are not specified; can the Government clarify and/or as an alternative state what magnification power range is necessary for the targets the Government seeks to detect, recognize, identify? <br />A6: The Government is interested in any data provided by the vendor that describes the product's accuracy in target detection, recognition, and identification given the conditions and target size defined by the vendor.</p>
<p>Q7: The Government requests information on ability to co-align with a laser rangefinder and a (singular?) night vision device. Can the Government clarify and provide information on these devices? <br />A7: The Government is interested in if the vendor's product can be used with a laser rangefinder and night vision device, and how.</p>
<p>Q8: With respect to an industry day, we would be interested in such an event; would the Government consider doing so during Shot in January 2018?<br />A8: No industry day is planned at this time. The Government will consider any opportunities to meet with industry or observe product demonstrations during SHOT Show in January 2018.</p>
<p>Q9: Is there a reticle the USMC is looking for in the spotting scope? Horus H-32 or Tremor 4 for example?<br />A9. No specific reticle for the spotting scope is required; all possible solutions will be assessed.</p>

The contract is currently valued at $46.3M and set to expire on 25 November 2017. An additional $696,000 is being added to cover continued sustainment support services.</p>
<p>The FLIR contract was awarded non-competitively to FLIR Systems, Inc., pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1 -- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

FLIR is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the FLIR systems and retains proprietary rights/control over parts, components and schematics/drawings necessary to repair the FLIR systems currently being managed by the Program Offices. FLIR is the only source for these R&amp;R services.</p>
