<a href="mailto:shaina.mckeel@us.army.mil">Fort Eustis Contracting Center (W911S0)</a>
<DESC>It is the intent of the Mission Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Center - Ft Eustis, VA to contract for Human Terrain Systems (HTS) for the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence (G-2), Ft Monroe, VA.  <BR><BR>TRADOC G-2 is an innovative, learning, and enabling enterprise that examines national security challenges, defines operational environments, challenges solutions, and expands perspectives in order to enable the human capital enterprise to select, organize, train, and equip the Army to conduct full spectrum operations today and tomorrow in accordance with the Army force generation process.  This requires TRADOC G-2 to become and remain the Army's authoritative expert for current and future operational environments and security challenges.  The HTS consists of the Human Terrain Teams (HTTs), Human Terrain Analysis Teams (HTATs), and Theatre Coordination Elements (TCEs).  The HTTs are small deployable teams combining social scientists and analysts enabled by a MAPPING-Human Terrain (MAP-HT) Toolkit and supported 24/7 by expert researchers and subject matter experts (SMEs) through networked Reachback Research Centers (RRCs).  The HTTs support commanders and staffs at the Brigade Combat Team (BCT)/Regimental Combat Team (RCT) and Division levels, providing specific local cultural knowledge.  The HTTs integrate the human domain or "green layer" for commanders and staff.  The HTTs' operational research provides current, accurate, and reliable data on specific social groups in the areas where the supported units are operating.  This human terrain knowledge is integrated into the Common Operating Picture (COP) to improve the commander's Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP), both in planning and execution.  The HTS enables a more effective rotation of forces through the creation and maintenance of a living, human terrain knowledge base.  The Contractor shall provide support and services to TRADOC in the following specific areas: (1) Provide recruiting, training, and education services. (2) Formulate and integrate services to the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) approach. (3) Establish and maintain an efficient reachback research capability in support of mission analysis and net-centric operations. (4) Have the technical skills to manage database and knowledge reposition, system integration, and analysis in support of evolving and emerging capabilities and requirements. (5) Provide operational support to include pre-deployment and deployment in field environments from within the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) and remote locations (both CONUS and OCONUS) in support of the war-fighter, exercises, and contingency operations.  Support may be conducted in a tactical field environment and require frequent tactical displacement.  Support may require Contractors to travel on military ground, air, or water transportation to OCONUS locations. The Contractor shall comply with Army Regulation (AR) 715-9, Army Contractors Accompanying the Force. (6) Maintain Contractor program management to include overall management of the HTS program, projects, Contractor costs, Contractor personnel, quality control planning and execution, direction, and coordination and reviews. (7) Demonstrate flexibility in the performance of the requirement.  The highly dynamic nature of the HTS mission and related perishable technologies and concepts may require some aspects of the tasks identified to be accelerated and support provided on short notice.  <BR><BR>The requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis.  The Government contemplates awarding one Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with Hybrid Priced Task Orders.  REMINDER:  This is not a Request for Proposal; only a Presolicitation Notice.  A solicitation will be issued at a later date.  All interested parties shall respond to that announcement once it is published.  All correspondence and questions regarding the requirement shall be directed to Shaina McKeel via e-mail only at shaina.mckeel@us.army.mil. <BR>

<DESC>In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) 3.2.1.2.1 entitled Market Analysis, this market survey is advertised to initiate industry involvement, develop the procurement strategy, obtain price information, identify market practices, and determine the level of competition for FAA Support Services that will assist the FAA Aerospace Medical Certification Division (AMCD).  This procurement is the follow-on to contract DTFAAC-11-D-00014 currently performed by CNI Aviation Inc. OKC, OK.  The contract expires October 31, 2011.
The market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA 8(a) certified small businesses.  Responses to this market survey will be used to determine the FAA's acquisition strategy for the prospective contract requirement.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA intends to establish a support services contract by August 2011.  
Potential sources of these services are expected to be categorized in the Sector 518210 of North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  This NAICS comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing infrastructure for hosting or data processing services. These establishments may provide specialized hosting activities, such as web hosting, streaming services or application hosting; provide application service provisioning; or may provide general time-share mainframe facilities to clients. Data processing establishments provide complete processing and specialized reports from data supplied by clients or provide automated data processing and data entry services.  The Small Business size standard for NAICS 518210(Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services) is $25.0 Million dollars.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  When a Request for Proposal is issued the FAA may decide to issue the Screening Information Request for full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTAL OF RESPONSES:All interested sources should provide responses (one response per company) by describing your capability to address the content in Attachment 1 - Market Survey and complete Attachment 2 - Business Declaration (submit SBA/8a Certification letter if applicable).   Provide 2 hard copies - one for the Requiring Organization and one for the Contracting Officer.  All responses to this market survey must be received by Friday, March 18, 2011.  All submittals should be submitted to:

<DESC>Region 8 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to issue a Request for Proposals to provide Preparedness and Prevention and Site Assessment Services. The work will be performed primarily in Region 8 (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota); however, in special circumstances, vendors may be required to perform outside of Region 8 in support of other EPA offices. The NAICS is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, and the small business size standard is $7.0 million. Solicitation SOL-R8-11-00002 will be issued and posted on this website on or around March 22, 2011. The solicitation has been set aside for the 8(a) competitive program. Any responsible 8(a) certified small business may submit a proposal that will be considered by the agency. Region 8 intends to award a hybrid Time and Materials/ Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract consisting of a 1-year base period and 4, 1-year options. The estimated award date is June 2011. Interested contractors should have the capability to provide between 7,723 and 15,000 hours of professional services annually. Potential offerors are advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitation on Subcontracting, will apply to any award. Potential offerors are advised that if they are a current Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team (START) contractor or subcontractor in Region 8, they will be ineligible for award of this contract because of conflict of interest concerns. <br /><br />Joint Venture Agreements: Joint ventures are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides, however, the joint venture agreement must be received by SBA prior to proposal due date and approved before award of any resulting contract. If you are contemplating a joint venture on this project, you must advise, in writing, your assigned SBA Business Development Specialist (BDS) as soon as possible. It is also recommended that the agreement be submitted as soon as practicable to ensure compliance with established regulations. Any corrections and/or changes needed can be made only when your BDS has adequate time for a thorough review before the proposal due date. NO CORRECTIONS AND/OR CHANGES ARE ALLOWED AFTER TIME OF SUBMISSION OF PROPOSAL OR BIDS. <br /><br />Description of work: The Region 8 Preparedness and Prevention Team, within the Preparedness, Assessment and Emergency Response Program provide a combination of services under chemical emergency preparedness and prevention. Varied authorities under which the Preparedness and Prevention Team works include the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), and the Clean Air Act Amendments, (CAA) Section 112(r). Other authorities, though not specifically identified here, may also apply to work conducted by the Team, such as the Oil Pollution Act, and specific Executive Orders. These authorities delegate responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to undertake certain actions with respect to preparedness for and prevention of accidental chemical releases and/or the response, investigation and reporting of chemical releases that have occurred. Chemicals may include oil, petroleum products or hazardous substances. Additionally, EPA is responsible for evaluating uncontrolled hazardous substance disposal sites and placing those considered to pose a significant threat to the public health or the environment on the National Priorities List (NPL). The contractor shall provide consistent advisory and assistance services to the Region 8 Environmental Protection Agency's Site Assessment program (SA). The contractor shall be prepared to provide scientific and technical support for EPA SA activities in furtherance of the agency's primary mission: the protection of health and the environment. The primary objective of the SA program is to obtain the data necessary to identify the priority sites posing threats to human health or the environment. The SA process begins with site discovery or notification to the EPA of a possible release of hazardous substances into the environment.<br />

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The United States General Services Administration has a requirement for the selection of a quality contractor for the Judges Chambers Renovation project at the Sydney L. Christie Federal Building, Fifth Ave. &amp; Ninth Sts., Huntington, WV.  This project is to be awarded as a firm fixed price contract.  The scope of work shall include  complete remodel of the existing 2nd floor law library into a visiting judge's chambers.  Project shall consist of a complete demolition of the space including all finishes and existing walls as applicable. Historical significant wood doors and windows will include finished millwork including new standing running hardwood trim with matching 36" wainscot and custom shelving. Mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) work is also a component of the project. A new restroom with lavatory and sink will be added to the space as well. The total renovated footage of the space is approximately 1700 sf.</p>
<p>The contract duration is scheduled for one hundred and fifty (150) calendar days after notice to proceed. The estimated cost of the renovation is between $500,000.00 to $1,000,000.00.  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.  Accordingly, award will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price-related and non-price related factors.  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer will preclude further participation on this acquisition.     The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1.Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel and 3.  Technical and Organizational Approach.    The NAICS code applicable to this project is 236220 with a small business size standard of $33.5 million.  This procurement is being solicited as Total Small Business Set-Aside acquisition and is open to all interested small businesses.</p>
<p>This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.</p>
<p>The subject solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified Building Information (SBU).

Contractors must then register on the FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov) website and provide the CCR Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) during registration in order to access Sensitive But Unclassified information.</p>
<p>Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation (specifications, drawings, clauses and proposal forms) and for monitoring the website for possible amendments and/or additional information.  Upon downloading the solicitation, contractors shall familiarize themselves with the safeguarding, dissemination, destruction and disposal of SBU information as described in the contract clause, "Safeguarding and Dissemination of Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) Building Information", contained in the solicitation documents.</p>
<p>Contractors are reminded that any SBU information obtained must be destroyed when no longer needed.  Contractors that obtain SBU information must notify the Contracting Officer that all SBU building information has been destroyed by the contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers.</p>
<p>The Solicitation (RFP) will be made available approximately the week of March 21, 2011.</p>

<DESC>A solicitation will be posted on or about 23 March 2011 for the development of medical devices for the detection of transfusion transmitted diseases.  This solicitation is a Performance Based Acquisition. The Government may issue one contract or multiple contracts as a result of this solicitation. Any contract(s) issued as a result of this solicitation shall include Cost Reimbursement terms and conditions. The Government herein anticipates a period of performance of two (2) years with one (1) one-year option period (depending upon the starting maturity of the medical device). Contracts shall be issued on a best value basis. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) has a requirement for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared medical devices for prescreening deployed military forces for Transfusion Transmitted Diseases (TTD) and for blood donor screening for TTDs. tests for prescreening deployed military forces for Transfusion Transmitted Diseases (TTDs).  The requirements identified in the solicitation are to develop two highly sensitive, highly specific, rapid and easy to use disposable Immunologic Clinical Screening devices for use in a technologically constrained, deployed environment. Offerors may submit proposals for the development of one or multiple devices.  <BR>Devices are needed for the: (1) detection of HBV Surface Antigen (HBsAg); and (2) simultaneous detection of multiple TTDs to include, but not limited to, HBV, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 and 2 (HIV 1/2).  The multiplex assay should test for all HBV genotypes and should ideally include two targets for HBV, anti-HBc and HBsAg, though proposals will be considered for devices that detect only one of these targets.  The multiplex assay for anti-HCV should test for all HCV genotypes.  The multiplex assay should detect both anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2. The Offeror shall have a functioning prototype device and testing data to support substantial equivalency to a predicate device (if such a predicate exists), and the testing data  shall  demonstrate that the device can at a minimum meet the Threshold Performance Attributes described in the upcoming solicitation.  All efforts shall be in accordance with FDA processes and requirements for medical device clearance. The ultimate aim is to be able to screen potential blood donors to produce blood products in the deployed setting with methods that mirror as closely as possible the current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) used to produce products in licensed blood donor centers according standards set by the FDA.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE FOR This project includes upgrades to the 4th Floor TB Isolation Rooms located in Building No. 1 of the Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center in Iron Mountain Michigan.  The existing Isolation rooms are not designed to meet current "HVAC Design Guidelines" and airflow volumes do not meet minimum air changes recommended by Centers for Disease Controls (CDC).  The two isolation rooms share a single exhaust system, and the ducts are inadequately sealed.  The system is unreliable due to inadequate controls, and the outdoor termination is at roof level, rather than 10 feet above the roof.  

The project will consist of new dedicated isolation room exhaust fans with variable speed control to assure proper airflow in each isolation room.  Ducts will be replaced with properly sealed and labeled ducting, and the two isolation rooms will have independent pressure monitoring and alarms to verify negative pressure.  New supply air valves will be installed to provide a more accurate supply volume to each room.  Terminations will be 10 feet above the roof of the nearby penthouse, and discharge velocities will be designed to assure that no contaminates are rejected from the building and will not pose a danger to occupants or neighbors. 

All work is to be completed within 180 days after the issuance of the notice to proceed.

This construction project is set-aside for Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSBs). All prospective contractors must be registered on the VetBiz website, www.vetbiz.gov, to be considered for award.

Details of the pre-construction conference will be included in the solicitation packages. 

The solicitation will be issued on/about March 23, 2011 with the bid opening on/about April 23, 2011. The bidder is responsible to monitor and download any amendments from Fedbizops which may be issued to this solicitation. In accordance with Public Law 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Healthcare and Information Technology Act of 2006. Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to VOSB construction firms. The project magnitude range is between $100,00 - $250,000. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 238220; size standard $14 Million applies. In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, Required Central Contractor Registration and in accordance with FAR 2.101, VAAR 802.101, VetBiz Registration, prospective firms must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and in the VetBiz databases prior to award.

<DESC>Synopsis

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), Eatontown, NJ 07724, intends to procure a Call Center to set up the Million Veterans Project (MVP).  This effort will be procured as a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) sole source award under FAR 6.302-5, and VAAR 819.7007.  The Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiological Research Information Center (MAVERIC) research group at the VA Boston Healthcare System has been designated as a VA Cooperative Studies and Clinical Trials Coordinating Center. MAVERIC provides statistical programming and analytical support to a number of research programs around the country. Personalized medicine and large scale genomic research have been established as strategic Initiatives for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the VA Office of Research and Development (ORD).  In order to achieve the longer term personalized medicine mission an infrastructure must first be put into place for collecting, managing, and analyzing genomic data for research operations. Active genomic research efforts in ORD today include genome-wide scans and copy number variation studies in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, post traumatic stress disorder, and also include creation of control groups from the general VHA population within the Million Veterans Project (MVP)  cohort. The goal of this effort is to set up the MVP Call Center and recruit one million veterans.  Recruited veterans will be provided with a toll-free number for the MVP Call Center, monitored by MAVERIC/CSP Genomics Coordinating Center study staff. Study staff will undergo training and be provided with a phone script and FAQ to answer questions that callers have regarding participation in the MVP.  The call center will be capable of making outbound calls to Veterans for follow-up and rescheduling purposes should the need arise. Due to the huge size of the sample cohort an automated turnkey solution is required to make sure incoming calls are not missed and are properly routed. The requested solution has been demonstrated to work with the VA NEC based phone network. It also contains extremely useful features including automatic appointment reminders, 24/7 automated attendant and enhanced call center routing.

The solicitation will be issued as a request for quote (RFQ) from the VA TAC, and the number assigned to it will be VA118-11-RQ-0222.  The associated NAICS code for this effort is 541519, with a small business size standard of $25M.  The proposed action will be a Firm Fixed Price contract, and the equipment shall be delivered 60 days after award.  The anticipated award date is March 2011.

All proposal documents and communications shall be made available through the Contract Specialist, Jessica Adamitis, via email at jessica.adamitis@va.gov, or via telephone at 732.578.5572.

<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (22 CONS) of the 22d Air Refueling Wing is conducting market research to determine the availability, interest and capability of potential small business sources qualified and able to compete for a contract to perform the Furnishing Management Office Service requirements at McConnell AFB, Kansas 67221. The information in this notice is based on the best and most current information available to date. This information is subject to change and is not binding to the Government. Updated information will be provided in future announcements and posted electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities homepage at www.fbo.gov. The Government shall not reimburse the costs of preparing responses to this request for information/sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (AMC), McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas, intends to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) in the May/June 2011 timeframe for the acquisition of furnishing management and facility maintenance services to be performed at McConnell AFB KS. The estimated contract period including all options is 1 October 2011 through 30 September 2016.

<p>22 CONS is interested in quantifying and pre-qualifying the likelihood of setting aside competition for Furnishing Management Office (FMO) services for McConnell AFB to a small business. Depending upon the response to this notice and other market research, 22 CONS may limit the competition to a specific category of small business at the exclusion of all other potential business concerns. This announcement serves as a first step for 22 CONS to determine the viability of setting aside the procurement of FMO services for competition solely within or among certain small businesses in selected categories. This is a Sources Sought Announcement only; no solicitation exists or is available at this time. Requests for a solicitation shall not receive a response.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.

Potential interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package as well as downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any.</p>
<p>AFFARS 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005).<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.<br /><br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618)229-0267, Fax (618)256-6668, email: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

<p><br />1 Introduction</p>
<p>The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) is an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve System that was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The CFPB works to promote fairness and transparency for mortgages, credit cards, and other consumer financial products and services. The CFPB currently employs approximately 200 people and will ultimately employ approximately 1200 people. The CFPB is currently headquartered at 1801 L Street, NW, Washington, D.C. with the potential of temporarily locating staff at other Washington, D.C. facilities.</p>
<p>1.1 Overview</p>
<p>The overall objective is to acquire a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) asset management product that provides a web-based solution to support an automated Property/Inventory Management System (PIMS), utilizing barcode technology to facilitate the collection, management, transfer/movement, storage, and disposition of property. The solution shall use web specific technologies that allow for simple deployment and management requiring only a web browser and connectivity to a web server (via intranet/internet, VPN, etc.) while eliminating the need for complicated software distribution processes. The foundation of the proposed PIMS is an automated, web-based asset management software application that resides on a CFPB server that incorporates barcode technology (hardware and software) to make property records more secure and to ensure strict security, management, control, and maintenance of the CFPB property inventory. The system must be capable of calculating depreciation of capitalized purchases (to include single capitalized items as well as bulk capitalized purchases).</p>
<p>The specific objectives of the project are to:</p>
<p>Identify a barcode-based asset/property management solution that will provide a means to electronically track an unlimited number of assets of various types to replace the current manual means of managing accountable property.</p>
<p>Deploy a customizable COTS-based solution that provides the CFPB with the capabilities to enhance or expand the barcoding software, as needed. CFPB administrator(s) shall be able to add custom fields (text boxes, list boxes, and check boxes) and hide unused fields without any additional development/programming costs.</p>
<p><br />The software shall be flexible enough to allow user-defined fields in addition to the out-of-the-box fields based on the business workflow of property management processes which will be shared with the vendor during the requirements gathering phase to support the required system functionality.</p>
<p>Deliver a system that will be utilized in any/all CFPB field offices nationwide to log property and assets and generate forms and reports remotely.</p>
<p>Import data into existing enterprise applications from the PIMS. Therefore, PIMS must be able to export data into .CSV (comma separated values) format, .XLS, .PDF, .DOC, etc. so that data can be imported to other applications as necessary.</p>
<p>2 High Level Features</p>
<p>The features described below outline the desired functionality for the Inventory Management System:<br />&bull; Generate a property receipt used to document actions such as property transfers or dispositions - printable using standard letter size paper and signature blocks.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a log system to track common inventory management duties such as property acquisitions, transfers, dispositions, etc.</p>
<p>&bull; Electronically transmit documents using internet/intranet communications shall be limited to the use VPN technology.</p>
<p>&bull; Create barcode labels to affix to assets/property.</p>
<p>&bull; Allow users to generate a series of system generated and user defined viewable and printable ad-hoc and pre-defined forms and reports from various data sources in the system with pre-defined logic and layouts, to include daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/annual management and statistical reports, exception reports, audit trail, all property/item transfers and dispositions, number of items entered per year, number of items purged per year.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to generate custom reports for any fields entered using report writing tools compatible with the COTS application software.</p>
<p>&bull; Reports have dynamic filters (based on the report type) that allow users to generate filtered, ad-hoc type output based on their needs for tracking property.</p>
<p>&bull; Support data entry utilizing laptop computers for both remote locations and for office use.</p>
<p>&bull; Generate a list of property and create barcode labels reflecting the designated unique property/record number for the item. These labels will be affixed to the property when property is received.</p>
<p>&bull; The system barcode scanner hardware will read labels for inventory purposes and generate reports based on various requirements (date range, locations, property type, etc.)</p>
<p>&bull; Allow bulk scanning of labels to perform operations such as disposition and reporting.</p>
<p>&bull; All transactions/edits/deletions/system management actions are tracked through an auditing system.</p>
<p>&bull; Automatic control number generation (i.e. a unique system-generated identifier for each asset).<br />&bull; Property entry with strict validation rules.</p>
<p>&bull; System-generated alert functions to notify users of specific property actions that are generated via email clients such as Microsoft Outlook. The alert actions and notifications could vary by asset type or other pre-determined parameters (some of which may be user-defined).</p>
<p>&bull; Document management - ability to store scanned pictures and import/upload digital photographs and Microsoft Word and .PDF documents.</p>
<p>&bull; Standardization - drop down menus for categories and item descriptions.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability for designated CFPB system administrator(s) to add unlimited locations and users (also the ability to set access privileges as needed).</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to structure a query on a variety of criteria.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to sort information on any field.</p>
<p>&bull; Windows-based navigation functionality.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain comprehensive logs of changes made to any record, complete with the old and new versions, date, and user identification.</p>
<p>&bull; Support tickler capabilities that can be set to follow internal policy requirements (e.g. 30 days, 60 days, etc.)</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to calculate depreciation of capitalized assets, based on acquisition date, cost, and depreciation schedule (in months).</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to link individual items to a centrally-capitalized entry (e.g. notebook computers), calculate depreciation, modify depreciation formula of bulk capitalized items, and adjusting appropriately upon disposal/loss of an individual item.</p>
<p>&bull; The barcode system must have the ability to capture information contained in various forms, including these fields:</p>
<p>&#61656; Property ID field<br />&#61656; Property/item description<br />&#61656; Property type<br />&#61656; Field office housing property (office code table)<br />&#61656; Where property was obtained <br />&#61656; Who inventoried property<br />&#61656; Where property is stored/used<br />&#61656; Capitalized items<br />&#61656; If capitalized, bulk or single<br />&#61656; Purchase order or other reference number<br />&#61656; Date Received<br />&#61656; Description/type of Property (built in pull-down tables and open text fields)<br />&#61656; Actual/Estimated Value <br />&#61656; Comments/Notes</p>
<p>&bull; The system must have the ability to document the history of an item from receipt to disposal to include initial receipt, assignment, reassignment, and physical relocation.</p>
<p>The following describes the non-functional requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Allow an unlimited number of digital images to be uploaded to support a property item, so a visual record of the property can be documented.</p>
<p>&bull; Performance of web-based application when accessed over WAN network.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must have the ability to track software and software licensing.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must have the ability to interface with Oracle Financial Systems.</p>
<p>3 Key Design Principles</p>
<p>CFPB is focusing on the following key design principles in structuring a program to meet these needs:</p>
<p>&bull; Web-based COTS asset/property management system product to be installed in the CFPB environment.</p>
<p>&bull; Portable handheld barcode scanners with wireless capabilities that incorporate both wireless and Bluetooth technologies allowing communication with workstations and allow users the ability to transmit/upload data without being docked or attached to workstations.</p>
<p>&bull; The solution must be compatible with the CFPB technical environment described above. Contractor shall work with the hosting provider to install and setup the software in the CFPB's cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>&bull; The application must be compatible and interface with a Microsoft Windows Active Directory.</p>
<p>&bull; The front-end must be customizable.</p>
<p>&bull; The data must be query-able by nSQL.</p>
<p>&bull; Database must be exportable to standard format like CSV.</p>
<p>&bull; CFPB's preference is for solutions with the following general characteristics:</p>
<p>&#61656; Technology stack supports open standards and with broad adoption is the marketplace.<br />&#61656; Architecture enables extensions and customizations without requiring enhancements.<br />&#61656; Architecture enables data to be integrated or shared with other applications and data repositories.<br />&#61656; Architecture allows end users to access applications through web and/or mobile interfaces over SSL VPN.<br />&#61656; Supports use of external identity and access management solutions to control user access to the application.</p>

Waste will consist of kitchen waste from the cafeteria, child care center waste, work area waste, miscellaneous office paper waste to include security waste and warehouse waste, e.g. cardboard boxes; and 3) Ensuring proper disposal of all items and/or recycling of recyclable materials. Contractor shall include in its proposal a plan to recycle at least 75% of waste that is collected from all IRS sites affected by this requirement.

Waste products may include classified and/or sensitive information, which shall be destroyed within a 24-hour period from the time of haul-of/removal from the Governments property. Compliance with this requirement is mandatory and essential to prevent inadvertent disclosure of taxpayer information, which may result in criminal penalties.

Contractor shall securely enclose (with plastic shrink-wrap or equivalent) documents contained in security waste hampers at the time of removal and shall transport said documents in a locked container(s). Contractor shall be responsible for securing all trash at all times during transport and through final destruction and/or recycling. Contractor shall be required to attend mandatory unauthorized access (UNAX) training.

The Government estimates that approximately 2,040 tons of waste will be produced within a given 52-week period, which will include recyclable waste paper, aluminum cans, copper wire, brass plumbing materials, plastics, glass, non-recyclable waste such as paper towels, plastic trash can liners, bags, disposable plates, and cups, food, steel cans, various metal objects, office supply items, etc. Contractor is made aware that daily volumes of waste fluctuate. The Center experiences a significant increase in waste creation during peak taxpayer filing season, which runs from January through May. Contractor may be required to respond to weekend pickup requests, and the number of hauls/trips may fluctuate.

All interested businesses are invited to submit a Capabilities Statement of not more than ten (10) pages (not including past performance information).  The Capability Statement should be tailored to this notice and should specifically address the companys capabilities to provide the services outlined above and the companys experience. Additionally, the response must include past performance on government and non-government contracts and the dates those contracts were effective.  The interested contractor shall include with its response a cover letter, which should include -- 1) company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, email address; 2) DUNS number and CAGE code; 3) the socioeconomic status of the company, i.e., small business concern, 8(a) business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and/or service-disabled veteran-owned small business; and 4) Small Business Certification, if any.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this market research evaluation.

Responses, to include cover letters, Capability Statements, and past performance/corporate experience information, shall be mailed to the Contract Specialist, Andrew J. Baker, at the following address:

<DESC>This partnering synopsis solicits potential partners to participate in developing aproposal addressing the goals and objectives of NASA Research Announcement (NRA)NNH11ZUA001N, NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) and NASA Broad Agency Announcement(BAA) NNH11ZUA001K, Unique and Innovative Space Technology.  The BAA and NRA can beaccessed at: http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/solicitations.do?method=open&stack=push.  Participation in this partnering synopsis is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S.organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions,the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. GovernmentAgencies.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other MinorityUniversities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned smallbusinesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses,and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply.  Participation bynon-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds,in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs.Under the Unique and Innovative Space Technology BAA, the Game Changing TechnologyDivision (GCT), within NASAs Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) is solicitingexecutive summaries, white papers, and proposals for research and development (R&D) fortechnology that is innovative and unique and promises to enable revolutionary(game-changing) improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of our countrys spacecapability. Novel (unique) capabilities are sought in any of the NASA Space TechnologyGrand Challenges or the NASA draft Space Technology Roadmaps.  The Space Technology Grand Challenges can be found at:http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/strategic_integration/grand_challenges_detail.html.The Space Technology Roadmap (Draft) can be found at:http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/roadmaps/index.html.Under the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC), the NRA solicits multiple studies,each of which will investigate an architecture, mission, or system concept that has thepotential to change the possible in aeronautics or space. NASA Innovative AdvancedConcepts (NIAC) is also part of the Office of Chief Technologist (OCT). Concepts proposedfor NIAC Phase I studies must be innovative and visionary, technically substantiated, andvery early in development (10+ years out; Technology Readiness Level 1, 2, or early 3).Focused technology maturation and incremental improvement are explicitly not of interestin this program. In response to the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NNH11ZUA001N, NASA InnovativeAdvanced Concepts (NIAC) and Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) NNH11ZUA001K, Unique andInnovative Space Technology, partners are sought for efforts focused on developing andcharacterizing boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) for aerospace applications. BNNTs arestructurally a close analog of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with the carbon atoms alternatelysubstituted with boron and nitrogen atoms.  The BNNT structure resembles a large aspectratio cylinder with a diameter of several nanometers and a length of many microns tomillimeters and thus can be incorporated into composites and even spun into fibers.  Thefibers are calculated to be the worlds strongest structural fiber above 400C, with anelastic modulus approaching 1 TPa.  High aspect ratio BNNTs are grown by a unique hightemperature method that minimizes defects and creates long tubes. BNNTs are durable atlow temperature in space (-157C) and good thermal stability up to 800C with a lowcoefficient of thermal expansion.  Their strength-to-weight ratios and stiffness aregreater than 95% of carbon nanotube values. The BNNTs described here have been measuredto be as strong as Kevlar, yet they have twice the service temperature. Boron has one ofthe largest neutron capture cross sections of all elements in the periodic table.Nitrogen has a larger neutron capture cross section than carbon. BNNT materials havegreat potential for radiation shielding applications.  The goal of this partnership isfurther develop BNNT lightweight materials to enable advanced future aircraft andspacecraft with improvements in aircraft performance indicators such as reduced vehicleweight, increased strength to weight ratio, and improved durability. BNNT-containingfibers, fabrics, and composites for radiation shielding materials to shield against solarparticle events (SPE) and neutrons will be fabricated and tested. In particular NASA LaRC is seeking potential partners having demonstrated experience andexpertise with synthesis of highly crystalline, high aspect ratio BNNTs, quality controland evaluation, characterization (High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (HRSEM),Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), mechanical properties, electron energy lossspectroscopy (EELS), Ultraviolet (UV) Raman), and purification and dispersion of BNNTs. NASAs intended applications include but are not limited to radiation shielding,structural composites, sensors, and thermal protection systems.  Experience and expertiseis therefore sought for application development using the BNNTs in aerospace systems. Potential partners are requested to indicate which specific opportunity they areinterested in partnering with NASA LaRC, the NIAC NRA and/or the Unique and InnovativeSpace Technology BAA. Teaming with providers of and leveraging emerging technologies, such as current andrecent Small Business Innovative Research awards(http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.fov/SBIR/awards.htm), is of special interest.If selected through this synopsis, it is expected that the selected partner(s) will workwith NASA LaRC scientists and engineers to jointly develop the proposal.  If the proposalis selected, NASA LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the selectedpartner(s) for performance of the proposed tasks.This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts orother agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for theinformation solicited.	It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at nocost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules, andcost estimates. Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria in the followingorder of importance:(1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, key personnelavailability, and demonstration of development of boron nitride nanotubes. This criterionevaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, past performance in similardevelopment activities, technical capability to perform the development, and keypersonnel available to support the development.  Substantive evidence of successfulparticipation in similar developments should be included.(2) Cost and schedule control.	This criterion evaluates the proposers ability tocontrol both cost and schedule.  The proposer should provide evidence of successfullycontrolling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence ofmanagement processes in this area.(3) Facilities.  This criterion evaluates the proposers facilities (development,testing, and analysis) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet theproposed objectives.NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in responseto this synopsis.  NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposal preparationcosts incurred by the team members.RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to 8 pagesin not less than 12-point font.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The Science, Engineering and Diplomacy, Security &amp; Development &shy;Fellowship program was initiated at USAID in 1982. In the 28 year history of the program, nearly 400 fellows have been placed at USAID, in Washington or field missions.&nbsp; The Fellows Program has been a very successful mechanism for USAID offices to access scientists and engineers with up-to-date and diverse technical expertise to meet the Agency's strategic objectives in areas such as climate change, biotechnology, infectious diseases, and energy.&nbsp; In addition, the Fellows bring with them connections to a broad scientific community, expanding USAID's collaborations and partnerships. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The design of this activity is based on the Agency's past experience with science and engineering fellowships.&nbsp; The recipient organization needs to have the capacity to select outstanding postdoctoral-level to senior level scientists, medical doctors, political scientists, and engineers to serve for one to two years in USAID/Washington or an overseas USAID Mission.&nbsp; The placement of Fellows at USAID traditionally has been in offices that carry out the Agency's long-standing programmatic emphasis: agriculture, food security, energy, climate change forestry, disaster assistance, health/population, the environment, education, S&amp;T policy, and democracy/governance.

<DESC>As required by Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.501, a sole source determination has been prepared to document the facts and rationale to support the determination that only one source is available to provide the agency's requirement. The supporting data has been prepared by the Bureau of Reclamation technical personnel.
1. Description of the services:
The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award to Andritz Hydro Corp (formerly known as VA Tech Hydro), a purchase order for the Siemens PLC Software modifications at Yellowtail Powerplant.
Each Generator at the Yellowtail power plant is outfitted with a PLC based digital governor control system that was originally designed, installed, and programmed in the 2001 to 2003 time frame by Andritz Hydro Corp via Contract No. 00CP600520. 
In support of an on-going project to upgrade the Wyoming and Montana area hydro facility Supervisory, Control, And Data Acquisition (SCADA) network, the Yellowtail Unit governor control software must be modified for purposes of power plant/generator optimization. The software modifications will support Western's Automatic Generation Control (AGC) function for their control area, provide plant generation control features at Yellowtail, and provide the Reclamation Operator in Casper with supervision over the controls in order to maintain water constraints and minimize operating costs at Yellowtail
The software that was developed to control the governor response/performance under the original contract is the proprietary property of Andritz Hydro, formerly VA Tech Hydro. Based on their first hand experience developing the existing code and their proprietary rights to the written code, Andritz Hydro needs to be hired as a sole source contractor to design and implement software code changes necessary to support the SCADA network enhancement (Generator Optimization) at Yellowtail power plant.
2. Identify the proposed contractor (with address) and describe why they are the only source capable of providing the supply/service: 
Andritz Hydro Corp, 10735 David Taylor Drive, Suite 500 Charlotte, NC   28262. 
The software that was developed to control the governor response/performance under the original contract is the proprietary property of Andritz Hydro Corp. 
3. Estimated cost: 
$67,500.00
4. Justification and Approval Statutory Authority: FAR part 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B), "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."
5. Additional Information:The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the scope of required services. This is not a request for competitive quotes. Any responses/inquiries received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice may be considered by the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement, if the need arises. 
Responses to this notice shall be mailed or faxed to:  Bureau of Reclamation, GP-5000, Attn:  Arlene Dawson, 316 N. 26th St., Billings MT 59107, Fax 406-247-7798.  Email to adawson@usbr.gov.
Responses should include the firm's DUN and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms shall identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 541511 which is $25.0 million. This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation. 
A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Denver, Colorado, intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to SureWorks, LLC, 618 Teal Circle, Suite 1B, Longmont, CO 80501. This ongoing research and development requirement is for software/electrical engineering support to fully develop a computerized panel display with touch panel interface for the Tracy Fish Collection Facility Count Station.  Fish species and numbers that are sub-sampled during count station procedures will be entered into a computer database using a computerized panel display with a touch panel interface that will be designed to Tracy Fish Collection Management and Operator specifications. This computerized interface would replace the use of paper record keeping and time spent entering the data into a computer later.  Images of seasonally entrained fishes that one could touch on the screen and enter quantity and provide notes if necessary would streamline the data collection process and provide greater accuracy with less human-related error.  Fish entrainment data will be gathered into Microsoft Excel and PDF documents for reporting and data management along with flow, operational, and facility-related information.  The output will also include automated daily graphs of entrainment and may include some statistical analyses with standard reports.  A fish species classification engine will be implemented to the count station in this third year phase of the contractor and Government research and development efforts.  The end goal of the project is to enable automatic identification and morphometric data of collected fish.  Proprieatry software that is being developed for the SmeltCam fish identification device by SureWorks, LLC. in conjunction with Bureau of Reclamation scientists, will be used for count station fish recognition.  Fish at the Tracy Fish Collection Facility are the same as those encountered during the SmeltCam project on the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.  Awarding to another contractor will result in a substantial duplication of research efforts because another contractor would not have the project-specific knowledge (covers a 4 year period of accumulated research effots), time investment, and inter-governmental agency research networking.   Ongoing information and data has been accumulated from both laboratory and field testing of fish identification software and algorithms which cannot be duplicated.   A final consideration is that the current research and development firm has proprietary rights to their developed software.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer.  Responses should include the firm's DUN and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 541990 which is $7 Million.  Any response shall be submitted no later than March 21, 2011, 4:00p.m. MST.   This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation for this ongoing research and development project.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE PROCURED ON A NON-COMPETITIVE BASIS UNDER AN EXISTING INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY CONTRACT FOR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE NIST CENTER FOR NEUTRON RESEARCH (NCNR).
<p>This notice is issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This project is being funded using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds.</p>
<p>Contract Number SB1341-07-CQ-0016, Task Order Number 10478was awarded to Merrick and Company of Aurora, CO on September 23, 2010, in the amount of $4,663,448.08. The period of performance is September 27, 2010, through November 30, 2011.</p>
<p>Description of Services<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/NCNR reactor is equipped with a thermal shield. This radiation shield consists of steel and lead that has to be water cooled in order to be kept at a temperature where it does not change shape under its own weight. Over the many years of usage the thermal shield plumbing has developed tiny leaks, which are impossible to repair.</p>
<p>Work under this task order requires the fabrication of, <br />installation of and training for the upgrade of the thermal shield plumbing system whereby the cooling water is administered by moving it through the shield using a vacuum rather than a positive pump pressure as in the present mechanical configuration.</p>
<p>The task order was awarded on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii).</p>
<p>Modification M001 will be executed to incorporate a task into the task order and modify the payment schedule to include the payment for completion of this task. The purpose of this task is to determine the ability of the west wall to safely support the given C100 floor load configuration and address the behavior of the wall, properties and behavior of the soil and underlayment materials, and structural properties of walls and beams in a vicinity affected by application of a load to the wall due to complex interactions between structural members (including the underlayment). The evaluation shall include determination of compliance with applicable codes, such as ACI 318.</p>
<p>The total firm fixed-price of the task order will be increased $12,806.00 from $4,663,448.08 to $4,676,254.08.</p>

<DESC>NIH intends to award a sole source contract to Alphatec P.C. to provide A/E re-design services for NIH Building No. 16A renovation project in Bethesda, Maryland, under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. Alphatec is the Architect or Record for the original design, and the re-design services are an on-going function of the Architect of Record. It is the intent of the NIH to hold Alphatec fully liable for the contract design documents. This requirement is being conducted in accordance with the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302- 1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." <br /><br />Background: This project started with a study commissioned by the NIH in 2007 to determine the best usage for the building and provide cost benefit analysis of different usage options. The structure, originally built in the 1930's, had been abandoned for use by the NIH in 2002 due to safety concerns and issues making it unsuitable for occupancy. This study was conducted by Alphatec P.C. Based on the results of that study, the NIH contracted with Alphatec to provide a design to renovate the building for office and conference usage and to upgrade the infrastructure to meet modern code and federal facility requirements. NTP for this effort was issued 3/20/2008. Final design was completed in 2008.<br /><br />Prior to construction, this project was designated as a "shovel ready" construction project and eligible for construction funding through the ARRA program. It was subsequently determined that the project should be redesigned as a LEED project to meet current sustainability goals and to comply with revised agency guidance. A new design effort was initiated with Alphatec to redesign to meet these new requirements in July 2009. Final design approval was given to Alphatec for the drawings submitted 1/15/2010. These plans were used as the plans of record for construction bid. Prior to award of a construction contract an additional addenda was required in July 2010 to incorporate new requirements to meet the mandate of the Maryland State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). Construction was started in November 2010. After demolition of interior partitions and finishes, structural issues were discovered that necessitated an additional revision and which forced the layout of the spaces to be amended from the original design.<br /><br />The scope of re-design services to be carried out by Alphatec include the following: <br /><br />-Alphatec will prepare two (2) sets of revisions to the issue for construction documents since the involvement of new Center for Information Technology personnel. This includes architectural layout changes, wall types, door types, finishes, etc., re-design of mechanical unit and air distribution layout, and electrical redesign including relocation of panels, outlets, feeders, etc., in addition to responding to several sets of review comments. <br /><br />-The End User has requested the elimination of structural rafters on the second floor. The SOW includes site visits to measure and photograph existing conditions; prepare sketches for brace removal (2 - 11 x 17 sheets); coordinate among disciplines; and submit electronically. <br /><br />-Alphatec to prepare SHPO concept submission which includes revisions to the Architectural drawings, as well as have the mechanical and structural engineers review the anticipated impact on construction. At the time the SHPO submission was made, it was discussed that any changes to the structure and mechanical systems would be handled either as a design-build with an agreement made between contractor and AE or the AE would review proposed layouts and revisions made by the contractor. <br /><br />-Since the implementation of the SHPO changes there are two main items of redesign including the design of the interior storm windows (if NH deems that wood frame interior storms are required to be installed in lieu of the proposed aluminum frames) and the redesign or review of the mechanical contractor's redesign of the mechanical system at the existing to remain stair location. <br /><br />The NIH intends to retain Alphatec P.C. for the following reasons:<br />&bull; The 100% design was completed and submitted by Alphatec to NIH on January 15, 2010. Thus Alphatec P.C. is the Architect of Record and, as such, stamped/sealed the construction documents. Therefore Alphatec is the firm that is held professionally liable for errors and omissions. Hence, NIH must acquire the services of Alphatec for re-design services.<br />&bull; No other A/E will assume error and omissions liability/insurance for Alphatec's construction documents.<br />&bull; Because of copyright laws, no other architect or engineer can access, modify, or make interpretations of documents stamped by the Alphatec team without specific authority granted by the owner that designed the project.<br />&bull; To re-compete for these A/E services would require a significant amount of time that would delay the construction schedule, which could subject the Government to a claim, and adversely impact the critical ARRA mission.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement is not a set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement.

<SOLNBR>Contract_EP-C-11-009_Modification_4
<ARCHDATE>05072011

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS AS THIS WORK IS ISSUED AGAINST AN EXISTING AGENCY CONTRACT.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The purpose of this Modification 4 is to obligate $350,000in initial funding in support of Work Assignment (WA 0-200). The period of performance for this work assignment will be from March 2, 2011 through December 31, 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of Work Assignment 0-200 of Contract EP-C-11-009 is to conduct up to seven regional Tribal Small Water System Technical Training Workshops. The goal is to provide training to as many of the employees of tribes and territories as possible that received American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding for wastewater and drinking water projects. There are 96 wastewater projects and 64 drinking water projects on Tribal lands. Five projects are in the US Territories. It is estimated that up to 50 attendees will join us at each of the seven workshops.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of the workshops will focus on how best to operate, troubleshoot and maintain small wastewater and drinking water systems. The workshops will also include a module for tribal leaders on effective utility management. One of the most significant challenges with small, rural wastewater systems is the inability or lack of knowledge by their operators to maintain them. Providing technical assistance to Tribal Governments and US Territories can be particularly challenging due to highly remote geographic locations. In addition, many of these communities lack access to technology for webcasts and even basic internet access.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Work Assignment will provide up to seven technical training sessions that are geographically reasonable for these ARRA funded Tribes and Territories to travel to. The Indian Health Service (IHS) will fund travel, hotel, and per diem costs for the attendees. The potential workshop training locations may include: Anchorage, Billings, Rapid City, Seattle, Albuquerque, Minneapolis, and Kansas City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This work assignment is also to provide ways to increase information sharing and improve collaboration between EPA Regions and headquarters and IHS working on Clean Water Indian Set Aside (CWISA) projects using ARRA funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractor support staff identified for these activities must have knowledge of the subject matter, experience developing training tools and techniques, professional tribal work experiences, and knowledge of different learning styles and tribal culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The modification also incorporates into the contract clauses required for contracts involving ARRA funded activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is issued as a Request for Proposal.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) of the US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command proposes to procure a state of the art gunfire system to conduct testing for helicopter vulnerability reduction testing.  The gunfire system must be mountable on a pan and tilt type base and be capable of remote triggering.  The system must have multiple barrels to allow different calibers to be tested with one receiver mechanism and be forklift transportable.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 05-48.  The gunfire system will include two receiver assemblies, one receiver base and interchangeable barrels (see table 1).  <BR>The receiver must serve as a breech/chamber mechanism for multiple calibers, and be able to change and secure barrels for cartridges ranging from 5.45mm to 12.7mm and optionally 14.5mm.  Since the gun system is remotely triggered through a custom solenoid mechanism, the UR assembly shall fire the projectiles through a solenoid adaptable type striker arrangement and be capable of withstanding the maximum proof testing pressures for all specified calibers.  The UR must be finished in a manner to withstand outdoor weather conditions, including humidity and light rain. <BR>The universal receiver (UR) base assembly must be able to hold the universal base and selected barrel assembly securely during the firing process and must be capable of mounting weights to allow for stable operation of the gun system through the range of calibers.  A recoil absorption feature shall be incorporated to minimize the shot-to-shot movement of the base.  The base must be able to pan and tilt the gun system and be readily moveable.  The base must be finished in a manner to withstand outdoor weather conditions, including humidity and light rain.<BR>Two types of barrels are specified:  Rifled velocity barrels and smoothbore projectile tumbling barrels.  All barrels are to be manufactured using steel suitable for high quality rifle barrels and should be finished in a manner to withstand outdoor weather conditions, including humidity and light rain.  The tumble type barrels are to be smoothbore with a 60 degree vertical slant milled through the bore centerline on the muzzle end of the barrel for all 5.45, 5.56 and 7.62 cartridges.  Twelve point 7mm and 14.5mm tumble barrels are to have a 30 degree slant milled in, similar to the smaller cartridges.  All barrels must fit the universal receiver and have a key as to align the barrels in a manner to ensure the tumble slant is vertical.  A single firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  Delivery is intended for the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Fort Eustis, Virginia within 5 months of contract award.  Shipping, crating and estimated delivery time shall be clearly stated in the proposal.  Inspection/Acceptance is Aviation Applied Technology Directorate Bldg 401 Lee Blvd., Fort Eustis, VA  23604.  This procurement will be solicited, evaluated, and awarded using FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Services procedures.  This requirement is under NAICS code 336411.  Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to this procurement described are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement and submitting a quote.  Existing product literature generally available in industry should be submitted with your quote.  All responsible sources that submit an offer will be considered.  <BR>It is the intent to award to the contractor that provides the technically acceptable, lowest priced gunfire system.  A solicitation document is not available.  Proposals are due March 14, 2011, 2:00 PM, E.S.T.  Submit inquiries regarding this procurement to the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate.

Basis For Award
The Government will award one order for the supplies outlined in the Statement of Work.  The Government will select for award the quote(s) that are the most advantageous and represent the  Best Value to the Government.
The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to other than the offeror with the highest technical rating if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.	Award(s) will be made based on the best overall ( i.e., best value) quote(s) that are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the 3 evaluation factors: Technical capability, Price, and Past Performance.  Technical is the most important factor. Price is somewhat less important than technical capability. Past Performance is somewhat less important than Price. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are somewhat more important than Price.  Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offeror.
Discussions
The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial quote should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

Evaluation Factors & Evaluation Approach
Careful, impartial, and full consideration will be given to all quotes received pursuant to the Request for Quotation and evaluations will be applied in a similar manner.  Factors against which quotes will be evaluated are set forth below.  Each quote received will be evaluated by key Government personnel knowledgeable in the respective fields.
Factor 1 - TechnicalThe technical portion of the quote will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on assessment of the stated minimum requirements below.  These items are deemed critical to meet the Governments requirement.  If any one of these requirements is rated as unacceptable this will result in an overall technical rating of unacceptable and the quote will not be considered any further.  In order for a quote to be deemed acceptable it must meet the following minimum criteria:1. shall be a submerged style Computer Numerical Controlled, Electrical Discharge Machine able to accommodate a minimum submerged work piece dimensions of 36x20x8 inches2. The minimum X-Y machining range shall be 12 x 8 inches with minimum U-V Axis travel (from center) of plus or minus 3 inches. 3. The minimum work piece weight capacity shall be 1000 pounds and the chopped scrap wire shall be deposited dry in to a container of sufficient size to allow a minimum of 50 lbs of wire to be collected before maintenance is required. 3. The control shall be an industrial PC type running Windows operating system and program input methods shall be Ethernet, USB flash memory and keyboard. 4. The control shall have the ability to import 2D DXF and 3D IGES and parasolid files directly into the control and shall operate in inch or metric mode, in 4 or 5 place decimal when in inch, 3 or 4 place decimal when in metric. It shall have a minimum 20 GB hard drive with 1 GB minimum user program storage with full program editing capability. 5. The machine shall have auto threading of the wire with scrap wire processor (chopper) and shall be capable of using wire diameter that is .010.  Shall also have the capability to use other wire sizes with different guides in the range of  .006 (or smaller) and .012 (or larger).6. The machine shall fit through a 9 foot wide by 9 foot tall opening and shall not weigh more than 10,000 pounds. The machine input voltage shall be 480 volts.Freight and rigging for all components of this sale to be placed and rough leveled on government specified floor space of B67, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806 shall be included and the contractor shall provide final leveling after installation.
7. Contractor shall provide one original set of operation manuals with the machine installation, with a complete duplicate set on CD with the rights to print more copies as needed. Contractor shall provide one set of any instructional or auxiliary manuals with the rights to print copies from a CD.8. Contractor shall provide training for up to three persons, at ARDEC.  Training shall consist of at least 2 days of structured instruction on machine operation.  Training will be conducted within 3 months of machine installation.9. Contractor shall provide a minimum, full 2-year machine warranty covering all parts, labor, and traveling expenses.
Factor 2 - PriceThe Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total of all quoted prices.   Price will not receive a separate rating. The Government will evaluate price proposed for reasonableness. Price Inconsistencies:  A quote is presumed to represent an offerors best effort to respond to the solicitation.  Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performance and price, shall be explained in the quote.  Any significant inconsistencies, if unexplained, raise a fundamental issue of the offerors understanding of the nature and scope or the work required and their financial ability to perform the contract, and may be grounds for rejection of the quote.
Factor 3  Past PerformanceThe Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with a quoters likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that quoters record of past performance. Offerors shall submit a description of their Federal, State, and local Government and private contracts (all prime and major subcontracts received during the past 3 years) which are in any way similar to the tasks/efforts required in this SOW.  Offerors shall include the contract number, POC name and telephone number.Relevant contracts are Government contracts (prime and major subcontracts) awarded during the past three (3) years, which are similar to the efforts required by this solicitation.  Major subcontractor is defined as one who will be providing critical services or whose subcontract is for more than 25% of the total contract value.
a.	The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy and recency of the offeror's past performance.  When assessing performance risk, the Government will focus its inquiry on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all solicitation requirements. These requirements include all aspects of schedule, performance and supportability, including the offerors record of: 1) conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship 2) maintaining program execution within cost 3) ability to resolve technical and manufacturing problems quickly and effectively 4) businesslike concern for the interest of its customers 5) establishing and maintaining adequate management of subcontractors and 6) quality of product delivered as reflected by returns of product to the vendor for repair.
b.	Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the offerors.
Quotes will be given an risk level rating for this factor in accordance with the following:Risk Level	Definition LOW RISK	Little doubt exists that the quoter can perform the required effort, based on their performance record.
MODERATE RISK	Some doubt exists that the quoter can perform the required effort, based on their performance record.
HIGH RISK	Significant doubt exists that the quoter can perform the required effort, based on their performance record.
UNKNOWN RISK	Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no positive or negative evaluation significance.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-49.***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 327910 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a major national facility for neutron scattering called the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). This facility hosts over fifteen unique instrument stations for use by national and international researchers for materials research. In addition, instruments are also provided for fundamental physics research, neutron interferometry, and neutron optics.</p>
<p>Radiation shielding is an essential component of this facility to ensure the protection and safety of all personnel working in and around these instruments. In addition, it protects the processes within each experiment from becoming tainted by another instrument's operations or by processes within the experiment itself. Steel can provide effective shielding against gamma radiation and is normally used in combination with other materials that block unwanted neutrons.</p>
<p>This procurement is for S-780 cast steel shot that will be used in the shielding surrounding a multi axis crystal spectrometer (MACS) instrument.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>

The non-FAR Part 12 discretionary FAR, DFARS, AFARS, and MEDCOM provisions included herein are incorporated into this solicitation either by reference or in full text.  If incorporated by reference, see provision 52.252-1 for locations where full text can be obtained.<BR><BR>QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE SOLICITATION <BR><BR>Direct questions regarding this solicitation to Selma Rivera @ email:  selma.rivera@us.army.mil.  All questions must be received no later than seven (7) calendar days prior to the closing date established in SF1449 Block 8 (as amended).  The Government reserves the right to not answer questions not meeting this timeline if doing so would result in an amendment requiring an extension of the solicitation and to extend would not be in the best interest of the Government.<BR><BR>(End of addendum 52.212-1)<BR><BR>52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<BR><BR>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors will be used to evaluate offers:<BR><BR>Factor 1. Technical.  <BR>	Sub-factors:<BR>	1A. Management Capabilities.  <BR>	1B. Recruitment and Staffing Plan.<BR>	1C. Quality Control Plan.<BR><BR>Factor 2. Past Performance.<BR><BR>Factor 3. Price.  Price will be evaluated using various price analysis techniques and procedures, including, but not limited to, comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation, comparison of proposed prices with the Independent Government Estimate, as well as any other pricing information available to the Government to establish fair and reasonable pricing and a balanced offer. <BR><BR>See Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 for instructions of the above factors.<BR><BR>Factor 1 is equal in importance to Factor 2.  The sub-factors within Factor 1 (1A, 1B, and 1C above) are equal in importance to each other.  Factors 1 and 2, when combined, are more important than Factor 3.  <BR><BR>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  <BR><BR>Given that FAR 52.217-8 provides that the Government may exercise the Option to Extend Services at the rates specified in the contract (i.e., the rates in effect when the Extension of Services option is exercised), for purposes of evaluating the Option to Extend Services, the Contracting Officer will consider the prices submitted for the base year and each option year, since those are the binding prices should the Option to Extend be exercised.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. <BR><BR>Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<BR><BR>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>(End of provision)<BR><BR>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2<BR><BR>Award will be made using the best value trade-off source selection process.  Award will be made on the basis of the best value offered to the Government of proposals meeting or exceeding the satisfactory standards for the non-cost factors.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, is deemed acceptable to the Government, and whose proposal offers the best value to the Government all factors considered.<BR><BR>It is contemplated that award will be made without discussions with offerors (except communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification).  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary.   If the Government enters into discussions, a competitive range will be established based on the evaluated price and other evaluation factors included in the solicitation.  The Government will limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<BR><BR>Proposal Ratings:<BR><BR>An offeror must receive a rating of at least satisfactory under Factor 1 before being considered further under Factors 2, and 3.  That is, if an offeror does not describe Factor 1, their proposal will not be considered under each of the remaining factors, and thus be ineligible for award.  Further, an offeror must receive a rating of at least satisfactory in each of Factors 2 and 3, and at least satisfactory in each of the sub-factors under Factor 1, in order to be considered for award.  <BR><BR>1. Ratings of an offeror's proposal reflect the Government's confidence in each offeror's ability, as demonstrated in its proposal, to perform the requirements stated in the solicitation.  The following rating scheme for Technical (Factor 1 and sub-factors) will be used: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, and Marginal.  The rating scheme is defined below:<BR><BR>ADJECTIVE DEFINITION AND CRITERIA<BR><BR>Excellent: The proposal demonstrates a superior understanding of the requirements and a new or proven approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has several exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the government.  The proposal has no weaknesses or deficiencies.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will be sufficient to minimize risk.  The proposal is extensive, detailed, and exceeds all requirements and objectives; therefore, has a high probability of meeting the requirements with little or no risk to the government.  Risk Level: Very Low.<BR><BR>Good: The proposal demonstrates a considerable understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the government.  The proposal has no deficiencies and any proposal weakness has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  The proposal generally exceeds requirements in minor areas; therefore, has a strong probability of meeting the requirements with little risk to the government.  Risk Level:  Low.<BR><BR>Satisfactory:  The proposal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements and the approach meets all performance or capability standards.  The proposal has no strengths that exceed the requirement.  The proposal has no material weaknesses and no deficiencies.  The proposal has some weakness that can potentially cause disruption of schedules, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Special contractor emphasis and close government monitoring will minimize any risk.  The proposal meets the minimum requirements; therefore, has an acceptable probability of successfully meeting the requirements. Risk Level:  Low.<BR><BR>Marginal: The proposal fails to meet performance requirements and capability standards in one or more areas.  The proposal has minor omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions without a complete revision of the entire proposal.  The proposal has weaknesses or minor deficiencies that can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis, and close government monitoring.  <BR>Risk Level: Moderate.  <BR><BR>2. Performance risk is defined as "ratings that assess the risks associated with each offeror's likelihood of success in performing the requirements stated in the solicitation based on the offeror's performance record on similar contract efforts.  The following rating scheme for Performance Risk will be used:  Low, Moderate, High, and Neutral.<BR><BR>ADJECTIVE DEFINITION AND CRITERIA<BR><BR>Performance meets contractual requirements, but does not exceed them.  The contractual performance contains some minor problems for which corrective actions were taken by the contractor were satisfactory.  Risk Level:  Low.<BR><BR>Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractor's proposed actions to correct any problems were only marginally effective, or were not fully implemented.  Risk Level:  Moderate.  <BR><BR>Performance does not meet most (or all) contractual requirements.  The contractual performance contains serious problems for which the contractor's actions were ineffective.  Risk Level:  High.<BR><BR>If an offeror has no experience in providing ambulance services, the offeror shall be rated as "Unknown."  The offeror has little/no relevant past performance upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.  Risk Level: Neutral.<BR><BR>3.  All offers must receive a rating of at least at satisfactory, in all areas, in order to be considered eligible for award.<BR><BR>(End of addendum)<BR><BR>WAWF Instructions (local clause available via e-mail request).<BR><BR>Offerors must complete FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial items or do so on-line at http://orca.bpn.gov. <BR><BR>Potential contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) to be eligible for award.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance: Technical, past performance, delivery and price. Technical, past performance and ability to meet required delivery schedules, when combined, are more important than price.

To be technically acceptable, the submitting offeror must submit relevant and current past performance in ALL areas noted in this combined synopsis/solicitation.

<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

      (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
      (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
      (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
          (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
       (ii) Examples.
          (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
          (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
          (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
    (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
      (1) Listed end products.
 Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

<DESC>This is a notice of the Government's intent to award a firm-fixed price, commercial contract for the purchase of 5 ea Pre-Conditioned Air Hose Kits. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. All responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, must be considered by the agency.
<p>THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT RESULT IN AN ORDER AGAINST AN FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE. ANY OFFER WHICH IS PREDICATED UPON THE AWARD BEING PLACED AGAINST AN FSS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.</p>
<p><br />The purchase of 5 Pre-Conditioned Air Hose Kits, each kit consisting of the following: <br />Each kit of pre-conditioned hoses consist of 10 ea LG hoses, 2 ea female connectors, 1 ea 90 degree elbows, 1 ea 45 degree elbows, 2 ea 10' long double "Y" hoses, w/ end caps, 1 ea 10' long triple "Y" hose w/ end caps, and 2 ea 10' long hoses 6" diameter, C-17 stenciled inside.<br />Mfr: PCA Hose Systems, Inc.<br />JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE:</p>
<p>PCA Hose Systems Inc in the only known source available that has an external patented hook and loop velcro, connection that's at least 6" wide to maintain a stronger grip with distinctive features of a flat hose with edge bindings that keeps the hose from twisting, makes it easier to store, reduce scuffing, increase longevity, prevent damage to aircraft and will not be damaged if driven over. Three part construction of the hoses consist of the outer layer which is an oil resistant, waterproof, 18/20 ounce vinyl coated, 1000 denier polyester fabric. The second layer is open-cell foam and the bottom layer is 420 Denier Nylon coated fabric which is used on air bags, and not by any other hose company. This material prevents aircraft damage caused by flaking and cracking of the inner line and could possible cause health issues. All hoses and connections are independently pressure tested to 50' in water for 5 minutes. Other companies such as AMcraft and J&amp;B Aviation do carry flat hoses but don't have the same type hook and loop connections, thickness of materials and are more time consuming to install. Some are equipped with zipper connections which create extra work to replacements when broken or corroded, and won't maintain a solid air tight grip due to zipper connections. Also PCA Hose Systems are currently used by the F-15 and C-5 squadrons and we need our hoses to match up with there's for conformity. There are times when we will need to trade hoses between each other and they need to be the same in order to connect correctly to the AC units. We will have repair kits for this brand of hoses and they need to be able to work between all squadrons for repair capability.</p>
<p>Only quotes for new, unused equipment will be considered.</p>
<p>Price(s) should be FOB Destination (Robins AFB GA 31098). In addition to price and delivery, quote should include your cage code, DUNS number, and taxpayer ID number. Requested delivery date is 30 days ARO or earlier.</p>
<p>Quotations should be emailed to SSgt James E. Kaari (james.kaari@robins.af.mil) no later than Monday,&nbsp;14 March 2011, 4:00 pm EST.</p>
<p>The following clauses are applicable to subject solicitation (current through FAC 2005-49 dated 24 Jan 2011, and DFARS Change Notice 20110120):<br /><br />FAR 52.211-6 Brand-Name or Equal<br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors<br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52-212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7001<br />FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination<br />DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation (Appl if unit price exceeds $5K.)<br />DFARS 252.232.7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (WAWF is the method used by DoD for processing invoices/receiving reports.)</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT #1 RESPONSE TO VENDOR INQUIRIES<br /><br />Please see attached document.<br /><br /><br />****************************************<br /><br />In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of the Director (OD) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences (OBSSR) intend to procure professional services on a sole source basis from Health Services Research Journal, a flagship publication of the Health Research and Educational Trust to publish a special issue on "Methodological Considerations for Measuring Health Care Disparities." The period of performance shall be from date of award through 9/30/2011.
<p>Objective:<br />The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavior and social factors play in health, health care, well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of policies, goals and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research. OBSSR's vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR's plan includes facilitating: a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social sciences research: b) transdisciplinary "team science" that brings together the biomedical, behavioral, and social-ecological perspectives; c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis; d) the translation, implementation, dissemination, and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the sciences of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.</p>
<p>OBSSR proposes to support and fund the development of a special issue of Health Services Research (HSR). The overall goal of the special journal issue is to focus on challenges in the measurement of racial/ethnic disparities in health care and innovative approaches for addressing these challenges to help move the field forward.</p>
<p>Background Information: <br />Racial and ethnic disparities persist in the United States in many areas of health care (Institute Of Medicine [IOM], 2002; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2009), despite numerous private and public efforts to reduce these disparities. Soon after the IOM Report Unequal Treatment (IOM, 2002) systematically documented disparities in multiple segments of the health care system, Congress mandated tracking disparities through the annual National Healthcare Disparities Report produced by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, with an emphasis on trends in disparities across health care sectors. While numerous studies assess racial and ethnic disparities in health care and sessions on the topic are among the best attended at national health policy and public health conferences, there is urgency in the field to move beyond documenting disparities to identifying new strategies for reducing disparities. Advances in measurement and methodological approaches used in disparities research are needed to realize this goal. There are numerous methodological challenges related to identifying racial/ethnic disparities, tracking them over time, understanding underlying mechanisms leading to disparities, and evaluating the effects of policies to reduce disparities. While innovative techniques have been developed, widespread use and further development of cutting edge methods have been hampered by a lack of transdisciplinary collaboration and communication about emerging approaches.</p>
<p>A special issue of HSR dedicated to challenges in the measurement of racial/ethnic disparities in health care and innovative approaches for addressing these challenges would help move the field forward. Specifically, the special issue would provide an overview of the methodological issues inherent in measuring, tracking, and identifying disparity reducing initiatives, and present considerations of and possible solutions to these complex problems of measurement with input from multiple disciplines.</p>
<p>The set of proposed papers reflect work begun at a conference "Methodological and Conceptual Issues in the Measurement of Healthcare Disparities" convened in February 2010 by the Advanced NIMH Disparities Center of the Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research (Margarita Alegria, PI) at Cambridge Health Alliance, and the Harvard Catalyst Health Disparities Research Program (John Ayanian, Director). This conference included presentations and transdisicplinary dialogue among researchers who approach racial/ethnic disparities from multiple lenses, including sociology, health services research, economics, medicine, statistics, geography, and public health. Building on this conference, the special issue of HSR would address various measurement and methodological challenges in disparities research from diverse disciplinary perspectives as a resource for health services and disparities researchers, students, and policymakers. <br />The overarching themes of this special issue will be to: <br />1) Present and discuss measurement challenges in research on mechanisms of health care disparities from diverse disciplinary perspectives; <br />2) Disseminate recent innovations in disparities measurement and methods; and <br />3) Provide guidance to health services researchers on measurement and tracking of health care disparities in diverse contexts.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Agreement: <br />The purpose of this agreement is to provide support for the planning and production of a Special Issue on Methodological Considerations for Measuring Health Care Disparities in the Health Services Research (HSR) journal. This agreement provides funding to support the staff time of the publisher in planning and preparation activities for the special issue. This includes staff time for planning activities to include solicitation of authors, coordination and preparation of journal layout and content, and support for ongoing planning and editorial management meetings. All activities will occur in consultation with the Editors of the special issue. All funds will be transferred directly to HSR for the stated purpose.<br /><br />Below is a summary of the papers proposed for this special issue: <br />I. Measuring "Race" in Disparities Research <br />A. Accuracy of Race/Ethnicity Data - Alan Zaslavsky, PhD (HMS), Professor of Health Care Policy, John Ayanian, MD, MPP (HMS), Professor of Medicine <br />Research on patterns of health and health care that uses Medicare data often relies on racial/ethnic identification in Medicare enrollment files. Previous research (Arday et al., 2000) showed that racial/ethnic identification was fairly reliable for Blacks and Whites but not for other groups, but has not been updated to reflect improvements in CMS data over the last 10 years. Using a very large database (over 600,000 responses) from recent CAHPS surveys of Medicare beneficiaries, we compared self-identification (using the 1997 OMB standard) to CMS enrollment database data. We find that identification of Hispanics continues to have low sensitivity. Furthermore the Hispanics identified in CMS databases differ in age, geographical distribution, and significant characteristics of health and in health care experiences from Hispanics not so identified. Thus while the former represent a group of interest in disparities studies they cannot be considered representative of all Hispanics. Similar issues apply for Asian-Americans.</p>
<p>B. Race, Geographical Ancestry, and Disparities in Disease Risk: Measurement Error - Alexandra Shields, PhD (MGH), Assistant Professor of Medicine <br />As genomics research continues to advance, more information about the prevalence of genotypes that affect individual risk of developing a disease or response to treatment across "populations" is being generated. Some have argued that genetic differences across groups may account for a substantial portion of racial/ethnic disparities in disease prevalence and clinical outcomes. The measurement of "race" in health services research has been a longstanding methodological concern; the use of racial categories in genomics research is far more complex and controversial. This paper addresses problematic issues of measurement in the literature on "racial" differences in risk of disease or response to treatment based on allele frequency differences across "populations," and discusses the implications of these methodological issues for future health disparities research.</p>
<p>II. Measuring Health Care Disparities <br />A. Implementing the IOM Definition of Healthcare Disparities to Identify, Track, and Understand Mechanisms of Disparities: A Guide for Health Services Researchers -<br />Benjamin Cook, PhD (CHA), Instructor in Psychiatry; Margarita Alegria, PhD (CHA, HMS), Professor of Psychology; Thomas McGuire, PhD (HMS), Professor of Health Care Economics; Alan Zaslavsky, PhD (HMS), Professor of Health Care Policy <br />Numerous definitions and methods have been proposed and used to measure disparities. These authors propose an IOM method of disparities and there has been some uptake of the use of these methods. However, while there has been diffusion of these methods, the widespread use of IOM-concordant methods has not been realized. The authors present a guide to implementing disparities methods in two contexts: 1) implementing the IOM definition of disparities to identify and track health care disparities over time (rank and replace, propensity score, and reduced models); and 2) identifying and understanding underlying mechanisms that are driving disparities (decomposition techniques and mediation analyses). The authors present best practices for each context, and weigh the pros and cons of alternative methods.</p>
<p>B. Rethinking Disparity Measure: Assessing the Role of Causality in Disparities Estimation - Xiao-Li Meng, PhD (HU), Whipple V. N. Jones Professor of Statistics, Harvard University; Julia Lin (CHA); Margarita Alegria, PhD (CHA), Professor of Psychology; Naihua Duan, PhD (CU &amp; NYSPI), Professor of Biostatistics <br />Much of the literature on measuring disparity emphasizes the need to making a fair assessment. For example, in assessing health care disparities across racial groups, adjustment is needed for existing differences in clinical needs. Whereas the rationale for such fairness considerations is clear, it is much less clear how to actually carry out an adjustment that substantiates the fairness as intended, instead of providing an apparent "equality" based on meaningless or even misleading adjustments. The very common practice of creating a counterfactual population by simply making a minority population's variables for adjustments (e.g., clinical needs) to have the same distribution as that from a reference population (e.g., White), while holding everything else unchanged, suffers exactly that problem because it effectively ignores the natural dependence between the variables to be adjusted and those not to be adjusted (e.g., nativity). Summarizing the findings in Duan, Meng, Lin, Chen, and Alegria (Statistics in Medicine, 2008, 3941-56) and more recent work, this paper demonstrates the danger of such misguided adjustments and the need to consider causal relationships among adjustable and non-adjustable variables in order to construct counterfactual populations that can substantiate the fairness as intended.</p>
<p>C. International Comparison of Methodologies used in Disparities Research - Jason Beckfield, PhD (HU) Assistant Professor of Sociology; Sigrun Olafsdottir, PhD (BU) Assistant Professor of Sociology, Harvard University <br />Cross-national comparative research on health disparities has been hampered by a number of methodological challenges, including a lack of comparable data on health care systems, health disparities, and socioeconomic position. This paper reviews the motivations for comparative research on health and healthcare disparities, and discusses recent advances in the measurement and modeling of social inequalities in health and healthcare across different countries. The threats to causal inference that are common in comparative research will be reviewed, and recent comparative research will be discussed, with the aim of advancing new lines of inquiry that place disparities in a comparative context.</p>
<p>III. Approaches to Gain New Insight into the Mechanisms Leading to Health Care Disparities <br />A. Neighborhood Context, Social Determinants - Jennifer Haas, MD, MPH (BWH), Associate Professor of Medicine, David Williams, PhD, MPH (HSPH), Florence and Laura Norman Professor of Public Health, Kellee White, PhD, MPH, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health, The University of South Carolina</p>
<p>Increasingly, there is substantial interest in the documentation of the role of place in shaping the delivery of health care. Recent evidence demonstrates that the quality, accessibility, availability, and affordability of healthcare resources often reflect the geographic distribution of race/ethnicity or income in a neighborhood. However, emerging complexities in measurement and analysis have implications for understanding, interpreting, and addressing inequities. In this article, we critically evaluate the relation between health care disparities and neighborhood contextual factors. With a particular emphasis on racial/ethnic residential segregation, the authors will summarize the extant empirical research and highlight key measurement and methodological challenges. Suggestions for future research directions and the implication for policy solutions and interventions will be discussed</p>
<p>B. Jointly Addressing Race/Ethnicity and Socioeconomic Status in Health Disparities Research: <br />The Case of Lung Cancer - David R. Williams, PhD, MPH (HSPH), Florence and Laura Norman Professor of Public Health, K. Vish Viswanath, PhD (HSPH), Associate Professor of Society, Human Development and Health, and other researchers from the Lung Cancer Disparities Center <br />This paper will describe a framework for understanding and addressing the joint contribution of SES and race/ethnicity to disparities along the continuum of lung cancer. It emphasizes the importance of multiple vulnerabilities and the need to examine how racial/ethnic status combines additively and interactively with SES and other social statuses to facilitate or restrict exposure and response to risk factors and resources relevant for lung cancer. We show how this approach can provide a clearer picture of the contribution of SES to disparities across the continuum of lung cancer and facilitate assessment of how much of the observed racial/ethnic disparities in lung cancer are due to SES. It will also shed light on the dynamic and interdependent processes that are operative when race and SES combine to affect patterns of risks and resources and privilege and disadvantage that can affect health risks across different social contexts. In addition, this approach can facilitate the delineation of the factors that contribute to any residual effect of race and enhance our ability to identify clear targets/avenues for effective intervention. We will show how studying race/ethnicity and SES differences together, in lung cancer and health status and heath service use more generally, can begin to facilitate the identification of the potential avenues of improving overall population health that apply to all groups, and the conditions under which race/ethnic targeted interventions are indicated. Efforts to understand and effectively address disparities in health status and improve overall population health must target both socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities.</p>
<p>C. CBPR - LeRoi Hicks, MD, MPH (BWH), Assistant Professor of Medicine, Denise De Las Nueces, MD (BWH), Clinical Fellow in Medicine <br />This paper will review all available clinical trials incorporating CBPR methodology since 2003. Its goals are to assess published descriptions of the extent of community involvement, rates of successful participant recruitment of minority populations, types of interventions assessed via CBPR and success in changing clinical or behavioral outcomes. <br />D. Vignettes in Ethnic/Racial Health Disparities Research - Alexander Green, MD, MPH (MGH), Assistant Professor of Medicine, Sheri Lapatin (CHA), Ligia Chavez (UPR), Marta Gonzalves (CHA); John Ayanian, MD, MPP (HMS), Professor of Medicine; Margarita Alegria, PhD (CHA); <br />This paper will address vignettes as a useful and appropriate methodology to tackle questions of healthcare disparities. It will explore the particular utility of vignette methodology, in that they easily allow alteration of specific aspects of a vignette case subject (i.e., race/ethnicity or gender) and thereby make it possible to explore difference in judgments according to these aspects by clinicians or patients. The paper will also shine a light on implicit bias as a controversial issue, and explore question of the validity of vignettes as a good predictor of individual action.</p>
<p>E. Disparities in Mental Health Services: Results from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological Survey - Margarita Alegria, PhD (CHA), Professor of Psychology, Julia Lin (CHA); Chih-nan Chen, Research Associate, Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research; Naihua Duan, PhD (CU &amp; NYSPI), Professor of Biostatistics, Colombia University; and Xiao-Li Meng, PhD (HU), Whipple V. N. Jones Professor of Statistics, Harvard University</p>
<p>In this study we estimate the extent of mental health service disparities using innovative methods to adjust for differences between African Americans/ Latinos and non-Latino Whites in mental and physical health status. We also explore the role of sociostructural, contextual, and health system factors as potential mechanisms of mental health service disparities. These findings can be used to target resources, develop coherent public policies, and inform guidelines aimed at making mental health prevention and treatment services more responsive and sensitive to the needs of ethnic/racial minorities. The NLAAS, NCS-R, and NSAL samples were developed using integrated methodology as part of the NIMH Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys allowing us to pool the three data sets for all reported analyses. Our findings suggest that when we adjust the minorities to have the same level of mental health clinical needs as the non-Latino whites given their SES status, we see that African Americans use significantly less services than non-Latino whites (28% versus 38% respectively) and Latinos use services at a comparable rate (39%) as non-Latino whites. We proceed to evaluate how insurance, education, and geography can help explain the disparity. Our results suggest that different interventions will need to be implemented for the different minority groups to eradicate service disparities</p>

<p><br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Barksdale AFB, Louisiana -- 2d Contracting Squadron is seeking industry feedback for assistance in drafting a solicitation for a Contractor Operated Civil Engineer Supply Store (COCESS) serivice/commodities contract. In accordance with FAR 16.203, and prescribed in clause 52.216-2, an economic price adjustment (EPA) will be incorporated when the contracting officer determines it is necessary either to protect the contractor and the Government against significant fluctuations in labor or material costs or to provide for contract price adjustment in the event of changes in the contractor&rsquo;s established prices. EPA will be based on established prices and contractors have an affirmative responsibility to request equitable adjustments for price inflation as well as deflation. This REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is being issued to help determine which commodities (on attached list) would most likely be subject to price fluctuations as a result of economic factors and require an EPA on a periodic basis. Additionally, we&rsquo;re looking for industry feedback on what the frequency should be with performing EPAs. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor quotes. No award will be made as a result of this RFI. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI. This FedBizOps sources sought notice is strictly for market research. Acknowledgment of receipt of response will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of Government's evaluation of the information received. As a result of this RFI, the Government may issue a RFP; however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to the RFI (e.g. use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement). All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business (e.g large business, small business, service disabled, HUB zone, 8(a), etc.) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 332510, size standard 500 employees. Please respond by 1600 CST, 14 March 2011. <br /><br />Please provide: <br /><br />1. Recommendations on which commodities should be subject to an EPA. <br /><br />2. Brief explanation of why recommended commodities should be subject to an EPA. (ex. rising/decreasing costs in market, supply shortages, etc.) <br /><br />3. Recommended frequency to conduct an EPA. <br /><br />4. Business size and type. <br /><br />5. Recommendation of what the aggregate of increases in contract unit price should be. (ex. 10 percent)

<DESC>TYPE OF ANNOUNCEMENT: Presolicitation Notice for Solicitation FA8629-11-R-2282<br /><br />ADDED: 29 November 2010<br />This is a Notification of Contractual Action (NOCA) Pre-solicitation notice issued in accordance with FAR 5.203. This is not a request for a quote, proposal or an invitation for bid. This acquisition will be a total Small Business set-aside in accordance with FAR 19.502-2. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.219-6 apply. This clause will appear in the solicitation Request for Proposal. The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government.
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>The work to be performed will be to provide a receiver aircraft with probe/drogue air refueling capability with a C-130 type tanker aircraft. The effort will entail multiple sorties to evaluate the VSD flight characteristics prior, during and after dry aerial refueling. The tanker will utilize the standard Sargent Fletcher wing refueling pod and up to three developmental Variable Speed Drogues(VSD). Contractor shall provide at minimum a 2 seat aircraft with sufficient room in the cockpit for the second crew member to operate photo/test equipment. The receiver aircraft should be able to have government data gathering equipment installed or able to accommodate data gathering equipment to be brought onto the aircraft. Such instrumentation shall be approved by the contractor and the USAF. The contractor shall provide a functional MA-2 flexible tip probe equipped aircraft that is physically compatible with the prototype VSD(s) attached to a MA-2, MA-3 or a MA-3-1coupling. The VSD(s) are approximately 50 inches in diameter and 25 inches in depth(measured from the coupling latch point to the center of the perpendicular plane across the trailing edge of the drogue). The Aircraft shall support VSD testing throughout the CV-22 refueling envelope (150-210 KEAS) at altitudes from 3000-20000 ft MSL. The contractor shall also provide highly qualified pilots current in aerial refueling, and necessary ground support to complete a surrogate receiver test effort. For purposes of this contract, aerial refueling currency is defined as "at least one probe/drogue receiver contact within the 90 day period prior to the first scheduled receiver test sortie." The contractor needs to have a facility to support a C-130 aircraft or be able to deploy their aircraft to Elgin AFB, FL for approximately one week. A site visit may be scheduled prior contract award.</p>
<p>The proposed contract will be a Service Cost-Plus-Fix-Fee(CPFF) type contract with a period of performance from 01 February 2011 to 30 April 2011.</p>

<CONTACT>Leslie L. Halberg, Contract Specialist, Phone (724) 794-7172, Fax (724) 794-7199, Email leslie.halberg@opm.gov
<DESC>Request for Information
U.S. Office of Personnel Management - Federal Investigative Services
eAdjudications Solution
1.	 SYNOPSIS
This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotations. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they effect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach. Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Interested vendors responding to this RFI may provide capability information for all pieces of this requirement or for an entire solution.  Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided; however information gathered may be utilized for technical and acquisition purposes.  Time permitting and depending upon the information received individual vendors MAY be contacted for product demonstration.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any costs associated with such demonstration(s) of any software products.
2.	  SCOPE
The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Federal Investigative Service (FIS) is conducting a market survey for an on-line adjudication workflow system to support FIS customer agencies in processing personnel security and suitability cases. The system must be capable of integrating with electronic components of the OPM-FIS EPIC suite of automated systems, and must provide basic functionality for processes performed by adjudications staff.  
In addition, FIS requires information about support services including but not limited to: project management, system integration and implementation, ongoing system maintenance requirements, help desk support and transition to operations and maintenance.
3.	BACKGROUND 
FIS is responsible for conducting a majority of the background investigations (BIs) for the Federal Government to support Suitability and National Security Clearances.  FIS has taken great strides in reducing the amount of time to process BIs by a combination of process improvements and technology innovations.  As part of these technology innovations, FIS has developed and implemented government-wide technology solutions including (but not limited to) the Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing (e-QIP), the Central Verification System (CVS), and Electronic Delivery.  Collectively, these systems, which are part of the OPM-FIS suite of automated systems known as EPIC, allow OPM and its customer agencies to meet the ever-increasing demand for faster and more efficient processing and adjudication of cases without sacrifices to thoroughness and quality.  
Through this RFI, FIS is seeking information as to available products and services in order to inform a make/buy decision for offering an on-line, real-time adjudication system for customer agencies. In this regard, the system must be flexible to deploy in EPIC environment as described in section 4. Specifically, FIS seeks a solution that integrates with existing FIS systems and EPIC architecture, and reduces reliance on paper-based processes. This system should also eliminate or reduce the need for customer agencies to maintain their own systems for performing basic process in adjudicating their cases.
4.	 HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
Adjudication workflow support is the remaining component in the OPM EPIC support for the entire lifecycle of the personnel security process both internally and for our customer agencies.  The system shall provide the ability to:
- Track the progress of personnel background investigation cases through intake, processing, adjudication, and approval phases including automated notifications to appropriate personnel when the case is ready for transfer.
- Provide customer agencies with configurable workflow and other customization potential (e.g., adding help materials, defining and adding reports, changing field labels or attributes).
- Provide a reliable and easily searchable database of status information on background investigations and adjudication actions.
- Provide reports out of the box and allow easy user configuration and development of reports from a non-proprietary database.
- Maintain separation of customer agency data in compliance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards.
- Process actions from user input. 
- Cancel an action based on employee input but retain information on each transaction in a history file.
- Provide confirmation of completed/successful actions with the opportunity to generate and send notification documentation to the subject; for example, that the background investigation has been completed and recorded. 
- Automatically generate documents used in the adjudication process.
- Leverage existing OPM data systems to pre-populate fields and feed OPM systems with completed adjudication results data.
- Accept OPM eDelivery of documents electronically and, where possible, be capable of electronically analyzing and processing documents to enhance adjudications office workload management.
- Provide automated assistance to case adjudications by automatically applying existing guidelines.
- Provide robust Help support from every screen and form at the field or topic level.
- Meet minimum system requirements as outlined in table
System Availability: The system shall be available 24 hours per day/7 days per week  exclusive of predetermined and managed down time not to exceed 4 hours weekly for maintenance.
Performance: The system shall provide real-time access to data via web-based interfaces.  The system will return information for a specific record requested by the user within one second.  Searches for data based on data values will be satisfied within three seconds, with appropriate indicators displayed to the user of search acceptance and progress.  Maintenance and enhancements to the system shall be applied without interruption to the user.
Reliability: All components of the system that the user is dependent upon shall be consistently accessible, provide real time information of data requested and provide consistent operational capabilities at all times. Updates, maintenance and enhancements shall be properly tested in a test environment that mirrors the production system to ensure seamless transition of updates and enhancements to the operational environment, providing consistent reliability of the system to the user at all times.
Scalability: The system shall be appropriately scalable to incorporate additional users across the federal government.
Security: The system shall conform to the requirements of the OPM application security certification and accreditation (C&A) process.  The system shall comply with Federal and OPM requirements for maintaining the privacy of personally identifiable information (PII). The system shall meet applicable NIST controls for a high system.  
Usability: System users shall be able to learn and use the system for its intended purpose with minimal training.
508 Compliance: Respondents to this RFI shall consider the specific Section 508 accessibility requirements detailed in 36 CFR part 1194.21.  Information content deliverables shall meet applicable accessibility requirements. 
Access: System shall be accessed via a web browser (Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.) and/or be integrated in OPMs EPIC Portal (Oracle WebCenter). Respondents to this RFI shall state which browsers are supported by their solutions.
Cloud Computing: Per OMBs recent IT Management Reform Plan (available at http://www.cio.gov/pages.cfm/page/White-House-Forum-on-IT-Management-Reform), the Federal government has a strategic preference for cloud-based solutions when procuring new IT systems. Respondents to this RFI shall state the degree to which their solutions are cloud-based, or if cloud options exist.
Open Source: OPM has an interest in deploying IT solutions that are entirely open source, or that contain open source components. Respondents shall state whether any components of their solutions are open source.
Integration: System shall integrate with OPM and EPIC architecture including but not limited to: use of IBM MQ broker for event handling between adjudication and other EPIC systems; use of well-formed XML for report delivery; ability to deploy on IBM Websphere or Oracle WebCenter. Respondents to this RFI shall state which RDBMS products are usable by their solutions.
The desired product will include the provision for the contractor to install and configure the application to operate in the OPM environment, or for provisioning the system in a cloud environment if applicable. To the extent currently supported, respondents should describe: the ability to use IBM WebSphere MQ Broker for event handling between adjudication and EPIC systems; the use of XML for data delivery and management; development language(s) used; the capability to deploy on IBM Websphere or Oracle WebCenter, if applicable; RDBMS supported and data standards utilized; workflow system used; any licensing requirements; use of Business Rules Management System; and integration potential with Corticon, if applicable.

<RESPDATE>032411

<CONTACT>Steven Santoro
<DESC>BLM Request for Proposals, L11PS00054, TECHNICAL REVIEW OF THE WILD HORSE AND BURRO PROGRAM. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Operations Center (NOC) intends to award a sole source contract to National Academy of Sciences, Office of Contracts & Grants, 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001 for the continuation of a study of the science, methodology, and technical decision-making approaches of the Wild Horse and Burro Program.  In evaluating the program, the study will build on findings of three prior reports prepared by the National Research Council (NRC) in 1980, 1982, and 1991 and summarize additional, relevant research completed since the three earlier reports were prepared.  Section 1333 of the 1971 Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act (WFRHBA) provides the BLM with the authority to consult with individuals independent of Federal and State government who have been recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, and other individuals determined to have scientific expertise and special knowledge of WH&B protection, wildlife management and animal husbandry as related to rangeland management.  The success of any strategy the BLM develops hinges on our ability to bridge the many divergent and conflicting perspectives about how the Wild Horse and Burro Program should be managed in the West.  These differences have led to an increasing number of appeals, litigation, congressional inquiries, and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.  Many feel the BLM is not credible and does not apply the best science in managing Americas Wild Horse & Burro Program.  The recommendations that the NAS provides would benefit the BLM as we continue to work closely with Congress, the public and our stakeholders to identify strategies for the future management of the Wild Horse and Burro Program in the West that enjoy broad-based support.
A cost-type contract is anticipated, with a delivery date of the final published report of no later than twenty-four months after award of a contract.  The contractor must gather data and provide reports that will address the following key scientific challenges:  Estimates of the WH&B populations; Population Modeling; Genetic diversity in Wild Horse and Burro herds; Annual rates of WH&B population growth; Predator impact on Wild Horse and Burro population growth; Population control; Immunocontraception of wild horse mares (porcine zona pellucida);   Managing a portion of a population as non-reproducing; AML Establishment or Adjustment; Societal Considerations; and Additional Research Needs. 
All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by the BLM. Send information for technical evaluation to Steve Santoro at (303) 236-3518 by March 24, 2011.  See Note 22.

<DESC>Title: National Automotive Sampling System (NASS)
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is charged with the responsibility of reducing the personal and property losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. Many sources of information are needed to permit researchers to adequately measure the characteristics of the highway safety environment. NHTSA's National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA) operates a system of crash research teams that provide:</p>
<p>1. Detailed nationally representative statistics on motor vehicle crashes.</p>
<p>2. A database for evaluation of standards and for countermeasures design.</p>
<p>In 1977, the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) was begun with contract awards to ten Primary Sampling Unit (PSU) research teams and two quality control Zone Center. The system grew to a complement of 50 PSUs and four Zone Center in 1981.</p>
<p>In 1986, the program was reviewed by NHTSA and other organizations to assess its usefulness, efficiency, and statistical precision. It was determined that modifications were needed in case selection, data set definition, and PSU strata distribution. As a result, in 1988, NASS was divided into two systems: Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) and General Estimates System (GES). CDS focused on the crashworthiness of passenger cars, light trucks, and vans involved in crashes and damaged enough to be towed. GES, on the other hand, collected limited data on other highway crashes in order to produce general estimates. From 1991 until 2010, CDS has included 24 PSUs located in 17 states with two quality control Zone Center. GES includes an additional 36 PSUs located in 9 additional states. All CDS and GES PSUs are currently established and functioning.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements:</p>
<p>Each PSU team collects certain information from traffic-police crash reports (PARs), which will be used to generate estimates of the nation's highway crash experience. Police reports that include passenger vehicles that are towed due to the severity of the damage and have a high potential for major injury will generally be selected for full investigation. The investigation of each case includes interviewing drivers and occupants, inspecting scenes and vehicles, reviewing official medical reports, and reconstructing crash dynamics. Crashworthiness information will be entered into electronic data files and subject to review by quality control contractors and NHTSA.</p>
<p>The contractor enters information from each investigation into an electronic file. Photographs are taken using digital cameras that allow the information to be readily entered into computers for storage and clinical review. After completion and quality review of all cases, NCSA prepares an annual analysis file for public use that includes case weighting factors. All personal identifiers are removed from electronic files to protect the privacy of the individuals involved. These NASS files, in conjunction with other data systems, provide the detailed and reliable information with which NHTSA and other motor vehicle research organizations can identify safety problems, monitor trends, assess proposed standards and countermeasures, and evaluate those already in effect.</p>
<p>Responsibility for operating the crash research teams, maintaining the quality of the field research data, and providing technical guidance for each PSU lies with the contractor-operated and maintained Zone Center. The Zone Center serves as the resource center providing the PSUs with expert technical guidance in crash investigation. The Zone Center closely monitors the performance of each PSU team in their zone as well as coordinating activities with the other zone center and NHTSA. They are a management link between NHTSA and the crash research teams assuming responsibility for field data collection, management, and quality assurance while NHTSA assumes overall, policy management. The Zone Center responsibility involves management of geographically distributed staff and requires experience in controlling field technical operations while interacting with NHTSA.</p>
<p>NHTSA plans to procure crash research, quality control, and technical guidance by contractor-operated and maintained Zone Center #2 for the Crashworthiness Data System and General Estimates System of NASS.</p>
<p>Contract Award: NHTSA anticipates issuing a Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee contract. The contract will result in a total possible performance period of five (5) years.</p>
<p>This solicitation is full and open competition.</p>
<p>Solicitation: The solicitation DTHN22-11-R-00431 will be available for downloading from http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ on or about April, 2011. All questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via e-mail to reba.dyer@nhtsa.dot.gov no later than April, 2011. The anticipated award date for this resultant contract is expected on or about July, 2011.</p>
