<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8) Machine-to-machine integration of mission planning and collection management systems across the Air Operations Centers (AOCs) and Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF-DCGS) sites</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9) Conduct gain/loss analysis for collection management</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10) Command and control of cyber forces and mission planning</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11) Operational level command and control capabilities (bridging strategic to tactical-unit level) to plan, coordinate, and execute non-kinetic capabilities with kinetic means to deliver synchronized global effects</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12) Provide systems engineering, integration, training and testing</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13) Interface with existing programs of record to obtain access to data sources (e.g. Air Operations Center Weapons System (AOC WS), Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF-DCGS), Global Command and Control System-Joint (GCCS-J), Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB), Command Post of the Future (CPOF)</p>
<p>There are two Focus Areas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Analytics for Situation Awareness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Data Framework and Core Services</p>
<p>Proposers may address all or parts of any of the two focus areas and must clearly indicate the technical area(s) being addressed in the white paper (see content and format section below). Teaming is highly encouraged. All performers under this BAA will be expected to work cooperatively with one another to develop, integrate, implement, test, and evaluate technical capabilities. Therefore, proposers should carefully review the expectations for all focus areas in order to fully understand the context of their own focus area.</p>
<p><strong>Focus Area Descriptions:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Area 1- Analytics for Situation Awareness</span></strong></p>
<p>Situation Awareness is defined as the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future. This BAA is immediately focused on researching and developing novel analytic techniques to accomplish situation awareness in the battlespace for perception, comprehension and projection. In order to achieve this goal, these analytics must be mission-focused and have a strong impetus towards creating a decision advantage.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Analytic Services:</strong> Analytic techniques can be wide ranging. This BAA is concentrated on a broad spectrum of analysis procedures to include, but is not limited to pattern analysis, spatial-temporal analysis, change detection, link analysis, social network analysis, and big data analytics. These analytic techniques must be developed as services made available in a plug and play, modular design.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Machine Learning:</strong> This BAA shall also provide cutting-edge machine learning capabilities to assist and automate user tasks. Potential applications include providing recommendations based on what data the user is interested in and has viewed, assisting with task management and the delegation of tasks, deriving alerts from patterns of life and indications and warnings, and learning and automating common user actions such as routine queries.</p>
<p><strong>Focus Area 2 - Data Framework and Core Services</strong></p>
<p>The data framework and core services are intended to provide the fundamental and essential components to develop an enterprise software system. This will serve as an overarching integration framework that will be responsible for interfacing with analytic services while providing required capabilities such as data access, security, and visualization services.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Infrastructure:</strong> Software infrastructure developed under this BAA shall provide a lightweight, open source Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) framework that is capable of facilitating the interaction and communication between services and other software applications in a service-oriented architecture. The ESB shall provide capabilities to integrate databases, services, and legacy systems and facilitate communication across disparate transport and messaging technologies. The infrastructure shall support a myriad of database systems to include, but not limited to document-oriented databases and NoSQL data stores. Lastly, the infrastructure shall be designed to serve as a platform as a service, as well as be interoperable with other third party services.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Data Framework Services:</strong> Proposers shall provide a data framework that is able to discover, model, connect, search and enter data across a variety of types and sources. For external data sources, this data framework shall extract, transform and load diverse data sources while performing data alignment and association to reduce and resolve duplicative entities that exist in multiple data sources. The system shall be able to search to find data across data types and sources. This search can be based on specific user-defined keywords, semantic search, and also faceted search. This search function shall leverage natural language processing techniques to ensure high precision and recall. The proposed system shall allow search results to be manipulated in a pivot table-like fashion which could update any graphic based on that data.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Security Services</strong>: The proposed system shall include a robust and flexible security framework. At a minimum, this shall contain: (1) policy-based access control and role-based access control (RBAC) that allows users access while also restricting system access only to authorized users. RBAC will control the roles assigned, allow authorized users to take on specific roles (e.g. administrator), and exercise permission. (2) The system shall also utilize single sign-on (SSO) authentication and public key infrastructure (PKI) for authenticating users that access the system. (3) Lastly, the system shall provide audit logs and the ability for system administrators to provide key system level metrics. Secure application development practices shall be followed to minimize rework required to comply with DoD Information Assurance (IA) policies. Software provided shall successfully pass various security vulnerability scans such as Fortify, Nessus, and Burp in order to achieve authority to operate on operational networks. Also, the security services shall appropriately mark data per classification standards (e.g. Controlled Access Program Coordination Office (CAPCO) markings).</p>
<p><strong>2.4 User Experience Services:</strong> This system shall provide end users with a fully customizable enterprise experience. For instance, customizable dashboards shall be available once users sign-in to the system. Dashboards can also be developed for use by a specific community. The dashboard will serve as the main interface for the system and must be fully customizable to allow operators to search and select the data they need to see once the system is accessed and provide user-specified information (specific to the user's AOR) on their requested display (e.g. map, graph). The user interface shall also allow users to share data, files, and notes and provide a collaborative social workspace. This workspace will permit users to save and share queries and working files, create target folders on entities of interest, and provide a user workflow for publishing reports and documents. The workflow will allow users to create, review, update and delete reports and rely on role-based access control for permissions. The user will also be able to export reports and records as appropriate. Lastly, the user experience and interface shall be reusable and domain agnostic.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Visualization Services</strong>: Users shall be able to access and visualize data through a myriad of methods. This BAA shall research how users interact with the user interface and develop novel visualization displays. Proposed approaches shall allow users to query the centralized database and output results to a diverse set of visualization displays. As data is selected, the visualization displays shall provide the full details on the data by displaying the data record. Typical displays include, but are not limited to table, report view, grid, graph, map (2D/3D, heatmap), timeline, and link analysis.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 Report Generator Services:</strong> Many times, users are required to develop a briefing or report to share and publish. The proposed approach shall provide a capability to automate this process, saving critical time that can be better spent analyzing data. This report generation capability shall allow users the ability to output their required data to different report types to include, but not limited to Microsoft PowerPoint, Excel, Word, and Adobe PDF.</p>
<p><strong>2.7 Mobile, Disconnected, and Disadvantaged Operations:</strong> The data framework and infrastructure designed and developed shall allow users to operate the software system from a mobile device. For users with little or no connectivity, the proposed approach shall allow users to still perform in an appropriate manner. Disconnected Operations shall allow users to have access to key capabilities of the system such as search and data entry with no connectivity. For disadvantaged users with little bandwidth, the system shall be able to execute in a lightweight manner so that users can still conduct critical functions.</p>

<p>a. CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE. All Proposers should review the NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM OPERATING MANUAL, (NISPOM), dated 28 February 2006 and incorporating Change 1, 28 March 2013, as it provides baseline standards for the protection of classified information and prescribes the requirements concerning Contractor Developed Information under paragraph 4-105. Defense Security Service (DSS) Site for the NISPOM is: http://www.dss.mil/.</p>
<p>In the event of a possible or actual compromise of classified information in the submission of your white paper or proposal, immediately but no later than 24 hours, bring this to the attention of your cognizant security authority and AFRL Rome Research Site Information Protection Office (IPO):</p>

Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. Offerors that intend to include classified information or data in their white paper submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>c. MAILING INSTRUCTIONS.

<p>Questions can be directed to the technical POC listed in Section VII.<br />4. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS/CONSIDERATIONS:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. COST SHARING OR MATCHING: Cost sharing is not a requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT (SAM). Offerors must be registered in the SAM database to receive a contract award, and remain registered during performance and through final payment of any contract or agreement. Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes forty-eight hours, should be taken into consideration when registering.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.

Any grant or agreement award resulting from this announcement may contain the award term set forth in 2 CFR, Appendix A to Part 25 which can be viewed at: <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=c55a4687d6faa13b137a26d0eb436edb&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view">http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=c55a4687d6faa13b137a26d0eb436edb&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view</a>=<br />text&amp;node=2:1.1.1.41&amp;idno=2#2:1.1.1.4.1.2.1.1</p>
<p>d. ALLOWABLE CHARGES: The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).</p>
<p>e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have a government approved accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). IMPORTANT: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in equal importance and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><br /><strong>VI. STEP TWO INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a><br /><br />2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TS/SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>
<p>This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.</p>
<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. <br />b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions apply:<br />(a) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk <br />(b) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>
<p><strong>6. GRANT AWARDS ONLY:</strong> For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publicly releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant. The DoD will publically post the abstract to comply with Section 8123 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235).</p>

<DESC>DLA Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to add 19 national stock numbers (NSNs) on the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (97499) corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, a long-term sole source contract which includes multiple NSNs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (BHTI) (97499) Legacy corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, in accordance with the initially approved J&amp;A; however, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort. The pricing for the national stock numbers will be for option Years 4 and 5 of the contract. The contract expiration date is 22 February 2017. The contract requires a supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB origin and inspection/acceptance at origin to DLA Direct stock locations. A total of 19 NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. It is anticipated that the total 19 NSNs will be priced for the award. The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., CAGE 97499.
<p><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites must provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by Thursday, November 25, 2015. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil).</p>
<p><br />Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached 19 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. The Letter RFP issue date is Friday, November 27, 2015. The anticipated closing date is Monday, December 28, 2015.</p>

<SOLNBR>W91CRB-16-DOTE-APS
<RESPDATE>120315
<CONTACT>Daria R. Stafford, Phone 571-256-4018, Email daria.r.stafford.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The Senate Committee Report 114-49 directs "that the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, supported by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and in consultation with the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology, conduct a comprehensive market survey to assess, to the extent practical, the current state of the art with respect to active protection systems for armored and tactical vehicle." In anticipation of the FY16 NDAA maintaining the directive, the Department is initiating the market survey at this time to prepare for an assessment of available APS and related technologies. <br /><br />This market survey is intended to determine the availability and development status of APS technologies capable of detecting, tracking, engaging and defeating threats, as well as their ability to be integrated onto U.S. ground combat and tactical vehicles. The Department of Defense will investigate fully operational APS that are currently integrated onto platforms and fielded; advanced prototype systems of sufficient technological readiness, such that they have completed or are in the process of completing operational testing; and any advanced emerging APS technology that can be made operational in a relatively short time frame. Along with integrating a complete solution for a particular vehicle or threat scenario, the envisioned system will be evaluated to determine 1) its ability to be installed and integrated, in the near term, on a variety of ground vehicles and 2) its capability against operationally relevant threats across a range of engagement conditions. The compatibility across fire control, sensors, countermeasures, and related items of equipment necessary for employment is foremost such that integrated suites can be deployed on present and future vehicles. The intent of this RFI is to determine the technical maturity and operational readiness of available APS for possible future test demonstrations. This would require the complete APS to be integrated onto demonstrator vehicle(s) and subjected to threats employed at realistic engagement conditions. The information gathered will be used by the Department of Defense, in conjunction with the Services, to inform considerations and requirements for the development, integration, test and fielding of APS for ground combat and tactical vehicles. <br /><br />Background<br />APS technology has been matured for other military applications, but it has yet to reach DOD ground vehicles in an effective capacity. DoD is investigating available and emerging technologies to make informed and data-based decisions on future investments to quickly field effective and suitable APS for ground combat and tactical vehicles. System effectiveness, suitability, collateral damage/hazards, manufacturability, modularity, etc are all important factors when considering the potential fielding of APS in the future. <br /><br />Topics of Interest<br />We are specifically seeking input on the following topics:<br />&bull; Identification of the potential merits, limitations, and operational costs associated with fielding APS to units in the United States military forces.<br />&bull; Identification and assessment of countermeasures to and operational limitations of active protection systems.<br />&bull; Analysis of collateral damage potential of active protection systems.<br />&bull; Identification and assessment of emerging direct-fire and top-attack threats to defense systems that could potentially deploy active protection systems.<br />&bull; Identification and assessment of existing and emerging APS requirements.<br />In addressing these elements, respondents will be encouraged to provide specific information on matters such as:<br />&bull; Detailed design of system proposed.<br />&bull; Performance data from operations and field/developmental tests, to include descriptions of engagement or test conditions.<br />&bull; Collateral damage to host platforms and occupants, given successful defeat (and non-defeat) of threat munitions, as well as collateral hazards to personnel and vehicles (military and civilian) operating in proximity to an APS-equipped vehicle.<br />&bull; Electromagnetic vulnerability, hazards of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance, and hazards of electromagnetic radiation to personnel.<br />&bull; Use of automated soft-kill or counter-firing systems that act in concert with hard-kill APS to increase overall vehicle or unit survivability. <br />&bull; Vehicle interior blast overpressures, required levels of debris protection (given successful defeat and non-defeat of threat munitions), and other crew safety and vehicle survivability concerns.<br />&bull; APS operational concepts and environmental limitations (rain, night, fog, dust, etc.).<br />&bull; Cost and schedule assessments (including testing and vehicle integration costs and schedules) leading to earliest possible demonstration and deployment of their systems (and the information that provides the basis for such assessments).<br />&bull; Any additional information that is deemed relevant for this assessment <br /><br />Response<br />Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper. This submission shall be limited to 25 pages in length. Submission of proprietary and other sensitive information shall be marked and identified with disposition instructions (submitted material will not be returned). The responses shall include, but not be limited to: (a) a one page summary of the party's experience with active protection system technology, (b) a detailed description of the party's detection, tracking, and cueing sensor technology solutions, and engagement/munition solution that will be capable of being integrated on to a ground vehicle demonstrator, (c) description of tests conducted to date and associated results (d) evidence of operational readiness, or what investment would be required to make the solution operational (e) description of the cost and schedule necessary to integrate the APS for test. The Department will review the submitted responses and may schedule further discussions with responding vendors. Responders will be contacted individually. <br />All information is requested within twenty-one (21) days of announcement on paper or closed session compact disc. You may forward responses to: <br /><br />Office of the Secretary of Defense <br />Office of the Director, Operational Test &amp; Evaluation <br />Live Fire Test and Evaluation <br />1700 Defense Pentagon 1D548<br />Washington, DC 20301<br />ATTN: Ms. Daria Stafford <br /><br />Questions may be sent to: daria.r.stafford.civ@mail.mil. If you choose to submit proprietary information, please mark it accordingly. Classified information will be accepted by mail only; please mark it accordingly and send it via proper channels. Responses submitted by contractors that contain U.S. classified military information (CMI) generated in conjunction with a DOD program should be classified in accordance with the applicable Security Classification Guide (SCG). Please include a copy of the SCG with the submission. Responses submitted that contain information classified by a foreign government (e.g. Canadian SECRET), should be handled with the same security procedures as U.S. CMI. If the security classification of the foreign government document is shown in English, no other classification marking will be applied. If the classification is not shown in English, the equivalent U.S. classification designation will be marked conspicuously on the document.

<DESC>Sources Sought <br> THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY and an ANNOUNCMENT FOR AN INDUSTRY DAY <br> Request for Information (RFI) <br> Sources Sought, Corporate Capability Statements, Draft Performance Work Statements (PWS) and Industry Day Announcement <br> RFI Overview:  The Army Contracting Command-Redstone (ACC-Redstone) is seeking information concerning the interest and availability of capable contractors to provide contract support to the Aviation and Missile Command's (AMCOM) aviation maintenance programs.  This is the initial market research for the upcoming follow-on programs.  As a result, no firm plan or strategy is in place at this time.  The potential requirements covered by this RFI will include the following: <br> a.  AMCOM Aviation Field Maintenance (AFM) Contract:  This contract will provide for field and sustainment maintenance for rotary wing Army aviation platforms in support of the mission area managed or supported by AMCOM.  It is anticipated the contract will require the contractor to accomplish the following: maintenance of Army Aviation aircraft to potentially include RESET, or similar programs, in accordance with established Technical Bulletins and Directives, the installation of Modification Work Orders (MWOs), support to installation aviation activities, and support to Combat Aviation Brigades (CAB).  Reference Attachment 0001 DRAFT AFM CONUS and Attachment 0002 AFM OCONUS PWSs that provide potential scope to be performed. <br> b.  Ft. Rucker Aviation Maintenance Services Contract:  Contracted services will maintain and provide safe, functional helicopters to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command's (TRADOC) flight school training program through the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) as well as to support the Air Force's 23rd Flight Training Squadron (FTS), the US Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), the National Maintenance Program, and other minor requirements.  Reference Attachment 0003 Army ACLC Draft PWS, Attachment 0004 Air Force DRAFT PWS for potential scope, and Attachment 0005 Draft Incentive Fee Criteria.    <br> Contract Background and Anticipated Period of Performance:  It is anticipated that the AFM contract will take the form of either an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract or a base year contract with options.  It is anticipated that the Ft. Rucker contract will consist of a base year and options.  Successful offerors for both programs, AFM and Ft. Rucker, will be determined on a best value approach.  It is anticipated that all contracts will include the minimum of a seven year period of performance.  It is anticipated that both the AFM and Ft. Rucker efforts will include a hybrid contract type and potentially incentives.  The hybrid contracts could include both fixed and cost type arrangements.  The location of the effort to be performed by the AFM requirement will be both in the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).  It is contemplated that a regional approach will be utilized for the AFM effort.  Each region will include maintenance sites that could easily change as the operational requirements evolve.  The Ft. Rucker requirements will primarily take place at Ft. Rucker, Al.  Both the AFM and Ft. Rucker requirements are considered services with the appropriate services laws and regulations being applicable.  All contracts awarded will include the Ground and Flight Risk clause and will require a higher level of quality requirements to potentially include Aerospace Standard 9110 (current version).  It is anticipated that North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 488190, Other Support Activities for Air Transportation, will apply.  The current standard is $32.5M.   <br> Sources Sought:  The ACC-Redstone would like to identify businesses that have experience in all or a part of the requirements described above and in the attached PWSs.  Please provide a statement as to your company's name and if you have tentative plans to propose on one or both of the programs as a prime, or if you are looking for subcontractor opportunities only.  In addition, ideas as to contract types, the structure of the contract, how to incentivize exceptional quality and/or performance are requested.  Ideas on how to streamline the proposal generation process is also being solicited.  Note that any actual requirement(s) will eventually be announced through FedBizOpps.   <br> Corporate Capability Statements:  It is requested that interested parties provide a Corporate Capability Statement that reflects their potential to fulfill the Government's requirements.  A desire of the Government is that the Corporate Capability Statement cover letter also include details related to the size of the company based on the anticipated NAICS code of 488190.  Specifically the letter should address if the business is a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, Woman-Owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned, Serviced Disabled Veteran, etc.   <br> Performance Work Statements (PWS):  Interested contractors are requested to review the accompanying DRAFT PWS for the AFM and Ft. Rucker efforts and respond to the contracting officer point of contact (POC) with any comments, innovative ideas, performance or quality incentives and measurements, best industry practices, or acquisition streamlining that might enhance the PWS or the aviation maintenance services programs.  Please note that these are overarching DRAFT PWSs that describe the mission areas and a description of the type of work.  They will change as requirements are better identified and acquisition strategies are developed.    <br> Industry Day:  An industry day related to these acquisitions is to take place in Huntsville, Al. at the Jackson Center, located at 600 Genome Way, Huntsville, Al 35806, on Thursday, March 12, 2015.  Due to limited seating, it is requested that attendance be limited to two individuals from any one company.  Separate briefings will be held for each of the proposed actions described above.  The AFM brief will take place at 8:30 A.M., CST.  The Ft. Rucker brief will immediately follow.    <br>  <br> This RFI pertains to sources sought, corporate capability statements to include any suggestions related to contract incentive, requirement generation or proposal submission streamlining, DRAFT PWSs information, and an Industry Day announcement.  This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government.  Any formal solicitation(s) will be announced separately.  It is anticipated that a draft solicitation for industry's comments may be released in the fourth quarter of Calendar Year (CY) 2015 for the AFM effort and the first quarter of CY 2016 for the Ft. Rucker effort.  However, these dates are estimates and subject to change without notice.  The Government is anticipating awarding multiple contracts for the AFM effort and one contract for the Ft. Rucker effort.  Source Selection will be conducted per applicable guidance of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15 and supplemental guidance.  Note that only comments are solicited under this RFI.  No questions will be entertained.  Send all comments relating to the DRAFT PWS or cost incentive ideas to the listed Contracting Officer POC.  Contacts to Government personnel by potential offerors regarding this RFI subject are restricted and must proceed through the Contracting Officer POC.  The Contracting Officer, Mr. Zac York, has posted all current information regarding this requirement on the FedBizOpps website.  Solicitation numbers are W58RGZ-16-R-0006 for the AFM effort and W58RGZ-16-R-0005 for the Ft. Rucker effort.  Information includes DRAFT PWSs as well as directions to the Jackson Center.

AMDWS is the Force Operations (FO) component of the Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) and the Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell providing both planning and Situational Awareness of Air Defense assets.</p>
<p>This notice is published in accordance with FAR Parts 10.002 and 15.201 and is a Request for Information (RFI) only in support of market research. All information received will be used for planning purposes only. This notice does not constitute Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, or Request for Quotes. The Government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it.</p>
<p>PROBLEM STATEMENT: AMDWS is the Air Defense component for AMDPCS, ADAM Cell, and Army Mission Command (MC). AMDWS is also the gateway between the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Force and the Maneuver Commander. Interoperability with MC, Joint and Multinational systems will be maintained and extended to enable collaborative planning and situational awareness through tactical graphics and staff element overlays. The U.S. Army will update AMDWS with regulatory changes required to maintain interoperability with the Air Operations Center (AOC) and the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC). The AMDWS system will retrieve, fuse, and distribute this time-sensitive information to support operator inputs necessary for decision cycle dominance at all AMD Echelons. The AMDWS user interface will enable display of the near real time situation to allow the primary FO mission of monitoring the situation, assessing the situation, conducting planning, and directing and controlling forces to be performed easily. The fusion of the current Battlespace picture on AMDWS is an enabler as the primary Common Operating Picture (COP) within the ADAM Cell, AMDPCS, and Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). The AMDWS operates at SECRET classification level and requires compliance with the DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP).</p>
<p>The U.S. Army seeks to maintain the current AMDWS capability set as well as provide enhancements to meet emerging requirements. Any candidate solution must meet the following AMDWS capability set:</p>
<p>1) Disseminate integrated Air Picture sourced from Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD), Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI), Self-Reporters, and Blue Force Tracker (BFT) - A.

<DESC>Synopsis:
Please note that this is NOT a request for quotes or proposals. The Government is seeking information for market research purposes only. The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 3, Network Contracting Office 3 (10N3NCO) is currently conducting a market survey for firms capable of providing the following service: 

STATEMENT OF WORK
Title of Project:  National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI).
Background: The Northport VA Medical Center's Department of Nursing uses a Nursing Quality Control Indicator and Feedback program to measure itself against similar size facilities and find ways to improve, patient care, patient safety and quality of care that affect the day to day operation in the nursing care environment of the VA Medical Center.
Nursing Quality Control Indicator and Feedback (NQCIF) provides a quarterly information stream that includes national comparison data for facilities like ours. The NQCIF data allow staff nurses and nursing leadership the opportunity to review their data and evaluate nursing performance relative to patient outcomes. Your facility can use the information to establish organizational goals for improvement at the unit level. You can mark your progress in improving the care of patients and the work environment of nurses, avoid costly complications, and assist in marketing the quality of your efforts.
Patient outcome and nurse staffing data are currently collected on adult and pediatric critical care; step down, medical, surgical, medical/surgical, and psychiatric and rehabilitation. RN turnover data are now available for unit types ED, peri-operative, and obstetrics.
Once the data collection period has ended and we have received our facility's information, we will receive our report, including comparison data and analysis, within six weeks.
Collaboration has been a key component in the successful growth of and development of the VA Nursing Staff. Participants can be part of the development process by pilot testing a new indicator and in validity and reliability studies.
The program offers the ability to trend data over multiple quarters instead of an isolated, and perhaps misleading, snapshot of performance.
The program offers VA staff tools to assist with efforts to address the needs of our staff, improving their work environment as well as retention and recruitment. Program participants have stated that this survey alone is worth the fee.
Scope of Work: Membership to the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI). Membership access does not involve the purchase of software from the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators. The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in this statement of work (SOW), except as may otherwise be specified. NDNQI provides a quarterly information stream that includes national comparison data for facilities like Veterans Health Administration of New York and New Jersey VISN 3. The NDNQI data allows staff nurses and nursing leadership the opportunity to review their data and evaluate nursing performance relative to patient outcomes.
Access to comprehensive online tutorial's for each indicator, program liaisons and quarterly conference calls. A quarterly newsletter is also provided to all participating facilities providing program updates. In addition to ongoing training on the indicators and the database, a continuing education credit is available from program training modules including one on pressure ulcer identification, staging, and sourcing.
The program requires a secure, user-friendly website for member data entry. No software purchase is necessary. XML data files should be accepted.
Type of Contract: Firm-Fixed Price (FFP).
Performance Period: Annual membership period is one-year. It includes four option years

<p>Background: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.</p>
<p>The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a translational science center that prides itself on its tremendously productive pipeline and is innovative in a number of ways. First, our quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) paradigm, which tests all compounds at multiple concentrations in the primary screen, is unique. Second, NCATS is distinctive in its focus on collaboration with outside investigators to produce high-quality chemical probes to define and assess new biology. This focus is reflected in our unprecedented outreach program, which reaches hundreds of potential new investigators every year, and accounts for much of the new science being done at the NCATS. Third, NCATS is uniquely focused on new technologies and paradigms to improve the process of translational science, typified by qHTS, our informatics platform, our utilization of structural biology to accelerate probe development, development of new synthetic and analytical chemistry paradigms.  Ultimately, NCATS brings together a diverse range of scientists, including medicinal chemists, biologists, toxicologists, and engineers, in order to ultimately translate basic science into real products and services that help improve people's lives. Included in this process is the development of unique biological discoveries into potential pharmaceuticals which can greatly assist patients.</p>

<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is constructing a Memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower in Washington DC. The four acre project site is located one block from the National Mall. The design includes two Bas Reliefs carved in stone. The reliefs are part of a larger stone clad element that also includes inscriptions and a platform for bronze sculptures. The bas reliefs form a background to a grouping of bronze sculptures. This sources sought is specific to the fabrication and installation of the carved stone bas relief portion only.</p>
<p>Each bas relief is 12' high x 36' long and the stone thickness being contemplated is approximately 10". The relief is broken into smaller size panels which will be anchored to a structural concrete substrate behind the bas relief wall. The stone relief will be carved to match an artist's concept maquette. The stone carving fabrication will require collaboration with the artist for the reliefs. It is anticipated that the fabrication of the bas reliefs will require a combination of mechanical and hand carving techniques to meet the design intent.</p>
<p>A potential offeror must have the ability to:<br />a. Provide high quality stone carved art for a Presidential Memorial<br />b. Participate in the stone selection, along with the architect, artist and other stakeholders<br />c. Provide large scale carved mockups for aesthetic evaluation<br />d. Provide dimensioned drawings coordinated with adjacent construction<br />e. Engineer stone anchoring system to support the carved stone bas relief panels.<br />f. Install bas reliefs on site in coordination with adjacent construction<br />g. Provide typical ASTM and other stone testing analysis</p>
<p>GSA is anticipating awarding a best value, firm fixed price contract for the construction of the entire memorial. The stone is a specified item included within the overall project scope, and is not a stand-alone procurement.</p>
<p>The Government will review each response and will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis for determining whether there exists reasonable expectation of obtaining a sufficient number of offers that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery. A determination not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All information furnished to the Government in response to this notice will be used for review purposes only.</p>
<p>This market research is being conducted under North American Industrial Classification System Code 327991. The small business size standard for this NAICS code is 500 in number of employees.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard SFLC IBCT Product Line is seeking qualified sources for:
<p>Repair and/or purchase of an indefinite quantity of Turbochargers, Napier part number 3GS73B123FJ and Turbo Cartridges, Napier part number 3GS/DJ to maintain adequate warehouse stocking levels to support Major Maintenance Availabilities of WLB-225 "B" class buoy tenders. It is anticipated that an eventual contract period of performance will consist of one (1) base year and four (4) option years. It is estimated that up to one defective turbocharger and one defective turbo cartridge will be submitted each year for inspection and overhaul/repair. Exact quantities will depend on the cutter availabilities, individual cutter needs, and SFLC warehouse inventory levels.</p>
<p>The requirement is for turbochargers and turbo cartridges to support geographically dispersed WLB-225 "B" class buoy tenders. These parts are designed to conform to, and mate with, the Caterpillar 3608 Main Propulsion Diesel Engine.</p>
<p>The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for this Procurement is:</p>
<p>Napier Turbochargers Limited<br />Ruston House<br />PO Box 1<br />Waterside South<br />Lincoln, LN5 7FD<br />United Kingdom</p>
<p>The known authorized Napier Turbocharger distributor for the United States is:</p>
<p>Motor Services Hugo Stamp, Inc.<br />3190 SW 4th Ave.<br />Fort Lauderdale, FL 33315</p>
<p>The Government will furnish defective turbochargers and turbo cartridges to the Contractor for overhaul. In the event a unit inducted for overhaul is deemed beyond economical repair (BER), an option will be exercised to purchase a new unit of the same type. The option to purchase new may also be exercised when defective units are not available to be inducted for repair, but new units are required to maintain adequate warehouse stocking levels.</p>
<p>Also see attached draft specification, requirement item listing, and delivery dates for each item.</p>
<p>Applicable NAICS codes include: 336611 -- Ship Building and Repairing, 333618, Other Engine Equipment Manufacturing, 333612, Speed Changer, Industrial High-Speed Drive, and Gear Manufacturing</p>
<p>The information obtained from this notice is for market research only. It is the Government's belief that only the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Napier Turbochargers Limited, and/or its authorized distributors can provide the required parts to ensure proper form, fit and function of all its components. However, other sources who believe they have the necessary expertise and technical data to meet the above requirement may submit statements of capability for consideration.</p>
<p>Interested parties must submit the following:</p>
<p>(a) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate capability to accomplish the work/overhaul and documentation noting capability to furnish the required OEM parts.</p>
<p>(b) Past performance information to demonstrate successful completion of contracts providing the above work. Include contract numbers, item description, dollar amount, references with email addresses and telephone numbers.</p>
<p>Responses are due by 4:30 pm Pacific time, November 23, 2015</p>

Dave Lambillotte Consulting (DLC) will produce a quantity of 455 custom built ELISA test kits for the detection of anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in human serum using antigen (TgERP) and human anti- serum provided by the USDA. U.S. Dept. of Agriculure holds the Patent number: US-7544789-B1 for DNA encoding Toxoplasma rDGP5p protein. North American Industrial Classification Code ( NAICS) Code is: 541711. ELISA test results can vary widely when using tests produced by different manufacturers. Since all previous production of the kits using the patented antigen and all publications relating to the antigen have used the Dave Lambilotte Constulting supplied kits, it is important for comparative purposes to continue to use the same manufacturer. David Lambillotte is the current owner of SafePath Laboratories. SafePath Laboratories no longer produces Toxoplasma kits. Custom kit manufacturing are now provided exclusively by Dave Lambillotte Consulting, Inc. Once the antigen and antibodys are shipped by U.S. Dept. of Agriculture to Dave Lambillotte Consulting,Inc. (DLC), DLC will use proprietary methods to bind the TgERP to polystyrene plates at a specific concentrations, and using positive human serum provided by ARS, appropriate dilution values will be determined for antigen and serum. DLC will validate test performance, including sensitivity and specificity of the test. (DLC) will provide all necessary components for the test kit, pre-coated ELISA plates, serum diluent, plate washing buffer, substrate solutions, 2nd step antibody, and stop buffer, and positive and negative controls. All completed kits will be shipped by January 15th, 2016. No other kits are compatible<br />

<DESC><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), in Beltsville, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract with Kenneth W. Vick, 13625 SW 89 Terrace, Archer, FL 32618-4308, to provide advice, counsel, and assistance to the ARS and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Senior Management, as well as to the USDA Office of the Secretary and senior leadership at the US Environmental Protection Agency and State Department, on issues related to the methyl bromide phase-out, methyl bromide alternatives and methyl bromide alternatives research program, Montreal Protocol, and the use of methyl bromide for quarantine and preshipment (QPS) uses. Services will include interaction with ARS scientists working in the National Program 308, Methyl Bromide Alternatives Research Program, as well as customers, stakeholders, and partners impacted by regulatory actions taken regarding methyl bromide. Services will include attending Montreal Protocol meetings and meetings of the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee. The contractor will provide advice and counsel to these committees relative to methyl bromide postharvest and quarantine issues. These committees make recommendations to the member countries to the Protocol.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is estimated the contractor will travel to three international meetings during the 12 month contract (Argentina and two additional foreign countries to be determined at a later date). The completion of services for report preparation is not to exceed 120 hours.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">The circumstance permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1 and 41 USC 253(c)(5), only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or source will meet agency needs. Dr. Vick is the only contractor with the scientific and quarantine experience and international stature along with longstanding membership on the Montreal Protocol MBTOC and QPS to effectively discharge the responsibilities of this contract. Dr. Vick has more than 19 years experience leading the ARS research program dealing with methyl bromide and quarantine issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He has been the State Department nominee to the Montreal Protocol Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee since the committee's inception in 1992.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More recently, he was the APHIS/ARS/State Department nominee to the Montreal Protocol Quarantine/Preshipment (QPS/Preshipment) Taskforce at that committee's inception in 2005. He has participated on over 20 trade negotiation teams involving commodity treatments, especially, methyl bromide, to remove quarantine barriers to export of U.S.-produced commodities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He has led the ARS program for over 19 years that has developed many alternative commodity treatments that have replaced the stratospheric ozone depletory, methyl bromide. Dr. Vick is the only contractor qualified for this assignment since he has unique and detailed knowledge of national and international research programs on methyl bromide alternatives, extensive involvement with international community in the regulation of methyl bromide and broad knowledge of quarantine/preshipment uses of methyl bromide and the real-world effect that regulation of QPS methyl bromide would have.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His knowledge and expertise will satisfy the Agency's and Department's need of effective representation on international technical committees related to methyl bromide and for immediate expert advice and counsel related to methyl bromide policy matters.</p>

This specific program is the only one like this within the community.    There were no like programs discovered during market research.  
Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  This is NOT an RFQ.  This does represent the Government's only written notice of this procurement.

The estimated/potential $6,000.00

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT FOR PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 3, James J. Peters VA Medical Center, Bronx New York, intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C 253(c) (1) - FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to LJM Engineering Group INC, 439 US Highway 46 STE, Rockway, NJ 07866-3631.  LJM Engineering Group is to complete the remaining 10% of the design of the animal research lab portion of the project and furnish all necessary labor to provide construction period services (CPS)
Place of performance:
VA  Brooklyn Campus 800 Poly Place, Brooklyn, NY 11208

Period of Performance:
The period of performance is Three Hundred and Sixty Five (365) calendar days from award notice.


This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; interested parties may express their interest by providing a capabilities statement no later than NOV 20, 2015, at 1:00 PM EST. The capabilities statement must provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate the capability of the party to provide the required services.   A determination not to compete this proposed contract upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered.  If after NOV 20, 2015, at 1:00 PM EST, no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement, Department of Veterans Affairs shall negotiate solely with LJM Engineering Group INC.  

The government believes that the below described services (please see the SOW) cannot be provided by another firm within a timely and practical manner.  LJM Engineering Group INC has been preforming the AE services for this project, but the design funds expired as of 09/30/2015 due to the construction delay.  The VA needs to continue with this project, and LJM Engineering Group INC has unique capabilities to provide the government's requirement within a timely and practical manner.  The government believes that it would be highly unusual for another design professional to take on the aforementioned responsibilities, which are generally incidental to an overall agreement for preparation of plans and specification.  

This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive quotes. There will be no solicitation available for competitive quotes. Phone calls will not be accepted. 
The point of contact for this action is Phillip Kang, Contract Specialist @ Phillip.kang@va.gov

12)	The A/E shall make visits to the Project site, observe the construction and advise the Contracting Officer's Representative of any deviations or deficiencies.

13)	The A/E shall upon substantial completion of construction provide a "Punch List" of deficient construction items to the VA.

Tips for Getting Past the Gatekeeper panel addresses how to get the initial appointment and offers various methods from several agency OSDBU Directors for getting through to the decision makers.</p>
<p>The Technical Proposal - What makes a good proposal? One attribute is appearance. A strong proposal has an attractive, professional, inviting appearance. In addition, the information should easy to access. A second attribute is substance. A strong proposal has a well-organized plan of attack. A strong proposal also has technical details because technical depth is needed to sell your project. The Technical Proposal panel consists of Contracting Officer Representatives that will provide insight on the strength and weaknesses found in technical proposals from small businesses.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012 (a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor. (b) Inclue the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns. (c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act. <BR> <BR>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the retired primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. "Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means- (1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service to identify a commercial or Government entity; or (2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLA records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code." "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. "Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. "Registered in the SAM database" means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; (2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and (3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes. It includes- (1) Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government; (2) Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and (3) The list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office. (b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4. (3) If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM. (c) If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) A contractor may obtain a DUNS number- (i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business name. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code. (iv) Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company telephone number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) Reserved. (e) Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering. Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing. <BR> <BR>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to- (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)
(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.    (b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.    Solicitation:

Salient Characteristics:

The Edwards Physio Annuloplasty Ring is made of layers of Elgiloy and plastic strips and has a sewing ring margin that consists of a layer of silicone rubber covered by a polyester knit fabric. The rings are provided on holders, sterile and nonpyrogenic in plastic trays. For resterilization by steam, the rings must be removed from the original package and transferred to a suitable container. The reusable handle is provided non-sterile and may be sterilized by steam. 

This ring offers the security of a proven design based on forty years of experience in mitral valve reconstruction. Integrating fifteen years of new learning about mitral valve anatomy and physiology, the next generation Edwards Physio Annuloplasty Ring helps surgeons repair without limits.

o	Global shape optimization: evolves from the native D-shape to a more circular shape to accommodate the pathological changes in mitral annular dimensions. 
o	Double saddle configuration: maximizes the distribution of stress across the reconstructed mitral valve
o	Designed by surgeons to improve the implant experience. 
o	True sewing cuff design offers a 40% improvement in sewing margin.
o	An easy-to-access, single-cut removal offers quick ring detachment from the holder. 
o	Angled holder improves visualization and line-of-sight to the mitral valve. 
o	Windows on the holder permit direct visualization of the repaired coaptation line.
o	Proven design offers remodeling with flexibility. 
o	Based on over 100,000 implants of the Edwards Physio Annuloplasty Ring
o	Clinical efficacy demonstrated by 7,000 published patient-years
o	Single-piece sizer designed to optimize ease of use 
o	Extended length handle provides optimal access in MIS or traditional procedures 
o	Ergonomic grip enhances sizer handling

?
Remodeling

o 	Preserves natural 3:4 ratio between the anteroposterior diameter and transverse
diameter during systole
o 	Restores anatomical size & shape to provide optimal orifice area
Progressive Posterior Flexibility
o 	Variable flexibility is created by the movement of Elgiloy* bands separated
by plastic bands
o 	Allows for physiologic contractility of the mitral valve annulus during systole
o	      Minimizes stresses on sutures

<DESC>Background and Description: <br /><br />The DSO, which is a part of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), is a recognized center of excellence for DoD spectrum matters. One of DSO's missions is to provide spectrum and Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) engineering and analysis support services on a reimbursable, customer-funded basis to DoD Components, federal agencies, non-federal government organizations, and to foreign entities when authorized by the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), or the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. <br /><br />Engineering support related to spectrum operations are an integral part of the overall information battlespace.

Management of elements include:<br />&bull; Planning<br />&bull; Execution<br />&bull; Communications <br />&bull; Monitoring (e.g., periodic reviews, testing)<br />&bull; Adjustments<br />&bull; Delivery and acceptance criteria<br /><br />This contract will provide technical support to DSO for the following tasks:<br /><br />a. E3 and Spectrum Engineering - analyzing equipment and systems for potential E3 problems and recommending solutions.<br /><br />Contract Type: The Government contemplates award of a single-award indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed-price and cost type CLINs contract resulting from this solicitation.<br /><br />Competition: This solicitation is a Total Small Business Set aside.<br /><br />The requisite NAICS code for the acquisition is 541330.

<DESC>Classification Code: D - Information technology services, including telecommunications services
<p>The solicitation number is HSTS05-16-Q-ACQ002. The solicitation is issued as a Request for<br />Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Evaluation of Offers, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and all incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through<br />Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-83, effective November 1, 2015.</p>
<p>This is a total small business set-aside. The associated North American Classification System<br />(NAICS) code is 454112 and the small business size standard is $38.5 million in average annual<br />receipts.</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Office of Acquisition, intends to establish a base period with four (4) one-year options contract for a web-based reverse auctioning tool. TSA expects to make one award from this synopsis/solicitation in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting Competition; Evaluation of Quotations or Offers; and Award and Documentation.</p>
<p>1. SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires an existing web-based solution that assists the procurement office and customers in soliciting, evaluating, and awarding multiple contract types for supplies and select services from established networks of vendors. In FY15 TSA processed 22 actions through reverse auction, for a total award price of approximately $1.2 million.</p>
<p>A. Quoter shall provide in their quote the number of vendors that are registered in their system and able to provide quotes.</p>
<p>B. TSA requires a solution that is vendor paid (awarded vendor pays fee to the company), and not a licensing agreement model. Quoter shall provide in their quote either the percentage range or average fee, or the fixed dollar amount, if applicable.</p>
<p><br />Reverse Auction Functional Requirements:</p>
<p>The web-enabled reverse auctioning tool shall permit TSA procurement personnel, which includes both federal and contractor employees, to conduct real-time competed auctions for supplies and services. The tool allows employees to post online reverse auctions formatted as Request for Quotations (RFQs), utilize best value award criteria, Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) award criteria, and establish auction start and end times. The system shall be versatile to allow buyers to have complete and independent control of the bidding process to post auctions, modify auctions, cancel auctions at any time if it is in the best interest of the Government, and award to any vendor providing a quote in accordance with the established evaluation criteria. The reverse auction system website must be capable of simultaneous transactions in support of up to approximately 120 users (buyers) creating and conducting numerous auctions among various vendors for a multitude of items and services.</p>
<p>The reverse auction tool shall also be capable of registering eligible vendors within the tool to be able to receive auctions and submit quotes to the Government. Vendors shall also be able to submit questions directly to the buyer regarding the RFQ; the contracting staff shall also be able to respond to one or all Quoters with answers to questions and comments to statements.</p>
<p>The reverse auction tool shall also be capable of delivering reporting data so that TSA can track spend and savings data for procurements completed using the tool. Some reporting that might be required or requested includes, but is not limited to, number of auctions by buyer-component-contract, number of bidders, number of bids and spend-savings calculations.</p>

<p>Discounts offered after invoice submission. If the Contractor should wish to offer a discount on a specific invoice after its submission for payment, the Contractor should submit a letter to the Finance Center identifying the specific invoice for which a discount is offered and specify the exact terms of the discount offered and what time period the Government should make payment by in order to receive the discount. The Contractor should clearly indicate the contract number, invoice number and date, and the specific terms of the discount offered.

<p>(f) Supplemental Invoice Documentation: Contractors shall submit all supplemental invoice documentation (e.g. copies of subcontractor invoices, travel vouchers, etc.) necessary to approve an invoice along with the original invoice. The Contractor invoice must contain the information stated in the Prompt Payment Clause in order to be received and processed by FinCen. Supplemental invoice documentation required for review and approval of invoices may, at the written direction of the Contracting Officer, be submitted directly to either the Contracting Officer, or the Contracting Officer's Representative. Note for "time-and-material" type contracts: The Contractor must submit the following statement with each invoice for labor hours invoiced under a "time-and-materials" type contract, order, or contract line item: "The Contractor hereby certifies in accordance with paragraph (c) of FAR 52.232-7, that each labor hour has been performed by an employee (prime or subcontractor) who meets the contract's specified requirements for the labor category invoiced."</p>

<p>(h) Frequency of Invoice Submission. This area is for the CO to document how often the contractor is allowed to submit invoices. An example is" Invoices shall be submitted on a monthly basis in accordance with the schedule."&emsp;<br />(End of clause)<br />H.5200.204.001 MAJOR BREACH OF SAFETY OR SECURITY (JUL 2015)</p>
<p>(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. Safety is essential to TSA and compliance with safety standards and practices is a material part of this contract. A major breach of safety may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this agreement, including termination for default. A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on the agreement. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality, serious injury, or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any "willful" or "repeat" violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan.</p>
<p>(b) Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage, sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of security may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this agreement, including termination for default. A major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be related directly to the work on the agreement. A major breach of security is an act or omission by the Contractor that results in compromise of classified information or sensitive security information or sensitive but unclassified information, including contractor proprietary information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000.</p>
<p>NOTE: Breach of Security for the purposes of this definition should not be confused with breach of security in screening operations.<br /><br />(c) In the event of a major breach of safety or security, the Contractor shall report the breach to the Contracting Officer. If directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall conduct its own investigation and report the results to the Government. The Contractor shall cooperate with the Government investigation, if conducted.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />H.5200.204.004 REQUIREMENTS AND DUTIES FOR HANDLING SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION (SSI) (JUL 2015)</p>
<p>Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &sect; 114(r), Sensitive Security Information and Nondisclosure of Security Activities, Sensitive Security Information (SSI) is a category of sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information that must be protected because it is information that, if publicly released, would be detrimental to the security of transportation. Under 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1520.5(a), the SSI Regulation also provides additional reasons for protecting information as SSI beyond the condition that the release of the information would be detrimental to the security of transportation. TSA, however, primarily uses the criterion of "detrimental to the security of transportation" when determining whether information is SSI.</p>
<p>Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520 defines the scope, categorization, handling requirements and disposition of information deemed SSI is the 49 C.F.R. Part 1520 (http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/). Persons authorized to access specific SSI (i.e., covered persons) include those contracted to DHS or TSA with a need-to-know basis for specific information in the course of fulfilling their TSA contractual obligations. TSA may deliver SSI materials to the Contractor. Also, materials created by the Contractor may require SSI designation and protection, and the Contractor has the responsibility to identify such materials to TSA as possible SSI. For guidance while working on TSA and DHS matters, see the TSA SSI Application Guide, 2011_04_01 for identifying the type of information covered by the regulation.<br />For purposes of this clause, the term "Contractor" shall include an individual or other legal entity who performs work for or on behalf of TSA or DHS under a contract, interagency agreement, or other transaction agreement. Such contracts include, but are not limited to, contracts between any non-Federal entity and/or TSA or DHS and subcontracts, joint venture agreements, and teaming agreements between any non-Federal entity and another non-Federal entity to perform work related to the primary contract with the TSA or DHS.</p>
<p>While SSI is not classified national security information subject to the handling requirements governing classified information, it is subject to certain legal disclosure limitations. To ensure regulatory compliance, the Contractor shall be subject to the following requirements and include this entire clause as flow-down in subcontracts, etc.:</p>
<p><br />(a) Handling and Safeguarding. The TSA Contractor shall safeguard and handle any SSI in accordance with the policies and procedures outlined in 49 C.F.R. Part 1520, as well as the DHS and TSA policies and procedures for handling and safeguarding SSI. These safeguarding procedures shall include SSI recognition, identification and marking of materials that possibly contain SSI, including Contractor-created materials, as well as following restrictions on disclosure, storage, handling, sharing, dissemination and destruction of SSI. The Contractor, without exception, shall place this requirement in all subcontracts, joint venture agreements, and teaming agreements related to the performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). The Contracting Officer will provide the non-disclosure form (DHS Form 11000-6), as necessary, to the Contractor when circumstances warrant. NDAs are required to be signed by all Contractor personnel when access to SSI is necessary for performance of the contract. By signing the NDA, the recipient certifies in writing that they will take the necessary steps to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and use of information.</p>
<p>(c) Request for Access to SSI materials. Pursuant to 49 C.F.R. Part 1520.9(a)(3), the Contractor must contact SSI@tsa.dhs.gov for guidance on handling requests to access to SSI (before using SSI materials) for any other purpose besides activities falling within the scope of the contract by other persons, including requests from experts, consultants, and legal counsel ("requesters") hired by the Contractor. The Contractor shall include the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer Representative (COR) as a carbon copy "cc" recipient of its contact to SSI@tsa.dhs.gov . The TSA SSI Office must first make a determination as to whether the requesters are a "covered person" with a "need to know" under 49 C.F.R. Parts 1520.7 and 1520.11.</p>
<p>(d) Training and Certification. All Contractor personnel who are covered persons with a need-to- know basis must complete the TSA-mandated SSI Awareness Training course prior to accessing SSI, and on an annual basis for the duration of the contract or for the duration of the requester's need for access to SSI, whichever is later. Contractor personnel must also review and adhere to the SSI Quick Reference Guide for DHS Employees and Contractors.

<p>H.5200.209.004 SUITABILITY DETERMINATION FOR CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES (JUL 2015)</p>
<p>All contractor employees seeking to provide services to TSA under a TSA contract are subject to a suitability determination to assess whether their initial employment or continued employment on a TSA contract protects or promotes the efficiency of the agency. TSA, by and through the Office of Security, Personnel Security Division (PerSec), will allow a contractor employee to commence work on a TSA contract only if a review of the contractor employee's preliminary background check is favorable. Contractor employees with unfavorable preliminary background checks will not be allowed to work on a TSA contract.</p>
<p>A suitability determination involves the following three phases:</p>
<p>Phase 1: Enter On Duty Suitability Determination: a review of a contractor employee's consumer credit report, criminal history records, and submitted security forms to determine, to the extent possible, if the contractor employee has bad debt and/or criminal offenses and/or falsification issues that would prohibit employment as a TSA contractor. This determination will include verification of citizenship for contractor employees born outside of the United States. A favorable Enter On Duty Suitability Determination is not a final suitability determination; rather, it is a preliminary review of external data sources that allows the contractor employee to commence work prior to the required background investigation being completed.</p>
<p>When a contractor employee is deemed suitable to commence work on a TSA contract, TSA PerSec will notify the appropriate Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) of the favorable determination. Similar notifications will be sent when a contractor employee has not passed the preliminary background check and has been deemed unsuitable.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Background Investigation: Once the contractor employee commences work on a TSA contract, TSA PerSec will process all submitted security forms to determine whether the contractor has previously been the subject of a federal background investigation sufficient in scope to meet TSA minimum investigative requirements. Contractor employees who have a federal investigation sufficient in scope will immediately be processed for final suitability adjudication. Those contractor employees who do not have a previous federal background investigation sufficient in scope will be scheduled for the appropriate level background investigation through the submission of their security forms to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).</p>
<p>Phase 3: Final Suitability Adjudication: TSA PerSec will complete the final suitability determination after receipt, review, and adjudication of the completed OPM background investigation. The final suitability determination is an assessment made by TSA PerSec to determine whether there is reasonable expectation that the continued employment of the TSA contractor will or will not protect or promote the efficiency of the agency. An unfavorable final suitability determination will result in a notification to the COR that the contractor employee has been deemed unsuitable for continued contract employment and that he/she shall be removed from the TSA contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p><br />H.5200.224.003 SECURITY OF SYSTEMS HANDLING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND PRIVACY INCIDENT REPONSE (JUL 2015)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions.</p>
<p>"Breach" (may be used interchangeably with "Privacy Incident') as used in this clause means the loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or any similar situation where persons other than authorized users, and for other than authorized purpose, have access or potential access to Personally Identifiable Information, in usable form whether physical or electronic.</p>
<p>"Personally Identifiable Information (PII)" as used in this clause means any information that permits the identity of an individual to be directly or indirectly inferred, including any other information that is linked or linkable to that individual regardless of whether the individual is a citizen of the United States, legal permanent resident, or a visitor to the United States.</p>
<p>Examples of PII include: name, date of birth, mailing address, telephone number, Social Security Number (SSN), email address, zip code, account numbers, certificate/license numbers, vehicle identifiers including license plates, uniform resource locators (URLs), Internet protocol addresses, biometric identifiers (e.g., fingerprints), photographic facial images, or any other unique identifying number or characteristic, and any information where it is reasonably foreseeable that the information will be linked with other information to identify the individual.</p>
<p>"Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (Sensitive PII)" as used in this clause is a subset of Personally Identifiable Information, which if lost, compromised or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. , Complete social security numbers (SSN), alien registration numbers (A-number) and biometric identifiers (such as fingerprint, voiceprint, or iris scan) are considered Sensitive PII even if they are not coupled with additional PII. Additional examples include any groupings of information that contains an individual's name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements:</p>
<p>(1) Driver's license number, passport number, or truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits)<br />(2) Date of birth (month, day, and year)<br />(3) Citizenship or immigration status<br />(4) Financial information such as account numbers or Electronic Funds Transfer Information<br />(5) Medical Information<br />(6) System authentication information such as mother's maiden name, account passwords or personal identification numbers (PIN)</p>
<p>Other Personally Identifiable information may be "sensitive" depending on its context, such as a list of employees with less than satisfactory performance ratings or an unlisted home address or phone number. In contrast, a business card or public telephone directory of agency employees contains Personally Identifiable Information but it is not sensitive.</p>
<p>Sensitive PII have higher impact ratings for purposes of privacy incident handling.</p>
<p>(b) Systems Access. Work to be performed under this contract requires the handling of Sensitive PII. The contractor shall provide the Government access to, and information regarding its systems, when requested by the Government, as part of its responsibility to ensure compliance with security requirements, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Government in assuring compliance with such requirements. Government access shall include independent validation testing of controls, system penetration testing by the Government, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) data reviews, and access by agency Inspectors General for its reviews.</p>
<p>(c) Systems Security. In performing its duties related to management, operation, and/or access of systems containing Sensitive PII under this contract, the contractor, its employees and subcontractors shall comply with applicable security requirements described in DHS Sensitive System Publication 4300A or any replacement publication and rules of conduct as described in TSA MD 3700.4&not;</p>

<p>The contractor shall only use Sensitive PII obtained under this contract for purposes of the contract, and shall not collect or use such information for any other purpose without the prior written approval of the contracting officer. At expiration or termination of this contract, the contractor shall turn over all Sensitive PII obtained under the contract that is in its possession to the Government.</p>
<p>(e) Breach Response. The contractor agrees that in the event of any actual or suspected breach of PII (i.e., loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, access for an unauthorized purpose, or other unauthorized access, whether physical or electronic), it shall immediately, and in no event later than one hour of discovery, report the breach to the contracting officer, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), and the TSA Director of Privacy Policy &amp; Compliance (TSAprivacy@dhs.gov).

The Contractor shall immediately report to the Government all actual or suspected violations of Government information, personnel, or physical security requirements. The Contractor shall fully comply with all of the reporting requirements that are expressed for specified circumstances and issues identified in discrete Federal Acquisition Regulation or Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation clauses in force under this contract. <br />b) Emergency Situations While on Government Premises. Contractor employees shall immediately report any emergency situations they may witness (any circumstance where actual or potential loss of life, serious injury, or critical damage to property, or other serious incidents, such as fires, or workplace violence, terrorist activities, or other criminal behavior is occurring ) per standing TSA procedures while they are performing under contract in government facilities.<br />c) Government Employee Misconduct. In the event of misconduct by a government employee which is observed or witnessed by a contractor employee, (or in the event of any unauthorized conduct to which a Government employee may subject a contractor employee) the contractor employee shall immediately report such to their on-site contractor supervisor or other company-designated management official, the Contracting Officer and/or Contracting Officer's Representative.<br />d) Workplace safety. In the event of any situation involving workplace safety, the contractor employee shall immediately report such to their on-site contractor supervisor or other company -designated management official, the Contracting Officer and/or Contracting Officer's Representative.</p>
<p>4. The Contracting Officer may require dismissal from work under this contract and/or removal of access to government facilities, property, information and/or information systems of those employees which the Contracting Officer deems contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national security.</p>
<p>5. Non-Disclosure Agreements are required to be signed by all Contractor personnel when their role requires them to come into contact with Sensitive But Unclassified, Government procurement sensitive information, and/or other sensitive information, or proprietary business information from other Contractors (e.g., cost data, plans, and strategies). The recipient certifies in writing that they will take the necessary steps to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and use of information. The Contracting Officer will provide the prescribed non-disclosure forms as necessary to the Contractor when circumstances warrant.</p>
<p>B. BASIC REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE<br />1. Contractor Responsibility for Performance Management. The Contractor shall provide all management, administrative, clerical, and supervisory functions required for the effective and efficient performance of this contract.<br />2. Limitation on Government Liability. The Government shall not be liable for any injury to the Contractor's personnel or damage to the Contractor's property unless such injury or damage is due to negligence on the part of the Government and is recoverable under the Federal Torts Claims Act, or pursuant to another Federal statutory authority.<br />3. Responsibility for Effective Contract Transitions. A smooth and orderly transition between the Contractor and a predecessor or successor Contractor is necessary to ensure minimum disruption to vital Government business. The Contractor shall cooperate fully in the transition.<br />4. The Government observes the following holidays:</p>

The Contractor agrees to continue to provide sufficient personnel to perform critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be guided by the instructions issued by the Contracting Officer or the Contracting Officer's Representative. Observance of such holidays by Government personnel shall not be a reason for the Contractor to request an extension of the period of performance, or entitlement of compensation except as set forth within the contract.</p>
<p>c) In the event the Contractor's personnel work during the holiday or other excused absences, they may be compensated by the Contractor, however, no form of holiday or other premium compensation will be considered either as a direct or indirect cost, other than their normal compensation for the time worked. For cost reimbursable and time and material (T&amp;M) contracts, the Government will only consider as direct and/or indirect costs those efforts actually performed during the holiday or excused absences in the event contractor personnel are not dismissed. This provision does not preclude reimbursement for authorized overtime work if applicable to this contract. <br />Otherwise, the management responsibility for contractor functions approved by the Contracting Officer for offsite work, in the event of inaccessibility of federal workplaces are the sole responsibility of the contractor. The contractor may propose telework or other solutions when critical work is required, however, the Contractor is solely responsible for any cost differential in performance, all liabilities that may be due to performance at an alternate location and all resources necessary to complete such performance.</p>

Unless the Contractor is provided a formal notification to the contrary, usually via a Stop Work Order pursuant to FAR 52.242-15, the Contractor must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of the contract. If a contract will not be affected by a shutdown, generally no separate notification or communication of that fact will be provided.</p>
<p>C. CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSIGNED SPACE, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES. If, due to the fault or neglect of the Contractor, his agents, or employees, damages are caused to any Government property, equipment, stock or supplies, during the performance of this contract, the Contractor shall be responsible for such loss or damage and the Government, at its option, may either require the Contractor to replace all property or to reimburse the Government for the full value of the lost or damaged property.

All proposed substitutes shall have qualifications equal to or higher than the qualifications of the person to be replaced. The CO shall be notified in writing of any proposed substitution at least fifteen (15) days, or forty-five (45) days if either a background investigation for building or information system access and/or a security clearance (due to classified contract requirements that relate specifically to personnel) must be obtained to meet the contract's requirements, in advance of the proposed substitution. Such notification from the contractor shall include:<br />1. an explanation of the circumstances necessitating the substitution;<br />2. a complete resume of the proposed substitute; and<br />3. any other information requested by the CO to enable him/her to judge whether or not the Contractor is maintaining the same high quality of personnel that provided the partial basis for award.<br />The CO and COR will evaluate substitution requests and promptly notify the Contractor of his/her approval or disapproval in writing. All disapprovals will require resubmission of another substitution within 15 calendar days by the Contractor.</p>
<p>I. FAILURE TO COMPLY. Any failure by the Contractor to comply with these requirements may result in a contract termination and/or any other remedy available to the Government, up to and including criminal prosecution where provided for by law.</p>
<p>J. INTERRELATIONSHIP OF ASSOCIATE CONTRACTORS. The TSA may enter into contractual agreements with other Contractors (i.e., "Associate Contractors") in order to fulfill requirements separate from the work to be performed under this contract, yet having a relationship to performance under this contract. It is expected that contractors working under TSA contracts will have to work together under certain conditions in order to achieve a common solution for TSA. The Contractor may be required to coordinate with other such Contractor(s) through the cognizant Contracting Officer (CO) and/or designated representative in providing suitable, non-conflicting technical and/or management interface and in avoidance of duplication of effort. Information on deliverables provided under separate contracts may, at the discretion of the TSA and/or other Government agencies, be provided to such other Contractor(s) for the purpose of such work.</p>
<p>Where the Contractor and an associate Contractor fail to agree upon action to be taken in connection with their respective responsibilities, each Contractor shall promptly bring the matters to the attention of the cognizant CO and furnish the Contractor's recommendations for a solution. The Contractor shall not be relieved of its obligations to make timely deliveries or be entitled to any other adjustment because of failure of the Contractor and its associate to promptly refer matters to the CO or because of failure to implement CO directions.</p>
<p>Where the Contractor and Associate Contractors are required to collaborate to deliver a service; the Government will designate, in writing and prior to the definition of the task, to both Contractors, a "lead Contractor" for the project. In these cases the Associate Contractors shall also be contractually required to coordinate and collaborate with the Contractor. TSA will facilitate the mutual execution of Non-Disclosure Agreements.</p>
<p>K. PERSONAL SERVICES<br />"Personal services" are those in which contractor personnel would appear to be, in effect, Government employees via the direct supervision and oversight by Government employees. No personal services shall be performed under this contract. No Contractor employee will be directly supervised by a Government employee. All individual Contractor employee assignments, and daily work direction, shall be given by the applicable employee supervisor of the Contractor. If the Contractor believes any Government action or communication has been given that would create a personal services relationship between the Government and any Contractor employee, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of this communication or action.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not perform any inherently Governmental actions as defined by FAR 7.500. No Contractor employee shall hold him or herself out to be a Government employee, agent, or representative. No Contractor employee shall state orally or in writing at any time that he or she is acting on behalf of the Government. In all communications in connection with this contract, Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractor employees and specify the name of the company for which they work. In all communications with other Government Contractors in connection with this contract, the Contractor employee shall state that they have no authority to in any way change any contract and that if the other Contractor believes this communication to be a direction to change their contract, they should notify the Contracting Officer for that contract and not carry out the direction until a clarification has been issued by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that all of its employees working on this contract are informed of the substance of this clause. Nothing in this special contract requirement shall limit the Government's rights in any way under any other term of the contract, including those related to the Government's right to inspect and accept the services to be performed under this contract. The substance of this special contract requirement shall be included in all subcontracts at any tier.</p>
<p>Compliance with this Special Contract Requirement is included in the contract price and shall not be a basis for equitable adjustment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

However, award may also be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quote, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.</p>
<p>It is at the Government's discretion and its intention to select one contractor for award of this Contract. The above evaluation factors will be used to determine the best value for the Government with the intention of award without communications.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District, intends to acquire one new standard commercial configuration steel tracked Heavy-Duty Hydraulic Excavator to support the dredging mission of the Corps of Engineers Dredge, William L. Goetz. This Excavator will be regularly transported by a barge in conjunction with the Dredge Goetz fleet. Due to the rated deck load capacity of the transport barge, the maximum weight of the excavator (fully loaded (sans operator) and fueled) must be no more than 70,000 lbs. The principal purposes of the excavator include placing and installing drop structures, constructing earthen containment berms, and undertaking mechanical dredging of the Mississippi River and its tributaries from the deck of the transport barge. That work will entail the excavation, lifting, and placement of wet sand at full arm/boom extension.<br /><br />The Government intends to issue a purchase order to the quoter providing the lowest-priced product that meets ALL of the following salient characteristics. Compliance with the salient characteristics of the solicitation will be determined by evaluating the standard commercial configuration product quoted against the requirements of the solicitation using product brochures, catalogs and other publicly available information. Quotations offering nonstandard products or nonstandard product configurations will not be considered. Multiple quotations from the same vendor will not be considered.<br />

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to OPAP@uscg.mil or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />&emsp;</p>
<p><br />&emsp;<br />The contractor bid price(s) shall be all inclusive to provide for all labor, material , supplies, transportation, supervision and all other necessary items for a complete and usable project, performing all work in a workman like manner in complete compliance with all plans, drawings, and specifications which are contained in this solicitation..</p>

<p>IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE CLAUSE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE, THE FOLLOWING CLAUSES ARE APPLICABLE TO THE RFQ AND RESULTING CONTRACT:</p>
<p><br />52.225-9 BUY AMERICAN ACT-CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS (SEPT 2010)<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause- <br />"Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item"- <br />(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is- <br />(i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at FAR 2.101); <br />(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and <br />(iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and <br />(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in section 3 of the Shipping Act of 1984 ( 46 U.S.C. App. 1702), such as agricultural products and petroleum products. <br />"Component" means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into a construction material. <br />"Construction material" means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material. <br />"Cost of components" means- <br />(3) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the construction material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or <br />(4) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the construction material. <br />"Domestic construction material" means- <br />(1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States; <br />(2) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if- <br />(i) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which non-availability determinations have been made are treated as domestic; or <br />(ii) The construction material is a COTS item. <br />"Foreign construction material" means a construction material other than a domestic construction material. <br />"United States" means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas. <br />(b) Domestic preference. <br />(1) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a - 10d) by providing a preference for domestic construction material. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, the component test of the Buy American Act is waived for construction material that is a COTS item (See FAR 12.505(a)(2)). The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause. <br />(2) This requirement does not apply to information technology that is a commercial item or to the construction materials or components listed by the Government as follows: <br />_____None___________________________________________ <br />(3) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause if the Government determines that- <br />(i) The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. The cost of a particular domestic construction material subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent; <br />(ii) The application of the restriction of the Buy American Act to a particular construction material would be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or <br />(iii) The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. <br />(c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American Act. <br />(1)(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including- <br />(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials; <br />(B) Unit of measure; <br />(C) Quantity; <br />(D) Price; <br />(E) Time of delivery or availability; <br />(F) Location of the construction project; <br />(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and <br />(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause. <br />(ii) A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause. <br />(iii) The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued). <br />(iv) Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination. <br />(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American Act applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American Act applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with the Buy American Act. <br />(d) Data. To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the following information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers:<br />Foreign and Domestic Construction Materials Price Comparison <br />Construction Material Description Unit of Measure Quantity Price (Dollars)* <br />Item 1: <br />Foreign construction material _______ _______ _______ <br />Domestic construction material _______ _______ _______ <br /><br />Item 2: _______ _______ _______ <br />Foreign construction material _______ _______ _______ <br />Domestic construction material <br />[List name, address, telephone number, and contact for suppliers surveyed. Attach copy of response; if oral, attach summary.] <br />[Include other applicable supporting information.] <br />[* Include all delivery costs to the construction site and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued).]</p>
<p>52.232-99 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENT TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEVIATION) (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16,<br />Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012.<br />(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor.<br />(b) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.<br />(c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the services offered to meet the Government requirement; and,<br />(ii) Price.</p>
<p>The importance of technical capability is approximately equal to price, when compared to price. Proposals will be evaluated in order of lowest-priced proposal to highest-priced proposal. Award will be made to the lowest-priced, technically acceptable proposal.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC>This solicitation, SP4708-15-R-0001, was previously synopsized on January 15, 2015 under the FBO Presolicitation Notice "SP4708-15-R-0001(Update)".&nbsp; The solicitation&nbsp;can be accessed by selecting&nbsp;and downloading the attachments to this notice.&nbsp; Prospective offerors are advised to download and review all attached materials prior to responding to this solicitation.<br /><br /><strong>* Amendment 0008 has been issued to provide updated versions of "Attachment 6 - Historic Sales Data" and "Attachment 7 - Commercial Sales Pricing Practices", which previously contained electronic file errors.<br />* Amendment 0007 has been issued to replaced the Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) clause.&nbsp; The most recent versions of Attachments 1, 2, and 4 have been&nbsp;included&nbsp;in the attachment package for convenience. <br />* Amendment 0006 has been&nbsp;issued as "Refresh No. 2",&nbsp;revising various portions of the solicitation, and extended the closing date for the period ending October 30, 2015 to November 20, 2015.&nbsp;Please be sure to download, complete, and submit&nbsp;all attachments. as applicable.</strong><br />* Amendment 0005 has been issued to add additional PSCs to Table A.6.2.1. <br />* Amendment 0004 has been issued to: update the table of "Quarterly Last Month Open Periods", extending the period opening on 06 July 2015 to 14 August 2015; add additional PSCs to Table A.6.2.1; provide updated "Questions and Answers" (see Attachments); add requirement for vendor verification regarding excluded items (see Attachments); and other revisions providing clarifications regarding excluded items.<br />* Amendment 0003 has been issued as "Refresh No. 1", revising various portions of the solicitation, resulting in editorial changes and updated terms and conditions.<br />* Amendment 0002 has been issued updating the table of "Quarterly Last Month Open Periods".&nbsp; <br />* Amendment 0001 has been issued in order to provide guidance on formatting requirements.<br /><br /><br /><br />DOD EMALL is an internet-based ordering service that allows customers to make a "Best Value" decision for products from a variety of sources through a single entry point based on price, delivery, product description, vendor performance, or other factors required to meet mission objectives.<br /><br />This DOD EMALL solicitation seeks to establish Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) type contracts for various commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items which will be ordered through the DOD EMALL system for delivery to DOD EMALL customers worldwide. DOD EMALL customers include DoD military and non-military customers, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) acting as or on behalf of the customer, and customers of other Government entities (including Federal, State, and/or Local). This solicitation is being issued as part of a Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program using the guidance of FAR and DFARS Subpart 8.4 for ordering procedures. (See DLAD 8.400-90 DoD electronic mall (EMALL) and FAR 38.000 Federal Supply Schedule Contracting). The DoD MAS program is designed to provide logistic support that empowers the customer to select the product that best meets their mission needs using best value ordering procedures. <br /><br />This solicitation shall remain open for period not to exceed five (5) years in total length, unless sooner replaced by an updated solicitation, with recurring opening and closing periods on a quarterly basis. <br /><br />The intention of this solicitation is to make multiple awards for the entire spectrum of categories of items required. The maximum quantity of supplies for this acquisition is set at $100 Million (M) based on the aggregated total value of all of the individual IDIQ maximums to be established for each individual contract awarded as a result of this solicitation. The guaranteed minimum dollar value that the Government agrees to order during the period of any awarded contract will be $100.00. No order against any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation shall exceed $100,000.<br /><br />This solicitation will also act as an interim solution for prospective suppliers to submit catalogs for loading to the DOD EMALL system until this system is replaced by the Next Generation e-Commerce Solution (NGe-Com), which may become a "Federal Mall", or "FedMall" (note: this effort was previously referred to as "DOD EMALL 2.0"). It is anticipated that "FedMall" will be in its Full Deployment (FD) phase of development as early as the end of the third quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Given this aggressive timeline and the overall complexity of this effort, it is anticipated that there will be an integrated concurrent approach to development and deployment.<br /><br />The scope of this solicitation is limited to a subset of the DLA Managed Federal Supply Classes (FSCs; also referred to as Product Service Codes (PSCs)) and commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items (see FAR 2.101) matching the FSC descriptions. Descriptions of the required items (and excluded items), technical requirements, and performance requirements are outlined in the solicitation's Schedule of Supplies/Services and Statement of Work.<br /><br />All ordering shall be conducted electronically. DOD EMALL is the sole means by which orders will be issued against any contract awarded in response to this solicitation. Prospective suppliers will be required to submit an Electronic Commerce ("EC") Implementation Plan with their proposals. The EC Implementation Plan shall detail the contractor's computer hardware/software, thereby outlining the contractor's capability to receive electronic orders. At a minimum, all responding offerors must address how they intend on interfacing with the DOD EMALL System and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service's (DFAS's) Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system. <br /><br />Suppliers will also create a catalog using the Microsoft Excel workbook titled "DOD EMALL Catalog Loader Template and Instructions.xlsx" (see Attachment 2). The first spreadsheet (tab) in this workbook, entitled "Data Dictionary", provides descriptions and instructions for each of the catalog loader data elements, and identifies the ten (10) mandatory data elements that must be addressed for each item when creating a new catalog or issuing a catalog change. The second spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Requirements", provides the template that suppliers shall populate when submitting their catalog. The third spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Unit of Issue Codes", provides a listing of all acceptable Unit of Issue (UOI) codes used within the DOD EMALL system, which offerors are required to identify for each item in their catalog. The vendor shall also establish "Days After Receipt of Order (ARO)" for each item in its catalog. Vendors shall honor the posted delivery times in the catalog at the time of delivery order placement. Vendors will be required to make every effort to ship urgent or high priority orders within 24 hours after receipt of order, at no additional cost to the government, and meet all Preservation, Packaging, Packing, Labeling and Marking (PPPL&amp;M) requirements. All offered pricing within Supplier Catalogs shall be Fright on Board (FOB) Destination and must be inclusive of all shipping, handling, and transportation costs.

<p>Solicitation Number: FA8617-15-R-6199 15 July 2015</p>
<p>The purpose of this SSS Amendment is to provide Industry a REVISED PWS due to significant changes of requirements. The original SSS posted on 26 May 2015 remains applicable.</p>
<p>1. This SSS amendment and the attached revised Performance Work Statement (PWS) describe an acquisition strategy for an anticipated CLS/Maintenance Training program for the Afghan Trainer Program in Afghanistan. Vendors are encouraged to carefully review the entire PWS as there are multiple changes made throughout the PWS. The changes are too numerous to specify individually. Industry is encouraged to carefully review the revised PWS in its entirety.</p>
<p>2. PoP revised as follows:</p>
<p>This CLS/Maintenance Training contract will consist of the following Period of Performance (PoP) of one (1) 12 month base with four (4) x one (1)/year Options:</p>
<p>&bull;&middot; Base: 01 Jul 2016 -30 Jun 2017</p>
<p>&bull;&middot; Option 1: 01 Jul 2017 -30 Jun 2018</p>
<p>&bull;&middot; Option 2: 01 Jul 2018 -30 Jun 2019</p>

<p>&bull;&middot; Option 4: 01 Jul 2020 -30 Jun 2021</p>
<p>3. Capability Survey Questions - Industry should respond to the additional questions listed below. Industry need not respond to the original questions in the original SSS posted on 26 May 2015.</p>
<p>1. There will be contract CLINs for transferring 2, 4, and/or 6 aircraft per year to AAF responsibility. Describe your approach for supporting the drawdown of USG aircraft support if any of these CLINs are exercised. See PWS paragraph 1.2.1.</p>
<p>2. Describe your approach to measure On-The-Job (OJT) training to prepare AAF students for the next level of instruction.</p>
<p>3. Describe your concept to flexibility for supporting 40 hours/aircraft/month during fighting season, 20 hours/aircraft/month during non-fighting season with 25% surge capability along with supporting AAF responsible aircraft maintenance, supplemental training and contingency operations. See PWS paragraph 1.2.2.</p>
<p>4. Describe your approach to performing maintenance of AAF responsible aircraft IAW PWS paragraph 3.2.4.</p>
<p>5. Remobilization. Since Afghanistan is an unstable environment there is the possibility that the contractor would have to relocate to another base during the contract period. The contractor can assume that the same level of government furnished services/supplies will be at the new location. Please provide your concerns, if any, to the following scenarios for relocating from Kandahar to another coalition base in a region.</p>
<p>Scenario #1: All nine (9) C208B aircraft located at Kandahar will move to the new base, along with tools, support equipment, and contractor personnel.</p>
<p>Scenario #2: All nine (9) C208B aircraft located at Kandahar will remain and transition to "AAF responsible" aircraft. The contractor will provide tools and support equipment for purchase by the USG to provide to the AAF for support of the 9 aircraft. The contractor will adjust the number of FAA Airframe &amp; Power plant certified mechanics appropriately to service the smaller fleet size of USG responsible aircraft while retaining the capability to support any requests for the increased size of the AAF responsible fleet. The contractor personnel will move to the new base.</p>
<p>6. Training: Describe your experience with performing aircraft maintenance training of Middle Eastern country personnel in their host country?</p>
<p>4. Additional Information</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought  <br>  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY and an ANNOUNCMENT FOR AN INDUSTRY DAY  <br>  Request for Information (RFI)  <br>  Sources Sought, Corporate Capability Statements, Draft Performance Work Statements (PWS) and Industry Day Announcement  <br>  RFI Overview:  The Army Contracting Command-Redstone (ACC-Redstone) is seeking information concerning the interest and availability of capable contractors to provide contract support to the Aviation and Missile Command's (AMCOM) aviation maintenance programs.  This is the initial market research for the upcoming follow-on programs.  As a result, no firm plan or strategy is in place at this time.  The potential requirements covered by this RFI will include the following:  <br>  a.  AMCOM Aviation Field Maintenance (AFM) Contract:  This contract will provide for field and sustainment maintenance for rotary wing Army aviation platforms in support of the mission area managed or supported by AMCOM.  It is anticipated the contract will require the contractor to accomplish the following: maintenance of Army Aviation aircraft to potentially include RESET, or similar programs, in accordance with established Technical Bulletins and Directives, the installation of Modification Work Orders (MWOs), support to installation aviation activities, and support to Combat Aviation Brigades (CAB).  Reference Attachment 0001 DRAFT AFM CONUS and Attachment 0002 AFM OCONUS PWSs that provide potential scope to be performed.  <br>  b.  Ft. Rucker Aviation Maintenance Services Contract:  Contracted services will maintain and provide safe, functional helicopters to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command's (TRADOC) flight school training program through the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) as well as to support the Air Force's 23rd Flight Training Squadron (FTS), the US Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL), the National Maintenance Program, and other minor requirements.  Reference Attachment 0003 Army ACLC Draft PWS, Attachment 0004 Air Force DRAFT PWS for potential scope, and Attachment 0005 Draft Incentive Fee Criteria.     <br>  Contract Background and Anticipated Period of Performance:  It is anticipated that the AFM contract will take the form of either an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract or a base year contract with options.  It is anticipated that the Ft. Rucker contract will consist of a base year and options.  Successful offerors for both programs, AFM and Ft. Rucker, will be determined on a best value approach.  It is anticipated that all contracts will include the minimum of a seven year period of performance.  It is anticipated that both the AFM and Ft. Rucker efforts will include a hybrid contract type and potentially incentives.  The hybrid contracts could include both fixed and cost type arrangements.  The location of the effort to be performed by the AFM requirement will be both in the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).  It is contemplated that a regional approach will be utilized for the AFM effort.  Each region will include maintenance sites that could easily change as the operational requirements evolve.  The Ft. Rucker requirements will primarily take place at Ft. Rucker, Al.  Both the AFM and Ft. Rucker requirements are considered services with the appropriate services laws and regulations being applicable.  All contracts awarded will include the Ground and Flight Risk clause and will require a higher level of quality requirements to potentially include Aerospace Standard 9110 (current version).  It is anticipated that North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 488190, Other Support Activities for Air Transportation, will apply.  The current standard is $32.5M.    <br>  Sources Sought:  The ACC-Redstone would like to identify businesses that have experience in all or a part of the requirements described above and in the attached PWSs.  Please provide a statement as to your company's name and if you have tentative plans to propose on one or both of the programs as a prime, or if you are looking for subcontractor opportunities only.  In addition, ideas as to contract types, the structure of the contract, how to incentivize exceptional quality and/or performance are requested.  Ideas on how to streamline the proposal generation process is also being solicited.  Note that any actual requirement(s) will eventually be announced through FedBizOpps.    <br>  Corporate Capability Statements:  It is requested that interested parties provide a Corporate Capability Statement that reflects their potential to fulfill the Government's requirements.  A desire of the Government is that the Corporate Capability Statement cover letter also include details related to the size of the company based on the anticipated NAICS code of 488190.  Specifically the letter should address if the business is a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, Woman-Owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned, Serviced Disabled Veteran, etc.    <br>  Performance Work Statements (PWS):  Interested contractors are requested to review the accompanying DRAFT PWS for the AFM and Ft. Rucker efforts and respond to the contracting officer point of contact (POC) with any comments, innovative ideas, performance or quality incentives and measurements, best industry practices, or acquisition streamlining that might enhance the PWS or the aviation maintenance services programs.  Please note that these are overarching DRAFT PWSs that describe the mission areas and a description of the type of work.  They will change as requirements are better identified and acquisition strategies are developed.     <br>  Industry Day:  An industry day related to these acquisitions is to take place in Huntsville, Al. at the Jackson Center, located at 600 Genome Way, Huntsville, Al 35806, on Thursday, March 12, 2015.  Due to limited seating, it is requested that attendance be limited to two individuals from any one company.  Separate briefings will be held for each of the proposed actions described above.  The AFM brief will take place at 8:30 A.M., CST.  The Ft. Rucker brief will immediately follow.     <br>    <br>  This RFI pertains to sources sought, corporate capability statements to include any suggestions related to contract incentive, requirement generation or proposal submission streamlining, DRAFT PWSs information, and an Industry Day announcement.  This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government.  Any formal solicitation(s) will be announced separately.  It is anticipated that a draft solicitation for industry's comments may be released in the fourth quarter of Calendar Year (CY) 2015 for the AFM effort and the first quarter of CY 2016 for the Ft. Rucker effort.  However, these dates are estimates and subject to change without notice.  The Government is anticipating awarding multiple contracts for the AFM effort and one contract for the Ft. Rucker effort.  Source Selection will be conducted per applicable guidance of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 15 and supplemental guidance.  Note that only comments are solicited under this RFI.  No questions will be entertained.  Send all comments relating to the DRAFT PWS or cost incentive ideas to the listed Contracting Officer POC.  Contacts to Government personnel by potential offerors regarding this RFI subject are restricted and must proceed through the Contracting Officer POC.

Each page of the submission shall contain the document identifier in the document header. Respondents should ensure to label any information contained in the white paper considered to be proprietary. <br />Data Requested<br />The United States Army is conducting market research to identify currently available technological solutions and approaches in support of the Air and Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS). AMDWS is the Force Operations (FO) component of the Air and Missile Defense Planning and Control System (AMDPCS) and the Air Defense Airspace Management (ADAM) Cell providing both planning and Situational Awareness of Air Defense assets.</p>
<p>This notice is published in accordance with FAR Parts 10.002 and 15.201 and is a Request for Information (RFI) only in support of market research. All information received will be used for planning purposes only. This notice does not constitute Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, or Request for Quotes. The Government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it.</p>
<p>PROBLEM STATEMENT: AMDWS is the Air Defense component for AMDPCS, ADAM Cell, and Army Mission Command (MC). AMDWS is also the gateway between the Air and Missile Defense (AMD) Force and the Maneuver Commander. Interoperability with MC, Joint and Multinational systems will be maintained and extended to enable collaborative planning and situational awareness through tactical graphics and staff element overlays. The U.S. Army will update AMDWS with regulatory changes required to maintain interoperability with the Air Operations Center (AOC) and the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC). The AMDWS system will retrieve, fuse, and distribute this time-sensitive information to support operator inputs necessary for decision cycle dominance at all AMD Echelons. The AMDWS user interface will enable display of the near real time situation to allow the primary FO mission of monitoring the situation, assessing the situation, conducting planning, and directing and controlling forces to be performed easily. The fusion of the current Battlespace picture on AMDWS is an enabler as the primary Common Operating Picture (COP) within the ADAM Cell, AMDPCS, and Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). The AMDWS operates at SECRET classification level and requires compliance with the DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Program (DIACAP).</p>
<p>The U.S. Army seeks to maintain the current AMDWS capability set as well as provide enhancements to meet emerging requirements. Any candidate solution must meet the following AMDWS capability set:</p>
<p>1) Disseminate integrated Air Picture sourced from Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD), Air Defense System Integrator (ADSI), Self-Reporters, and Blue Force Tracker (BFT) - A. This interface must be accomplished with no changes to the above systems.<br />2) Interface with various systems for Situational Awareness (SA) information exchange to include Mission Command (MC) Data Dissemination Service (DDS), Command Post of the Future (CPOF), Command Post Web. This interface must be accomplished with no changes to the above systems.<br />3) Facilitate airspace coordination among the Air Operations Center (AOC), Surface-to-Air Missile Operations Center (SAMOC), Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS), and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) using the Air Operations Community of Interest (AO COI) schema, United States Military Text Format (USMTF), and Allied Data Publication 3 (ADatP-3). This interface must be accomplished with no changes to the system/schema.<br />4) Conduct Defense Design planning with Command, Control, Battle Management &amp; Communications (C2BMC), Patriot, and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD).

<SUBJECT>R--Warehouse Inventory Control - Logistics Management
<SOLNBR>R16PS00039
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<ARCHDATE>12152016
<CONTACT>Gates, Misty
<DESC>
This amendment is being issued because there have been several questions asked about what Reclamation is seeking.  The original announcement states that Reclamation has an obsolete warehouse and inventory controls system; Reclamation is not looking to replace CARMA, its warehouse stock management system or Federal Business Management System (FBMS).  The intent is to enhance the existing systems through warehouse and inventory controls, resulting in property being adequately accounted for.  Thus, we are looking for industry ideas to fill the gaps. In addition, we are looking for tool cataloging, inventory, tool management (control), total visibility of tool assets on the project and possibly tool procurement solutions.


The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), Pacific Northwest Region, is seeking information regarding procurement strategies for the upcoming purchase of a Warehouse Inventory Control Management System (WICMS) for the facilities at Grand Coulee Dam.  The WICMS will be used to support the mission requirements of maintenance repair and logistical support at Grand Coulee.  This is not an Invitation for Bids (IFB), Request for Proposals (RFP), or Request for Quotations (RFQ).  Solicitation no. R16PS00039 was created as a means to issue this RFI  it will not carry forward to any future procurements.  Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any of the services/products described herein.  You will not be entitled to payment for any costs you incur in responding to this RFI.  The information obtained will be used by Reclamation in developing an acquisition strategy.

The intent of this RFI is to ascertain whether there is a logistics system currently on the market that can function as a comprehensive fully integrated WICMS solution.  The solution must provide organizational wide level integration and be inclusive of warehouse operations and inventory control management systems that support BORs critical mission to provide water supply and power generation.  The solution will need to be maintained on a local server; Cloud-based solutions will not work because they are a security risk.

In order to facilitate planning, drafting and publishing of a future RFP, respondents are being asked to provide their recommendations for optimal use of warehouse space, inventory control, and total asset visibility throughout the entire Grand Coulee project.  The process summaries included in the below background information provide a high-level overview of the key functions sought for implementation.  These are intended to assist respondents in presenting options for scoping the project and demonstrating the modules and features currently on the market that will be required for implementation.  Responses to this RFI need not be limited only to the information outlined.  Respondents should include recommendations for better business practices, Standard Operating Procedures, new technology and/or management tools that the respondent believes to be best suited as a solution.

Background.  BOR currently employs a staff of approximately 400 maintenance, engineering and technical employees who are responsible for buildings, utility, electrical and electronics, and power plant maintenance across the nations largest hydroelectric dam.  Staff maintenance and service responsibilities at the Grand Coulee Dam encompass approximately 15 square miles, and an estimated 440,000 square feet of building and facility space, and all facility access and support roads.  In addition, BOR utilizes several outside contractors to perform specialized work related to power generation and water supply.

In an average week, BORs warehouse group, which operates the warehouse service desk and call center, receives approximately 500 service calls from BOR staff and other users of the facilities.  In total these calls result in the creation of, on average, approximately 375 new work orders for reactive requests in the current system.  Beyond these work orders the respective maintenance shops also complete numerous preventive/scheduled maintenance activities that may or may not have an associated warehouse work order. 

Currently employees at Grand Coulee use CARMA and the Federal Business Management System (FBMS) as part of their inventory management for certain items. Items that are tracked in FBMS are those that are at a dollar threshold of $5,000.00 or, more or are deemed sensitive.  An Inventory Control Number (ICN) is associated to these items and they are then added to a Custodial Officers Account.  These items are inventoried annually with reports due back to the Regional Office for accountability sake.  CARMA is a maintenance management system that is used for tracking maintenance cost and scheduling.  It also has an inventory module however; it is not used to its full potential.  Some warehouse stocked items are loaded to this module when items have been received through the property office.  Warehousemen then show usage by removing those items from CARMA.  Tools and other equipment that fall below this dollar threshold are not tracked in either of these two systems but need to be tracked in some manner.

Based on information provided in response to this RFI, BOR presently plans to initiate a subsequent RFP solicitation process in which BOR will seek services to deploy a complete update of BORs obsolete warehouse and inventory control systems.  This update will not only unite the current non-integrated work order and materials management systems, but will also furnish additional, significantly more robust functionalities that will enable, facilitate, and support BORs larger Asset Management efforts.

Industry Day.  BOR intends to allow respondents to participate in an industry day to be held at Grand Coulee Power Office, Hwy 155 Grand Coulee, WA, 99133, on November 17, 2015 at         10:00 a.m PT.  The industry day will include an overview of BORs requirement, a tour of the site, and a question/answer session.  Respondents intending to attend the industry day must register by close of business on November 15, 2015.  Foreign Nationals shall submit a copy of their passport information no later than close of business on November 12, 2015.  Registration point of contact is Matt Tillman.  Mr. Tillman can be reached by telephone at (509) 633-9518 or by email at mtillman@usbr.gov. 

Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFPs/IFBs/RFQs, if issued. If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website (FBO - www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of any potential offer to monitor FBO for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  

The closing date for this RFI is December 15, 2015.  Responses and/or questions regarding this RFI shall be emailed to Misty Gates, Contract Specialist, at mgates@usbr.gov.

DESCRIPTION

The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, Title X Part III (Public Law 111-11) signed on March 30, 2009, provided the authorization to construct this important project as a major component of the Navajo Nation San Juan River Basin Water Rights Settlement in New Mexico. 

An RFI (R15PS01052) was announced on May 22, 2015 which requested the following information.

1.	Questions for Design-Build Teams:
a.	Does your company have the capacity to permit, design, and build the CLWTP considering the information provided in this RFI and assuming there are no significant deviations from this information once more data is provided?
b.	Company point of contact, address, telephone number, and status of the company; (i.e., small business, HUBZone business, etc.)
c.	Provide your companys portfolio as it relates to:
1.	Design-build in general.
2.	Specific application to water treatment facilities.
3.	Similar size/type of WTP needed for this project that you have designed and/or built.
4.	Highlight any innovative treatment (design or construction) techniques you have used to reduce cost and/or maintenance time.
d.	Describe your companys experience in designing water treatment plants for natural organic matter reduction, including but not limited to biofiltration and other treatment processes.
e.	Describe companys experience with water treatment operation under a design-build-operate scenario.
2.	Questions for Equipment Manufacturers, Representatives and Process Engineers:
a.	Suggested treatment processes with pertinent technical data sufficient to support manufacturers representations, operational requirements, costs (initial installation and operational), warranties and proprietary information.
b.	Market standard sizes, lay-outs, plans and specifications, space and power requirements, typical and maximum/minimum feed rates, typical replacement or service time requirements, and typical life cycle costs per 1,000 gallons for a water treatment plant of this size/capacity.
c.	Company information, such as socio economic status, size, market share, annual sales, length of time in business, length of time with this specific product.
d.	List of projects using this treatment process.

DESIGN DATA

A.  The CLWTP will serve the Eastern portion of the NGWSP and will consist of a water treatment plant (WTP) and pumping plant.  The Cutter Lateral obtains water from Cutter Reservoir, an existing regulating reservoir on the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project.  

B.  Hydraulic Data
1.	WTP
The WTP will be designed and built for the 2020 demand with the capability of being expanded for the 2040 demand (Table 1).  The influent /effluent difference assumes an approximate 4% required maximum loss through the WTP.

Table 1:  Year 2020 and 2040 water demands
Units	Demand	2020	2040
		Influent	Effluent	Influent	Effluent
MGD	Maximum Day	4.0	3.8	5.6	5.4
	Average Day	3.1	3.0	4.3	4.2
	Minimum Month	2.5	2.4	3.5	3.3

2.	Pumping Plant
Pumping Plant shall be designed for sufficient head (420 feet) to pump water to proposed operating storage tank elevations at the following flow rates (Table 2):


Table 2:  Year 2020 and 2040 pumping plant flow rates
Year	Units
	(CFS)	(GPM)
2020	5.9	2,700
2040	8.3	3,800





C.  Water Quality Data
1.	Raw Water Quality
The source water is a reservoir with a good water quality.  See the 4/6/2015 water sample highlighted water quality results (Table 3).

Table 3:  Highlighted water quality results (4/6/2015 sample)

	Analyte	Value	Units
General	Alkalinity (Total)	81	mg/L
	DOC	2.5	mg/L
	Hardness	101	mg/L as CaCO3
	pH	8.1	
	TDS	160	mg/L
	TOC	2.6	mg/L
	TSS	4.5	mg/L
	Turbidity	4.5	NTU
	UV	0.079	cm-1
Ions	Arsenic	0.001	mg/L
	Bromide	<0.2	mg/L
	Chloride	<10	mg/L
	Iron	0.14	mg/L
	Manganese	0.002	mg/L
	Sodium	15	mg/L
	Sulfate	45	mg/L

2.	Finished Water Quality
a.	Finished water must meet all USEPA primary and secondary drinking water standards.  
b.	The primary finished water quality parameter of concern is natural organic matter and the resulting disinfection byproduct formation.  This is due to the long distribution system length.  
c.	The finished water DOC concentration will need to be approximately 0.5 mg/L.

D.  Treatment Constraints 
1.	96% overall WTP water recovery
2.	Use of chloramines is not permitted

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)


1.	Contracting Activity:

Department of Veterans Affairs 
Network Contract Office 12, NCO 12
Great Lakes Acquisition Center
115 South 84th Street, Suite 101
Milwaukee, WI 53214-1476

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:

The Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital, Hines Illinois, has a need for a new Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to award OI&T Data Drop construction projects.  Task Orders awarded under the IDIQ will be awarded as firm-fixed price actions. The period of performance will be one year and the contract will have a Not-to-Exceed amount of $500,000.00. Task Orders will be issued between $2,500.00 and $500,000.00
For this new requirement, NCO 12 proposes to establish a firm fixed price contract with Industria Inc., a Center for Enterprise (CVE) Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) under the Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition FAR 6.302-5. P. L. 109-461 by a Request for Proposal RFP under FAR Part 15.   

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet Agency Needs:
The Hines VA Hospital has a requirement for NRM and station level Telecommunication and Data Drop projects including, but not limited to, the management, design, materials, labor, and equipment to construct and/or renovate all structure, architecture, and utility features as required to perform the installation of voice and data communication lines.  Cutting or drilling walls for jack box installations.  Terminating and certifying cable ends, installing faceplates and numbering systems, and providing CAD as-built drawings.  Pulling the physical transmission cabling, installing conduit and hangers, providing fire rated wall penetrations for cable runs, and installing and removing Infection Control measures per facility requirements

Required Delivery Date: ASAP-The facility OI&T has numerous projects that need to be awarded during the 1st and 2nd Quarter of Fiscal Year 2016. The most recent award for Data-Drop and telecommunications expires on 16 November 2015, eleven calendar days from today.  The station has requested a $3 million dollar, one year, IDIQ with 3 option years.  They plan to submit a complete acquisition package to the GLAC no later than 15 June 2016.  In the interim, the station has no telecommunication IDIQ contract vehicle in place.  This sole source IDIQ to Industria Inc. is intended to bridge the gap between now and June 2016 when the IDIQ IFB is awarded.  The station already has three Station Level projects that are planned to be awarded under this IDIQ.  


4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
In accordance with 41 USC 3304(a)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1:

(X)    FAR 6.302-5:  Authorized or Required by Statute

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

Public Law 109-461 and VAAR 819.7007 allows a contracting officer to make a sole source award as a business decision within the business discretion of the contracting officer. Although Industria Inc. is not the only SDVOSB contractor, it has been determined in the best interest of the government to award this contractor an IDIQ contract in order to meet NRM and station level award goals and any other emergency task orders that may come up between now and June 2016.  Industria Inc. is registered as a CVE verified SDVOSB in VetBiz.  They have performed well on their most recent contracts at the Hines VAH, as well as their last six similar contracts at the Jesse Brown VAH, Chicago, and the Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital, Hines, Illinois.  Industria Inc. has extensive knowledge of the Hines VA Hospital infrastructure.  


6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

There were no other vendors considered, as it is in the best interest of the Government to
award this project as a sole source award and is authorized by statute, VAAR Part 819.7007 and 819.7008 Sole Source Awards to SDVOSB and FAR 6.302.  The anticipated award price of the contract will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403)) but will not exceed $500,000.00.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

An Independent Government Estimate (IGE) will be prepared for each task order. A detailed cost breakdown will be provided by the contractor.  The Government will perform price analysis of each task order. Costs will be evaluated to determine that the proposed price is fair and reasonable and reflects reasonable value. Historical costs will also be utilized. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:

A search utilizing NAICS code 238210 was conducted to determine if other qualified CVE SDVOSB contractors would be able to meet the needs of this project. The VET Biz Registry - https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/ website was utilized. The search resulted in the identification of 697 CVE SDVOSB companies of which 31 were located in Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan. A further review of recent bid openings for VISN 12 solicitations indicated that between 6-12 qualified CVE SDVOSB have submitted offers.  Although there are other CVE SDVOSB listed under the applicable NAICS code, it is the contracting officer's determination that it is in the best interest of the Government to procure the construction services as a sole-source procurement.  Industria Inc. is still onsite completing another telecommunication contract.  As such, they are already mobilized and are expected to save the government the time and cost of mobilizing a new contractor.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:

Industria Inc. is already mobilized on site at the Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital for the completion of VA69D-15-P-5227 - Installing Data Drops.  Industria Inc. has completed other projects at several of the facilities in VISN-12 and provided exceptional service at a fair and reasonable price.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: None

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  


13.	Approvals in accordance with the VHAPM, Volume 6, Chapter VI: OFOC SOP.


a.	Contracting Officer's Certification (required): I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Based on 41 U.S.C .&sect;3304(a)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a), the existing Leased location near the University of Oklahoma's Max Weistheimer Airport is the only source that will satisfy the requirement of the National Severe Storms Laboratory, National Weather Testbed (NWRT), and Phased Aray Radar (PAR) function.
<p>GSAM 570.402-5 allows for negotiation with the current lessor when a cost-benefit analysis shows that the Government cannot expect to recover relocation and replication costs through competition. The results of the Cost-Benefit Analysis done for this site are contained in the table below. For purpose of this analysis the low and high-end of the target rental range established by the market survey were used. Also, per guidance from the NSSL, a site relocation cost of $2,000,000 was used.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1.	ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
VA251-16-AP-0645	1A. PROJECT/TASK No. N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$18,466.22
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Steam Conditioning Filter housing with trap for all Steam Sterilizers. 

Getinge USA, Inc., 1777 E. Henrietta Rd., Rochester, NY 14623.


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Emergency Order - Getinge is the equipment that requires this filter and is only filter option specified by vendor warranty.  
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Getinge washer is the machine that is used to clean instruments in order to sterilize products that are used in patient surgeries. Ann Arbor had to stop surgeries because the Getinge washing machine has been leaving particles on the instruments. This part is needed to not further delay patient care and cancel additional surgeries. 

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Due to the urgent nature of this request, market research was not conducted. 


6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.

1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID:
VA251-16-AP-0650	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER  N/A
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$4,284.80
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Sole Source Procurement of the following: Vendor to provide 1 GUI PCB circuit card (p/n 10075675) to the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center for an 840 Ventilator. The vendor is Covidien at 15 Hampshire Street, Mansfield, MA 02048.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
Covidien, the OEM, is the sole provider of software to run this circuit board and will not upload software on circuit boards that have not been purchased through their company. 
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Covidien, the OEM, is the sole provider of software to run this circuit board and will not upload software on circuit boards that have not been purchased through their company.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
No attempts were made to solicit other sources due to the proprietary nature of the circuit board required. In the past, an attempt was made to obtain a non-Covidien board at a reduced rate, but Covidien refused to load the needed software onto the board. The supplier of the board was unable to provide or load the needed software.

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
