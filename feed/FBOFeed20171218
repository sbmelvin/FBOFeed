This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), AJW-E13C COMM ENG CTR-ATL has a requirement for the Replacement of Four (4) Towers at Raleigh, NC (RDU) - RTR. All interested Small businesses are encouraged to submit a response to this market survey.

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendorâs expense.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of fulfilling this requirement.

The contract is planned for Raytheon (cage code 70SQ8) of Marlborough, MA under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C.
 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, âOnly one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.â  
Raytheon is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical expertise to provide this part, since Raytheon is the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the E-2D Mission Computer component parts. The anticipated award date is April 2018 with delivery 15 months after contract award.  The anticipated contract value for this procurement is $1.05M total.
Raytheon designed these spare parts to aircraft specifications and remains as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) who can meet the form, fit, function requirements necessary for timely delivery.
  Ongoing market research performed by the Government supports there does not exist a commercially available item or non-developmental item to satisfy the Governmentâs requirement.  Additionally, the Small Business Office concurred with the decision to sole source to the OEM (Raytheon). 

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice confirming the Governmentâs intent to contract on a sole source basis with Raytheon.  Interested sources are solicited to provide their written technical capabilities.  Written response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  Interested sources must submit detailed written technical capabilities to deliver the E-2D Mission Computer kit spares to meet the needs of the Government.
  Detailed written capabilities must be submitted by email to Ms. Romy Roman-Conway (romy.roman-conway@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Microsoft Office 2010 applications (MS Word), no later than 1 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Tuesday, 02 January 2018. Verbal submissions via phone will not be honored. 
All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
 This notice is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government. If no written challenge to this synopsis is received, a justification and approval (J and A) for other than full and open competition in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.303 based on the rationale provided above will be initiated. If conducted as a sole source procurement, a separate synopsis will not follow.
 This synopsis will satisfy the intent of the requirements under FAR 5.201 and 5.204. In accordance with FAR 5.102(e), copies of the solicitation will be available upon request.

<DESC>This synopsis precedes the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) entitled,  Wilmington VAMC and Coatesville VAMC Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC)  for construction services.  The subsequent contracts will be performed for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Wilmington VA Medical Center, Wilmington, Delaware and Coatesville VA Medical Center, Coatesville, PA.  As a result of the solicitation, the Government intends that approximately six (6) indefinite-deliveries, indefinite-quantity, (IDIQ) Task Order Contracts will be awarded providing six (6) awardable proposals are submitted. This is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set aside.   Contractors must be registered in the US Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Biz Database to be eligible to submit a proposal.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/. Contractors must be verified as a SDVOSB to be eligible for award.  Contractors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/#1 to be eligible for award.  Additionally, contractors must have a Dun and Bradstreet Number, must file a Vet-4212 at www.dol.gov/vets/vets4212.htm. The applicable NAICS codes for this acquisition include 236 Construction of Buildings and 238 Specialty Trade Contractors.  While it is anticipated that the majority of the task order projects will be under the 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, the MATOC will have the flexibility to also be used for specialty construction projects, such as plumbing and electrical. The size standards are $36.5 million and $15.0 respectively in average annual receipts.   Awards will be made to offerors whose proposals are responsive and conforming to the RFP, and are also determined to be most advantageous to the Government in terms of Technical, Past Performance, and Price. Work to be performed under the MATOC contract(s) will include construction projects.  Typical work includes, but is not limited to: interior and exterior renovations and alterations, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, heating and air-conditioning, HVAC controls, fire suppression, and intrusion alarms, communications, limited utilities, site-work, landscaping, fencing, masonry, roofing, concrete, asphalt, paving, storm drainage, limited environmental remediation, construction of new facilities, demolition, surveys, design/build and other related work.  Projects will principally be design/bid/build type from already completed designs, or projects specified by a statement of work using the VA Master Specifications. All contract work shall be completed through individual task orders awarded for individual projects at the Wilmington VA Medical Center, and Coatesville VA Medical Center campuses.  Each task order will be priced individually and will include its own Department of Labor General Decision and magnitude of construction cost.  These task orders will be competed amongst the MATOC IDIQ awardees only.  The maximum cumulative amount for all six contracts is $100,000,000.00. The minimum and maximum values for a single Task Order are $2,000 and $5.5 Million, respectively. The maximum value of the entire MATOC will not exceed $100,000,000 over the life of the contract. There are no options. The MATOC will come to an end when the cumulative amount of all task orders reaches $100,000,000. The MATOC s minimum order amount is $5,000 or if no task order project is awarded, a guaranteed $5,000 will be paid to the contractor. The minimum fee will only be paid if the awarded contractor continues to compete for, but is not awarded, a task order throughout the life of the contract.  Task orders may be solicited as an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or as a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government reserves the right to issue additional solicitations and award construction contracts within the activities covered by the proposed MATOC contracts to contractors other than those awarded a contract under this solicitation. This is not a solicitation for a Requirements Contract.  The anticipated release date for the Solicitation is on or about Jan 3, 2018.  The solicitation will be posted at this website, www.fbo.gov. All inquiries shall be submitted by e-mail to Mr. Mike White at michael.white9@va.gov.

<SUBJECT>Maintenance Dredging of Newark Bay, New Jersey Federal Navigation Project
<SOLNBR>W912DS18B0006

<DESC>The New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposes to perform maintenance dredging of portions of the Newark Bay, New Jersey Federal Navigation Project.  The dredged material would be processed and subsequently transported to and placed at a contractor furnished, State permitted upland placement site(s). The proposed maintenance dredging would remove approximately 230,000 cubic yards (CY) of selected critical shoals from the Main, South Elizabeth, and Port Elizabeth Channels of Newark Bay.  Dredging in these channels would be required to a depth of -50 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 1 foot allowable overdepth. In addition, approximately 475,000 CY of selected shoals from the Main and Port Newark Channels of Newark Bay would be required.  Dredging in these channels would be required to a depth of -40 feet MLLW plus 1 foot allowable overdepth.  A total of approximately 705,000 CY of dredged material (the majority of which is expected to be the basic work, and the remaining quantity would be an option(s)) would be required to be removed. The dredged material is expected to consist primarily of silt and clay.<br /><br />Due to restrictions found in the water quality certificate, the proposed work can only be performed by utilizing a mechanical dredge with a closed clamshell environmental bucket. Additionally, multiple barges and tug boats will be needed to perform the work during the dredging, dewatering and unloading operations. The dredged material would be required to meet all federal, state, and approved local criteria required by the government agencies having jurisdiction where the placement site is located. All necessary permits required for the dredged material placement will be provided by the contractor to the government.<br /><br />The apparent low bidder shall, within 35 calendar days from the date the apparent low bidder is notified of being such, provide copies of all required permits and approvals for transfer, transportation, dewatering and / or other processing, and final placement of dredged material, and shall submit evidence of such permits and approvals to the government.  Bidders should consult with Section 00 73 00 paragraph 1.3 of the specifications for all submittal requirements.<br /><br />Once the contract is awarded, the contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him of the notice to proceed, and maintain an integrated production rate of at least 2,500 cubic yards per calendar day for the dredging, transfer, transportation, dewatering and / or other processing, and final placement of the material.  The presence of dredging equipment in the channel will impact ship traffic, and it is necessary to maintain this production rate while minimizing the duration of this impact.<br /><br />Plans and specifications for the subject project would be available in February 2018, with bid opening in March 2018.  It is the intention of the government to award in May 2018 and the proposed work is anticipated to take place between June 2018 and March 2019.  The work is estimated to cost between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.<br /><br />Liquidated Damages of $2,023.00 per calendar day of delay will be assessed to the contractor until all work under the contract is accepted as complete.<br /><br />This is an unrestricted Procurement.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information: Hydrogen Compressor Manufacturing Capabilities
<SOLNBR>RGJ-8-82090
<RESPDATE>020118
<CONTACT>Joann Sheldon, Sr. Subcontract Administrator, Email joann.sheldon@nrel.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) No. RGJ-8-82090<br />"Hydrogen Compressor Manufacturing Capabilities"<br />December 12, 2017
<p><br />INTRODUCTION<br />The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is one of the U.S. Department of Energy's national laboratories for renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development. NREL develops renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies and practices, advances related science and engineering, and transfers knowledge and innovations to address the nation's energy and environmental goals.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE<br />NREL is seeking feedback from manufacturers on hydrogen compressor manufacturing capability that meet specifications that may satisfy future needs of hydrogen station requirements. The general requirements for all of the systems that follow are that the compressors are hydrogen compatible and maintain high product purity. For all of the systems described below, information on cost, efficiency (kWh/kg), balance of plant requirements (cooling, electrical power, etc.), noise level, footprint and any general comments on the type of systems is requested. The information received will be used to assess the most efficient and cost-effective equipment configurations available as well as identify the current hydrogen equipment manufacturing capabilities. The goal of this RFI is to identify potential collaborations for future testing and evaluation of hydrogen compressors.</p>
<p>Variable Flow Compressor<br />Often, compressors operate best when long duty cycles are imposed. Frequent starting and stopping creates stress on the mechanical components that could lead to early failure. This creates a challenge when pairing a compressor with a variable production source, such as renewables. A successful compressor would be able to vary its flow from 10 - 100% in response times that match the flow of a variable hydrogen production source. Expected transient response from the compressor is expected to be in the 1 Hz range to meet highly variable production needs. In this concept the compressor is fed by an electrolyzer direct connected to renewables or participating in grid services, both yielding variable production. One benefit of a compressor that can match the variable flow rate of an electrolyzer is the reduction of the volume of permanent buffer storage which would currently be required.</p>
<p>The systems below contain specifications that are expected to meet required performance for variable flow compressors. Please specify which system number you are commenting on when providing feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Variable Flow Systems</p>
<p>1 - Low Flow System<br />&bull; Inlet Pressure Range: 100 - 400 psig (7 - 28 barg)<br />&bull; Maximum Outlet Pressure: 5,000 - 6,500 psig (345 - 448 barg)<br />&bull; Flow Rate Range: 10 - 100 kg/day (10 - 100%)</p>
<p>2 - MW Size Electrolyzer<br />&bull; Inlet Pressure Range: 100 - 400 psig (7 - 28 barg)<br />&bull; Maximum Outlet Pressure: 5,000 - 6,500 psig (345 - 448 barg)<br />&bull; Maximum Flow Rate: 40 - 400 kg/day (10 - 100%)</p>
<p>3 - Multi-MW Large System<br />&bull; Inlet Pressure Range: 100 - 400 psig (7 - 28 barg)<br />&bull; Maximum Outlet Pressure: 5,000 - 6,500 psig (345 - 448 barg)<br />&bull; Maximum Flow Rate: 400 - 4,000 kg/day (10 - 100%)</p>
<p>High Throughput Compressor<br />As FCEV penetration increases and demand for hydrogen increases, future hydrogen stations will require multiple fueling positions for simultaneous fueling of FCEV. These high throughput stations will require either multiple compressors or one large compressor onsite to handle the high flow rates associated with hydrogen fueling. Compressors may be fed from on-site storage, on site production or pipelines. The following concepts highlight some of the needs in this space.</p>
<p>High Throughput Systems</p>
<p>4 - Medium to High Pressure Booster<br />&bull; Inlet Pressure Range: 2,000 - 6,000 psig (138 - 414 barg)<br />&bull; Maximum Outlet Pressure: 12,500 - 14,000 psig (862 - 965 barg)<br />&bull; Maximum Flow Rate: 1,440 - 4,320 kg/day (1 - 3 kg/min)</p>
<p>5 - Low to High Pressure Compressor<br />&bull; Inlet Pressure Range: 300 - 1,000 psig (21 - 69 barg)<br />&bull; Maximum Outlet Pressure: 12,500 - 14,000 psig (862 - 965 barg)<br />&bull; Maximum Flow Rate: 1,440 - 4,320 kg/day (1 - 3 kg/min)</p>
<p>6 - Medium or Heavy Duty Applications<br />&bull; Inlet Pressure Range: 300 - 1,000 psig (21 - 69 barg)<br />&bull; Maximum Outlet Pressure: 6,000 - 7,000 psig (414 - 483 barg)<br />&bull; Maximum Flow Rate: 1,440 - 4,320 kg/day (1 - 3 kg/min)</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION, NOT A SOURCES SOUGHT OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. VERBAL RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. ALL INQUIRIES MUST BE PROVIDED IN WRITING VIA E-MAIL.</p>
<p>Responses are requested not later than close of business, 02/01/18 via email to Joann Sheldon (joann.sheldon@nrel.gov). Telephone calls will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The response is limited to 8 pages of single spaced text of 12-point font or equivalent, with minimum 1" margins all around. Brevity is encouraged.<br />The response shall include:<br />&bull; Name and address of the company<br />&bull; Point of contact including name, title, phone and email address</p>

<p><strong>1. RFI Announcement</strong><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to understand the landscape of vendors, including both those that currently hold contracts on government vehicles and those that do not, that can provide the type of service outlined below. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract, nor do they affect a potential respondent's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation which may or may not follow or restrict the government's eventual acquisition approach. Additionally, the government will not provide reimbursement for any information submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided; however, information gathered may be utilized for future technical and acquisition purposes.</p>
<p><strong>2. Background</strong><br />The U.S. Citizen Immigration Services (USCIS) Office of Information Technology (OIT) has a need for information regarding forward-thinking, modern Development, Security, and Operations (DEVSECOPs) services. These services would be provided to build, enhance, and support systems in large cloud environments,specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS), but potentially other cloud environments as well, such as Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. This request does not extend to services provided by or in vendor hosted private cloud environments. Information is requested about services that would be delivered using agile practices, a microservices approach and using a Continuous (code) Integration/Continuous Delivery Pipeline and Open Source tools.</p>
<p>The objective of potential future contracts or vehicles is to provide DEVSECOP services across the enterprise and within DHS to support the mission. The services provided would meet the technical architecture and design specified by the government.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this RFI is to identify sources that have staff currently available to meet the needs of these potential future requirements.</p>
<p><strong>3. Questions to Industry</strong></p>
<p>1) Discuss the size, scope, complexity, and number of IT projects (both federal and non- federal) your company has supported using Agile processes and a DEVSECOPs CI/CD model in a cloud environment. Specifically, discuss projects developed using pure open source technology in AWS or comparable cloud environments (e.g. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud); specifically, these projects should be in production environments, not development or experimental in nature. The government is most interested in projects where your company acted as the prime contractor and developer. If your company has this experience in which it performed at least 30% of the work or provided at least 15 personnel, this experience can also be listed but must be noted, including your company's specific role in the project (e.g., DEVOPs engineers, Developers, PM support, etc.). Open Source technologies used must include, at a minimum, at least one from each category below.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Programming Languages <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Java<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 - Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a separate written solicitation document will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued under the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. <br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-95 effective 1/19/2017.<br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325120 with a small business size standard of 1,000 Employees. This acquisition is being procured as a Total Small Business Set Aside. Only quotes submitted by qualified small business concerns will be considered.<br /><br />Delivery<br />The 1000L microbulk Ar tank shall be delivered, installed and filled no later than 10 days after the date of award. The items shall be shipped F.O.B. Destination to: <br />NIST Charleston Laboratory<br />Hollings Marine Laboratory<br />331 Ft. Johnson Rd. <br />Charleston, SC 29412<br /><br />FOB DESTINATION MEANS: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.<br /><br />EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD<br />The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Contractor whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is the lowest price, technically acceptable quotation.<br />Technically acceptable means that the Contractor provides a microbulk Ar tank and Argon that meets the requirements specified in the Statement of Work, and the requirements of all Line Items and option years. If a Contractor does not indicate how its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.  A top and bottom fill piping circuit is required to maintain gas line pressure and eliminate the need to install and use backup high pressure argon cylinders during liquid fill events. Contractors that propose to provide any tank solution that requires the use of backup, high pressure argon cylinders to avoid the requirement to provide a new tank equipped with a top and bottom fill piping circuit will be rejected as unacceptable.  <br /><br />Price will be evaluated to determine that total price is consistent with the technical portion of the quotation and is a fair and reasonable overall price to the Government.<br />NIST intends to evaluate quotes and issue a contract based on the initial quotes received. Therefore, the Contractor's initial quote should contain the Contractor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. NIST reserves the right to request revised quotes from, or negotiate final contract terms with, one or more, but not all, Contractors if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.<br /><br />REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS<br />All Contractors shall submit the following:<br />1. For the purpose of evaluation of Technical Acceptability: Documentation that confirms the contractor is capable of providing the supplies specified in the statement of work.
<p>2. Contractors shall provide pricing for the following line items and option years.<br />Base Year: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Line Item 1: Required Specifications for Liquid Argon:<br />Critical Assay-99.999%<br />Meets ICP-MS Specification<br />Oxygen-&lt; 2 ppm<br />Total Hydrocarbons (as CH4)-&lt; 0.5 ppm<br />Nitrogen-&lt; 10 ppm <br />Carbon Dioxide-&lt; 0.5 ppm<br />Water-&lt; 5 ppm<br />Carbon Monoxide-&lt; 0.5 ppm <br />Hydrogen-&lt; 2 ppm <br />Valve Material-Solid Brass and Stainless Steel are acceptable<br />Line Item 2: Delivery Requirements and Minimum Tank Levels.</p>

If the telemetry system fails or is out of order, it shall be repaired or replaced by the Contractor as outlined in Section I. Gas delivery orders shall be called in by phone when repairs are delayed.<br />The following minimum levels shall be maintained at all times for the microbulk Tank: 20% of the total capacity.<br />Option Year I: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Option Year II: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Option Year III: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Option Year IV: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />3.

Contractors shall provide an active DUNS # for the System for Award Management (SAM) registration.<br /><br />6. If the Contractor's representations and certifications in SAM.gov do not reflect the NAICS code governing this solicitation, Contractors must submit documentation that they are a small business under the NAICS code governing this solicitation.<br />Please note that this procurement IS NOT being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If a contractor submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation;<br /><br />DUE DATE FOR QUOTATIONS<br />All quotations must be submitted via e-mail to Wendy Paulo, Contracting Officer at Wendy.Paulo@nist.gov.

<DESC>Description:<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding:( 1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background: <br />The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Office of the Director (OD) National Children's Study (NCS) seek capability statements from interested and qualified potential sources for the National Children's Study (NCS) Biological and Environmental Sample Repository.</p>
<p>The National Children's Study (NCS) Vanguard Data Archive and Access System ("NCS Archive") was made available for public use earlier this year at https://ncsarchive.s-3.net. NICHD requires contractor services to maintain and manage the NCS Repository of Biological and Environmental Samples. <br /><br />The NCS Vanguard was a pilot for a planned cohort study of environmental influences on child health and development. Starting in 2009, recruitment strategies were tested in 43 counties across 31 states throughout the U.S. The study enrolled over 5,600 birth families and followed them through 2014. At protocol-specified study visits, questionnaires and interviews, neuro-psychosocial and cognitive assessments, and physical examination data were collected, along with nearly 19,000 biological and 5,500 environmental primary samples from which a sample repository of over 250,000 items was created. That information and material now will be available through the NCS Archive for approved research projects by qualified investigators. <br />NCS developed and implemented procedures designed to minimize variability in specimen handling through standardized collection, local transport, shipping, central processing, aliquoting, and short- and long-term storage. In general, samples in the NCS collection are pristine, and frozen samples have been subject to no more than a single freeze-thaw cycle at the time of central processing.</p>
<p>The materials collected comprise the following primary sample types: <br />&bull; Biological Samples: Blood, urine, vaginal secretions, umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord tissue, placenta, meconium, breast milk, saliva, hair, and nails <br />&bull; Environmental Samples: Air, dust, and water</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">PURPOSE:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing an RFI on behalf of the Support Ships, Boats, and Craft Program Office (PMS 325), to seek feedback on the attached Specification and assess the availability of qualified, small businesses that would bid on a procurement for Expeditionary 11 Meter Rigid Inflatable Boats (RIBs) with the Expeditionary Mine Counter Measure (ExMCM) configuration and Expeditionary 11 Meter RIBs with the Very Shallow Water (VSW) configuration, as described below. This RFI will assist the Navy in finding qualified, small business sources to build the RIBs. Only U.S. built vessels will be considered.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">DESCRIPTION &amp; MISSION PROFILE:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">With the emergent establishment of an enduring, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mine Countermeasure Platoon (EOD MCM PLT), Very Shallow Water operations (VSW) and MK 18 UUV family of systems (FoS) capability for near-term operational missions, an Expeditionary variant of the 11m RIB is required. Highest priority is placed on fielding the MK 18 Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) Family of Systems (FoS), with associated Expeditionary 11m RIB variants to conduct assigned missions. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">A configuration of the Expeditionary 11m RIB equipped with a vehicle Launch, Recovery, and Handling (LR&amp;H) system for interface with the MK 18 Mod 2 UUV will be referred herein as the ExMCM configuration. This configuration will have the capability to launch, recover, and handle two (2) UUVs using two (2) davits and two (2) vehicle stowage cradles located in the aft deck of the boat for Mine Counter Measure (MCM) operations. </span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">TBMCS is a United States Air Force (USAF) led program, with joint interest. TBMCS serves as the focal point for Joint Air Warfare Command and Control (C2), integrating systems for planning, tasking, intelligence-gathering and execution into a single, common interface. It is the primary system for planning, managing and executing the air battle, feeding real-time, decision-quality information to users from the Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) and the staff at the Air Operations Command (AOC) to pilots, navigators, and weapons control officers on the battlefield. TBMCS links the command and control systems for the USAF, United States Navy (USN), and USMC, and integrates with ground systems for the United States Army systems, enabling coordinated, synchronized air battle management. The program is post Milestone C and in sustainment. Software sustainment and post production life cycle support of TBMCS is currently being performed by Lockheed Martin Corporation in Colorado Springs, CO. The government intends to sunset TBMCS by the end of fiscal year 2023 (September 23). TBMCS software is approximately 4 million lines of code, comprised of various programming languages (Ada, Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE), C, C++, Perl, Unix Shell Scripts, SQL, Ant, Batch Code, Visual Basic, and AWK).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, TBMCS software uses multiple specific compilers and libraries for legacy UNIX applications, including Sun C++ compiler, Forte Developer 7 C++ 5.4 2002/03/09, Sun C compiler, Forte Developer 7 C 5.4 2002/03/09, KL Group XRT Table v2.2.1, Field v1.1.0, Gear widgets, v2.0.1, etc. Operating systems include Solaris 10, Windows 10, Windows Server 2012, and middleware consisting of Oracle 9i/12c, Oracle WebLogic Server 12c, Systematic IRIS, and Java Runtime Environment 1.6, with compatibility to Java 1.6. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>USMC sustainment efforts require integration with USAF/Joint sustainment efforts to maintain backwards and forwards interoperability. TBMCS sustainment support must be accomplished without compromising joint TBMCS performance and functionality, and without compromising the Cybersecurity posture of the system. </span></p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong>:</p>
<p>The USDA, ARS, NLAE was constructed in 1986 as the National Soil Tilth Laboratory on the Iowa State University (ISU) campus. The HVAC and related systems were Johnson Controls (JCI) pneumatic controls and operated the building HVAC systems, heat recovery systems, growth and root environmental control chamber systems, and room HVAC controls for laboratories, offices, and support spaces. The JCI equipment also monitors security, fire, and central utilities provided from the campus systems and alarms are reported to the ISU campus security and/or building automation controls group.</p>
<p>Approximately twenty years ago the ISU facilities group replaced the pneumatic systems and controls with the JCI Direct Digital Controls (DDC). The pneumatic controls were upgraded to the current campus standard, which is the JCI Metasys system that operates on the Extended Architecture Platform. The ISU building automation controls group provides automation service management for the NLAE automation systems and maintains the JCI system software on their servers. The NLAE building manager is authorized to assess to the campus BAS to monitor, trend, adjust building automation set-points in the NLAE building. The control programming for the building resides in a combination of local controllers and the JCI Metasys servers outside of the building, where it is also backed up. The building JCI controls are connected to the campus servers via a dedicated Ethernet connection. ISU maintains the expertise to manage and program the JCI Metasys EA system for all campus buildings (more than one hundred), including NLAE.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intent to Sole Source Project Scope Description</span></strong>:</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent to Sole Source is issued for informational purposes only. The USDA, ARS intends to procure the BAS portion of the overall contract to JCI. At the completion of this project, all of the pneumatic controls in NLAE will have been converted to JCI Metasys control that will conform to the ISU standards for building automation, assuring USDA will retain the current relationship with ISU to monitor and support the existing building automation systems in the building and to be able to provide back-up service without USDA purchasing additional hardware, software, and/or requirements to provide additional specialized training to USDA or ISU personnel.</p>
<p>The programming and hardware for the project generally includes HVAC systems, including VAV box controllers, VFD controllers, pump controllers, thermostats humidistats, fume hood controls, fans for supply, return, exhaust, and heat recovery, steam actuators, chilled water control valves and chilled water control systems for plant growth and root (rhizotron) environmental growth chambers. All points will be programmed into the central campus building automation system and configured in accordance with the ISU Building Automation Standards. All hardware will be fully compatible with the ISU requirements.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting the sole sourcing of the proprietary products manufactured by JCI is in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." This is specifically implemented by FAR 6.302-1(c)(1), "Application for brand-name descriptions." An acquisition or portion of an acquisition that uses a brand-name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand-name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer." Johnson Controls are sole source and proprietary products.</p>

<DESC>The Division of Contract Services (DCS), on behalf of the Department of Labor / Employment and Training Administration (ETA), intends to award a Sole Source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to St. Louis and Associates.
<p>The Unemployment Insurance (UI) system, as established by the Social Security Act of 1935, is a unique Federal-state system grounded in Federal law, but executed in its relationship to the employer and to the unemployed worker through state law. Federal law provides the broad parameters for the program and individual state laws establish specific financing and benefit payment structures.</p>
<p>The Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) of the U.S. Department of Labor is the Federal partner in the system. Its role is one of overall oversight and coordination, including ensuring conformity of state laws to Federal requirements, measurement of state performance, and providing for the administrative expenses of the program.</p>
<p>The Division of Fiscal and Actuarial Services (DFAS) in conjunction with the Division of Performance Management (DPM) of the OUI have several responsibilities in the UI system. Some of the most important are: providing technical assistance to states on benefit financing and profiling, producing budget and legislative estimates and analyses, monitoring Federal trust fund accounts, publishing statistical reports, providing for administrative financing, overseeing state program performance, and providing technical expertise and statistical and analytical support for OUI initiatives.</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to provide the OUI needed support in carrying out its responsibilities:</p>
<p>Budget and Legislative Analysis</p>
<p>1. The contractor shall maintain, monitor and improve computer models used to make Federal budget and legislative estimates. The contractor will have responsibility for the revenue and state loan model, which makes state-by-state projections of tax rates, fund balances, loans, etc. The contractor will also have responsibility for the STUBEN regular benefits model, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) model and the Extended Benefits (EB) model. The contractor shall use these models to make budget and legislative estimates as required. Model equations must be reviewed and updated annually. The contractor shall review and assess alternative techniques and methodologies for modeling and projecting key UI program variables. All model changes must be documented.</p>
<p>2. The contractor shall produce actuarial calculations on a monthly and quarterly basis for the DOL financial statements. These include estimated UTF disbursements for all programs, due and payable accruals for all programs, and existing claims accruals for Federal UI programs. The contractor shall also produce information annually for the Required Supplemental Information attachment to the financial statements, including 10-year projections of UTF balances under various economic scenarios and an assessment of state trust fund solvency.</p>
<p>Profiling Model Technical Assistance</p>
<p><br />3. The contractor shall assist DFAS in providing technical assistance and support to states and Regional Offices in developing, implementing, maintaining and updating statistical models or characteristic screening systems for identifying claimants likely to exhaust benefits. Technical assistance will be performed either via telephone or on-site, as determined by the COR. Technical assistance will include: identifying and analyzing state data sources and elements, determining model specifications and estimating model coefficients These tasks will be done either in coordination with state staff, for integrating the econometric model into existing UI software systems, or with Regional Office staff in reviewing and assessing state profiling systems.</p>
<p>Trust Fund Forecasting Technical Assistance</p>
<p>4. As needed, the contractor shall work with DFAS staff to provide support to SWAs in the task of forecasting UI trust fund balances using the BFM. This task entails developing and maintaining various UI-related regression equations used in the simulation models, modeling new state UI laws, collecting and setting up numerous input data files, running simulations under various economic scenarios, and providing technical support to state users. The contractor may also be required to assist in developing a prototype Excel version of the BFM.</p>
<p>5. The contractor shall produce a single one-week Benefit Financing Seminar during the project period, for approximately thirty participants from SWAs. Topics will include: UI cost and revenue forecasting, UI tax structures, experience rating, measuring trust fund solvency, Title XII loans, and basic statistical methods. Hands-on use of the BFM will be emphasized. The contractor shall provide all training materials and supplies and will coordinate logistics. Contract staff shall prepare presentations jointly with Federal staff. The COR will determine seminar dates and specific course content.</p>
<p>Reports</p>
<p>6. The contractor shall prepare a quarterly publication, the UI Data Summary, which provides a detailed comparison of the status of states with respect to unemployment rates, benefit payment activities, revenues, and trust fund reserves. The publication shall be made available both in hard copy and on the OUI website. The contractor shall maintain and document routines used to extract data, manipulate data, and produce the report. The contractor shall respond to requests for data related to this report or other UI data from researchers, Congressional staff, etc.</p>
<p>7. The contractor shall publish official five-year UI projections and Federal and state trust fund account status in the UI Outlook. These projections are updated twice a year in conjunction with the Federal budget process. The publication shall be made available both via email and on the OUI website. Routines and spreadsheets must be documented.</p>
<p>8. The contractor shall produce annual estimates of the CY 2017 amounts of FUTA taxes paid by employers in each state and compile data on the amounts returned to the states for administration and benefits. The contractor shall publish these data on the OUI website.</p>
<p>9. The contractor shall compute as required, state fund adequacy measures such as the Average High Cost Multiple and perform analyses of these measures as required. The contractor shall publish these data in a form determined by the COR.</p>
<p>Performance Management</p>
<p>10. Conduct data analysis that may be necessary for the implementation of strategies in the comprehensive strategic plan.</p>
<p>11. Assist in determining which recommendations from the BAM Methodology Evaluation study can be implemented and identify any limitations discovered as part of the data analysis.</p>
<p>12. After the review of the recommendations, develop plans and business requirements for the implementation.</p>
<p>13. Develop regression models for implementing new integrity-related performance measures.</p>
<p>14. Assist with the development of methodologies to determine appropriate targets for performance measures.</p>
<p>15. Develop presentation material on plans for implementation of recommendations.</p>
<p>16. Review the current Program Performance and determine if the current system should be enhanced based on current processes. This data analysis should look at all facets of the BAM program and determine which processes need to be improved.</p>
<p>17. Review all reporting mechanisms, forms and the tools used to determine if any corrections or changes need to be made.</p>
<p>This action will result in a Time and Material type contract with a twenty six (26) month period of performance. This notice of intent to award a Sole Source contract is not a request for competitive proposals. There is no solicitation document. No RFP will be available for competitive proposals. Phone calls will not be accepted. The anticipated award date is January 5, 2018.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Enterprise Assessments (EA) intends to issue a contract modification on a sole source basis under DE-HS0000100 with Chenega Support Services LLC (Chenega) for a full range of services for EAâs National Training Center (NTC). National Training Center performs the mission-critical support function of developing, maintaining, and delivering standardized health, safety, safeguards, security, and protective force training for DOE and National Nuclear Security Administrationâs Federal and contractor employees. This support includes developing, providing and supporting safety and security classroom and on-line training at the NTC and other locations, managing training programs, providing cyber-security and information technology support for the NTC as well as at DOE Headquarters in Washington, D.C., and maintaining the facilities and grounds. The modification extends the period of performance for five months, with a base period of two (2) months and three one (1) month option periods.

<DESC><br />The Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA), Camp Pendleton, CA, intends to issue a sole-source purchase order for Emergency Dive support for Amphibious Vehicle Test Branch (AVTB) from 1 January 2018 to 28 February 2018.
<p>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements" the Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed-Priced purchase order to Mark V Lodge, Inc. The 60-day duration of this effort and the required transition phase will not provide sufficient time for a new contractor/vendor to be familiarized with the operation, mission, and safety requirements which will create undue jeopardy to the testing requirements of AVTB. The Government has determined the award of this purchase order as the most cost effective and efficient action to avoid a substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition at this time.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. The point of contact for information regarding this notice is Roy P. Layug at roy.layug1@usmc.mil.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>JANUARY<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>15, 2018.</p>

<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Approved sources are: SIMS PUMP VALVE COMPANY, INC. 78314 <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>FOR PART, P/N NWK18436-V40.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Stethoscopes. Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MN-1701-20_Stethoscopes are eligible for participation. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong><br /><br />These Stethoscope products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. Vendors must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs, CARDINAL HEALTH and OWENS &amp; MINOR, to distribute through the PV Program. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MN-1701-20_Stethoscopes. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of three (3) years (36 months) from date of selection, with one (1) 24-month "option" period not to exceed a total of five (5) years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is 05 February 2018. Among vendors who are on QSL MN-1701-20_Stethoscopes, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Stethoscopes.<br /><br /><strong>Vendors agree to hold the submitted IA pricing firm for 75 days from the date specified for receipt of their IA offer. Notification of non-selection will be sent once the IA process is completed and the bilateral IA is signed.</strong><br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Stethoscopes. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $1,268,457 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL MN-1701-20_Stethoscopes who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below. </strong>In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO North via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, e-mail, or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</strong><br /><br />C. Source Selection Procedures<br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. The best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes if determined necessary.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full to the MMESO POCs by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendor part numbers, pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the subject QSL FBO. Vendors not currently on the subject QSL will not be considered for an IA. An IA will only be issued once the Vendor has established Fair and Reasonable base uncommitted DAPA prices for each product in the product line. Failure to establish approved DAPA base uncommitted prices will preclude a vendor from establishing an IA with the government. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</strong><br /><br />1. Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price.<br /><br /><strong>Required Products / Annual Usage in Units /</strong><br />
<p>5.1 STETHOSCOPE, DUAL HEAD CHESTPIECE, SINGLE LUMEN, 27-28 INCHES OVERALL LENGTH / 7752 /<br />5.2 STETHOSCOPE, DUAL HEAD CHESTPIECE, DOUBLE LUMEN, 27-28 INCHES OVERALL LENGTH / 2422 /<br />5.3 STETHOSCOPE, SINGLE HEAD CHESTPIECE, SINGLE LUMEN, 27-28 INCHES OVERALL LENGTH / 1694 /<br />5.4 STETHOSCOPE, INFANT, DUAL HEAD CHESTPIECE, 27-28 INCHES OVERALL LENGTH / 488 /<br />5.5 STETHOSCOPE, PEDIATRIC, DUAL HEAD CHESTPIECE, 27-28 INCHES OVERALL LENGTH / 270 /</p>
<p>2. Vendor may provide any or all of the additional items listed below, following the same format as for requirement number 1. Pricing for these additional items will not be part of the pricing computation for vendor selection. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Item Descriptions /</strong><br />1. STETHOSCOPE, ELECTRONIC, SINGLE HEAD CHESTPIECE, 27-28 INCHES OVERALL LENGTH /<br />2. STETHOSCOPE, SINGLE HEAD CHESTPIECE, DOUBLE LUMEN, 27-28 INCHES OVERALL LENGTH /<br />3. STETHOSCOPE, DISPOSABLE, SINGLE HEAD CHESTPIECE /<br />4. STETHOSCOPE, SINGLE HEAD CHESTPIECE, SINGLE LUMEN, &gt;28 INCHES OVERALL LENGTH /<br />5. STETHOSCOPE, SPRAGUE (DOUBLE TUBE), DUAL HEAD CHESTPIECE, 22 INCHES OVERALL LENGTH /<br />6. STETHOSCOPE, TEACHING, DUAL HEAD CHESTPIECE /<br />7. STETHOSCOPE, ADULT, DUAL HEAD CHESTPIECE /</p>
<p>3. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.</p>
<p>Note: DAPA holders must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical PVs to distribute through the PV Program. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to both PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." It is strongly recommended that participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items, whether they are deemed usage or non-usage by the MTFs, and factor PV costs into their offered IA tier pricing.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />52.246-2 - Inspection of Supplies -- Fixed-Price (Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />* * * * *<br />_X__52.204-7 -- System for Award Management (Oct 2016)<br />(a) Definitions.

<p><br />52.246-2 - Inspection of Supplies -- Fixed-Price (Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

This document is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.

 The evaluation of offers received in response to the solicitation will use a tiered or cascading order of precedence.  Tiered evaluation of offers,  also known as  cascading evaluation of offers,  is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when market research is inconclusive for justifying limiting competition to small business concerns or sub-categories of small business concerns. The contracting officer  
(1) Solicits offers from both small and other than small business concerns that will be evaluated in the following tier order: 
(a) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB); 
(b) veteran-owned small business (VOSB); 
(c) all other small business concerns; 
(d) other than small business. 
(2) If an award or a sufficient number of awards cannot be made at the first tier, evaluation of offers will proceed at the next lower tier until an award or a sufficient number of awards can be made. 
 
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit. Interested persons may submit offers, and all eligible offers received prior to 1:00 PM PDT December 22nd, 2017 will be considered by the Government. The NAICS code is 312113 and the size standard is 750 Employees. 
This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-89 effective, July 14, 2016.
Products shall be supplied in accordance with the specifications, terms and conditions contained herein. In addition, the following FAR and VAAR clauses will also apply. Thank you.

C.1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

Only electronic offer will be accepted. Offers are due by 1:00 PM PDT December 22nd , 2017.

Alternate system submission: Offerers submitting alternate items must provide technical information sufficient for a lay person to determine acceptability. Information will not be paid for by the government nor returned to the supplying party. The information will be used to determine product acceptability. Lack of sufficient information for our staff to determine product acceptability will result in a negative determination.  Any quote will then be found nonÂ­responsive to the solicitation and the quote will not be considered.

New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured, used/refurbished or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. No product in development shall be considered.

Authorized dealers: Experienced firms only who are authorized dealers will be considered in addition to the original equipment manufacturer. A letter from the manufacturer stating your company is an authorized dealer for the line items must be in possession by the due date and be available for submission, if requested.

FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)
  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price
and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:
  The Government will award to the lowest price, technically acceptable offeror. Brand name or equal. 
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Synopsis: 
COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Brand Name or Equal commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
Solicitation number 36C10G-18-Q-0118 is issued for this combined synopsis/solicitation; this solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-94 and 2005-95, both dated 19 Jan 2017.
Requirement Description:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is transforming the service it provides to Veterans through the MyVA effort.  MyVA was established in July 2015 to modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs  culture, processes, and capabilities to put the needs, expectations and interests of Veterans and their families first.  This effort is highly visible, with significant attention within the highest levels of government, the public, and the press. 
As this transformation progresses, VA's mission requirements to support America s Veterans are growing more quickly than its budget.  Key elements of VA s expanded mission requirements include:
15% expansion in the number of Veterans enrolled in VA Healthcare from FY 2009 through FY 2016
More than 100% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016  in the number of 100% disabled Veterans cared for by VA
6% increase in the number of medical appointments scheduled in FY 2016 vs FY 2014
More than 300% increase between FY 2009 and FY 2016 in the number of Veterans receiving education benefits through the VA
In order to ensure we are able to continue to provide Veterans with the benefits and care they have earned through their selfless service, VA is changing the way we do business.  Specifically, we are improving the management of our supply chain to aggregate demand and facilitate ease of ordering in the field.  Throughout VA, we are moving from local contracting to national contracting whenever feasible.  Simplified ordering processes will drive volume towards suppliers with national contracts.  Simultaneously, greater cost transparency throughout the VA will allow clinicians and VA leaders to select medical equipment that optimizes Veteran outcomes at the lowest cost.
For our suppliers, we anticipate that these changes will ease the process of doing business with the VA and drive down our suppliers  costs.  We welcome opportunities to work closely with suppliers to further reduce costs.  In return, we expect that suppliers will offer the VA value commensurate with VA s status as the largest integrated healthcare provider in the United States.  Specifically, VA expects that it will receive the most favorable prices, warranties, conditions, benefits, and terms for the same product as those given by the supplier to any provider in the country.  We expect that VA s large volumes will increasingly be directed toward those suppliers best able to offer value to the VA.  VA looks forward to collaborating with its suppliers to further drive down costs in order to deliver optimal value to our Veterans.
In light of this transformation, the VA has a requirement to purchase Radio Frequency Tissue Ablation Systems to deliver patient care at its VA Medical Centers throughout the United States, U.S. Territories, Guam and the Philippines.Â  Radiofrequency Tissue Ablation Systems are used for ablating dysfunctional tissue through an alternating current produced by a radiofrequency generator. Radiofrequency Tissue Ablation Systems are often used to destroy tumors or when performing surgery on the electrical conduction system of the heart.  
A single award Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract will be awarded for the purchase of Brand Name or Equal equipment in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications and schedule of this solicitation herein.  Quotes shall contain the terms for cost/price and technical capabilities of the Brand Name or Equal equipment.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.
All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112   Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing and the associated size standard are 1000 employees.  This procurement action is for full and open competition.  
This acquisition is for a single-award Firm-Fixed Price Requirements contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.5 for Cryotherapy Tissue Ablation Systems as identified in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule.  All interested companies shall provide a quote for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) listed in Attachment A, Cost/Price Schedule.  
The ordering period is one year with two 12 month option years.  Delivery is FOB destination.  Firm-Fixed Price Orders will be placed against this contract in writing and will provide the delivery locations, delivery dates and exact quantities. 
The FAR provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this acquisition including attached addenda to the provision.
The FAR provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, and the specific evaluation criteria as attached addenda also applies to this acquisition.  
The offeror is to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer.
Clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding any addenda to the clause.
Clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and a statement regarding which, if any, of the additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to the acquisition.

(2)

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>The purpose of this modification was to answer questions posted by vendors to contracting officer.
What was the value of the previous contract if any?Â  Since there is not currently a contract in place, what is the center currently paying for the services for that location?Â  I m assuming these questions are not off limits..Thanks.
There was not a previous contract in place, only an emergency which was put in place from 1 October 17 to 31 December 17.Â Â 
Can you please confirm the rated tonnages for the chillers and the cooling tower makeup rate in gallons for the last 12 months?Â  If you can provide the same for the cooling tower bleed please provide that as well.

We currently have 3 recip chillers one 400-ton, one 800-ton, and one 1,200-ton.Â  Two cooling towers with two cells each providing at total of 2,400-tons of capacity.

The VA does not have information indicating gallons of make-up nor bleed for the cooling towers.
Â 
Who owns the chemical feed equipment for the cooling towers and steam boilers, i.e. controllers, chemical feed pumps, solid chemistry feeders, etc.Â  If a new vendor is selected will the current vendorÂ be removing anything or is it all owned by the VA?

The VA owns the current chemical treatment equipment and will retain all said equipment.Â  The contractor awarded this contract shall replace the chemical treatment equipment.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<BR><BR>Insert the clause 1352.209â73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts.
As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507â2(c), insert the following clause:
Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010)
The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507â2(d), insert the following clause:
Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:
(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and
(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.
(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as âcontractorâ) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.
(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<BR><BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms âcontract,â âcontractor,â and âContracting Officerâ shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507â1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.
(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106â2â70, insert the following provision:

<DESC><p>Launched by President Obama in 2013, Power Africa works with African governments and private sector partners to remove barriers that impede sustainable energy development in sub-Saharan Africa and unlock the substantial wind, solar, hydropower, natural gas, biomass, and geothermal resources on the continent.<br /><br />A unique private sector led model, Power Africa draws on the combined expertise and abilities of more than 150 partners, including 12 U.S. Government agencies, the World Bank Group, the African Development Bank, United Nations' Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative, the Governments of Sweden, Norway, Canada, Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, African governments, and private sector partners. These partners collectively have committed over $50 billion to Power Africa's goals. Power Africa's "Toolbox" approach offers a range of resources and tools to advance key projects on the electricity grid, or beyond it. By leveraging U.S. expertise in energy technology and regulatory reform, combined with U.S. Government and private sector financial resources, Power Africa helps drive quick-impact interventions and policy reforms to push for sustainable energy development. Power Africa's goals are to increase electricity access by adding more than 30,000 megawatts of cleaner, more efficient electricity generation capacity and 60 million new home and business connections across sub-Saharan Africa by 2030. Power Africa also includes the Beyond the Grid sub-initiative, which works to expand rural electrification and access to small scale and off-grid technology.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent Federal agency which manages the U.S. Government's foreign assistance program, providing assistance for developing countries around the world in the areas of economic growth and trade, agriculture and the environment, education and training, democracy and governance, reconstruction and stabilization, global health, global partnerships and humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>Within USAID, the Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) oversees the solicitation, selection, award and administration of contracts, grants and cooperative agreements in support of the agency's development assistance objectives.  Procurement actions may involve the private or the public sectors, international organizations, non-government and private voluntary organizations, educational institutions, and host country organizations (both private and public sector). Because of the unique aspect of implementing procurement actions in an overseas context, USAID has implemented a supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), the AID Acquisition Regulations (AIDAR).  In the course of a year, total procurement actions (both acquisition and assistance) may exceed $11 billion.</p>
<p>The Washington headquarters Office of Acquisition and Assistance deals with both domestic and non-domestic (foreign and international) procurement actions, requiring the ability to recognize and understand a broad spectrum of very different cultures, and to accommodate contractual requirements to very different implementing environments, reconciling Federal procurement policies and procedures with host country policies and procedures, usually in highly visible and complex countries, and often involving coordination among numerous donor countries and organizations.</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The incumbent serves as a Contract Specialist working on actions for the Office of Transition Initiatives, Bureau of Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA/OTI), working in the in the Management Bureau, Office of Acquisition Assistance (M/OAA). The employee is responsible for functions involving highly complex negotiated procurements of significant importance to the Agency. Requirements of the contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, inter-agency agreements are typically highly specialized and involve complex systems or sensitive international programs.</p>
<p>The Contract Specialist is expected to demonstrate significant knowledge of the basic principles of procurement, an ability to conduct research and analysis of a broad spectrum of assistance activities, and an ability to communicate well with a wide variety of potential and actual bidders in the procurement process.  This is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations.  For M/OAA to support DCHA/OTI in implementing its rapid response strategy, it is essential that DCHA prompt procurement support is provided.  The incumbent must have a strong sense of responsibility, a high customer service standard, be highly organized, pay close attention to detail, and be able to complete tasks with minimal guidance.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Knowledge Aided GEOINT Latency Reduction (KAGLR)</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA FA8750-17-S-7004</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory is soliciting white papers under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for research, development, integration, test and evaluation of technologies/techniques to provide geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) in all its forms and from whatever source - imagery, imagery intelligence, or geospatial data and information - to ensure a solid foundation of knowledge for planning, decision, and action while creating tailored, customer-specific geospatial intelligence, analytic services, and solutions.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community (IC) intend to meet future customer intelligence needs through anticipatory analysis that is both robust and holistic. GEOINT encompasses all aspects of imagery and includes, but is not limited to, data ranging from the ultraviolet through the microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as information derived from the analysis of literal imagery; geospatial data; georeferenced social media; and information technically derived from the processing, exploitation, literal, and non-literal analysis of spectral, spatial, temporal, radiometric, phase history, polarimetric data, fused products, and the ancillary data needed for data processing and exploitation, and signature information (to include development, validation, simulation, data archival, and dissemination). Improving analytic workflows and capabilities, the DoD &amp; IC stakeholders will require the development of new analytic techniques, an environment that can quickly leverage new technologies, and integration of advanced geospatial sensor data to enable more sophisticated analytic products and services. The intent is to take advantage of the full-spectrum of geospatial phenomenologies while leveraging both traditional and non-traditional sources. To take advantage of these emerging capabilities, the GEOINT community needs to evolve analytical tradecraft. Potential solutions must adhere to applicable DoD &amp; IC security &amp; Cyber-related and information assurance directives while addressing enterprise-wide stakeholder requirements specific to GEOINT timeliness, quality, &amp; latency metrics. Executing pioneering collection strategies and developing innovative, full-spectrum capable technologies and services will enable the delivery of cost-efficient, flexible solutions that effectively mitigate intelligence gaps and greatly reduce or eliminate today's latency challenges. The KAGLR BAA seeks significant advances to the DoD-IC, and other government agency's GEOINT-related missions across the following sub-disciplines:</p>
<p>&bull; Full-Spectrum GEOINT (FSG) - FSG is derived from multiple sources and correlated to provide actionable intelligence for mission level decisions. Knowledge-based processing and ontological reasoning are required to correlate FSG sources while assessing risks to operational missions. FSG sources include the following:<br />&bull; Synthetic Aperture Radar<br />&bull; Bi-static Radar processing &amp; extraction<br />&bull; Thermal Infrared<br />&bull; Multi- and Hyper-Spectral<br />&bull; Video<br />&bull; Overhead Persistent Infrared techniques<br />&bull; Modality Independent Point Clouds<br /><br />&bull; GEOINT-derived information correlation - Machine Learning (ML) techniques that reduce latency and improve false alarm rates associated with the GEOINT-derived information correlation, data access, and visualization. <br /><br />&bull; Multi-peak data production &amp; extraction - Machine Learning (ML) techniques that reduce the latency associated with the generation &amp; co-registration of multi-peak GEOINT data products; ML techniques for autonomous data extraction from multipeak GEOINT data sets; ML techniques to identify and cull redundant data from multiple datasets.<br />&nbsp;<br />Specific technologies of interest that support and/or complement the sub disciplines referenced include the following: Convolution Neural Networks / Neural Networks to support data tagging; auto-categorization to reduce manual analyst-driven tasks; Bayesian network implementations that improve analytic confidence and reduce critical reporting/response timelines; Cloud-based graphic processing unit (GPU) implementations that increase speed and efficiency of automated extraction techniques; and Cloud-based High Performance Computing (HPC) &amp; Artificial Intelligence (AI) acceleration technologies to improve the speed and accuracy of image recognition applications &amp; techniques.<br /><br />In the development of solutions, consideration must be given to cyber-security and information assurance. Information Systems need to be developed with security and security interfaces so that the application of various security practices are transparent to the user, ensuring efficient system use with a high level of security. Additionally, with the Intelligence Community's transition to the Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE), additional consideration must be given to Assured Cloud Computing. Security risks related to the technologies, software and systems under development and the eventual deployment environment should be considered. As a cloud environment relies heavily on distributed assets, it is necessary to develop approaches to fulfill the 3 pillars of the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability). Investigate assured computing architectures and associated technologies that will address the mission shortfalls of the DoD and non-DoD information communities.<br /><br />The KAGLR BAA technologies supporting the sub-disciplines above may require the planning and conducting of field tests to demonstrate the advancement in the specific technology. This includes preparing test plans; acquiring, transporting, deploying, and operating all equipment; operating and measuring ground truth sources; evaluating and monitoring test execution; and documenting all test results.<br /><br />The innovative technologies, applications and techniques being pursued under the KAGLR BAA will address significant shortfalls in GEOINT production, reporting, and dissemination choke points which span the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community. Candidate technologies will be evaluated against current requirements for latency, quality, quantity/throughput, and scalability/affordability and will be nominated for transition where appropriate.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. FUNDING: Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:</p>
<p><strong>FY17 - $18.0M<br />FY18 - $14.0M<br />FY19 - $ 9.0M<br />FY20 - $ 6.9M<br />FY21 - $ 2.0M</strong></p>
<p>Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts normally ranging from $500K to $3M. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received, subject to the availability of funds. All potential Offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>
<p>2. FORM: Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.</p>

Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by 2 CFR part 200.458, Pre-Award Costs.</p>
<p>e. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM: An offeror must have a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">government approved</span></strong> accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IMPORTANT</span>:</strong> If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_<br />cview=1</a></p>
<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">descending order of importance</span> and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>a. <strong>Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates the detailed approach, development, and testing of the proposed new technology to achieve relevant new capabilities or enhancements <br />b. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge <br />c. Openness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution -The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology, and <br />d. Reasonableness and Realism of Proposed Costs and Fees (if any) </strong></p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: As required by 2 CFR 200 of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, the Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and FAR 9.104-6.</p>
<p><strong>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the TPOC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_<br />cview=1</a>. Always reference the newest versions of these documents.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Confidential, SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.</p>
<p>This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dla.mil/HQ/InformationOperations/LogisticsInformationServices.aspx">http://www.dla.mil/HQ/InformationOperations/LogisticsInformationServices.aspx</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-2255 (24/7).

<p>3. DATA RIGHTS:</p>
<p>a. SBIR RIGHTS. The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. <br />b. NON-SBIR RIGHTS. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: <br />a. Contract Applicable: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports. <br />b. FAPIIS Applicable: As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, non-federal entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide. This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.</p>
<p>5. NOTICE: The following provisions* apply:<br />(a) FAR 52.209-11, Representation by Corporations Regarding Delinquent Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction under any Federal Law <br />(b) DFARS 252.239-7017, Notice of Supply Chain Risk <br />(c) DFARS 252.204-7008, Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense Information Controls <br />* Please note that the current versions or deviations of the related clauses will be included in any resulting contract.</p>
<p>6. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GRANT AWARDS ONLY</span></strong>: For efforts proposed as grant awards, offerors must provide an abstract in their proposal (not to exceed one page) that is publically releasable and that describes - in terms the public may understand - the project or program supported by the grant. If the proposal is selected for award, the DoD will publically post the abstract to comply with Section 8123 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235).</p>

<DESC>Market Survey - U.S. 81mm Weaponized Universal Lightweight Fire Control (WULF) W15QKN-18-X- 00MT
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting command (ACC) - New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, 07806&#8208;5000, on behalf of the Office of the Product Manager Precision Fires and Mortars (PdM PFM), Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (PM CAS) is seeking potential sources capable of producing Weaponized Universal Lightweight Fire Control (WULF) for use in all U.S. 81mm Mortar systems. The WULF shall provide real time digital display of weapon azimuth and elevation in all weather conditions without exposing the user to a hazardous environment. The WULF will be used in place of the current M67 mortar sight. The purpose of this market survey is to obtain current information from potential sources on a pointing technology that has been developed and tested to at least a Technology Readiness Level (TRL 5) per the DoD Technology Readiness Assessment Guidance. The basic technological components must be integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so it can be tested in a relevant environment. The technology must be able to be matured or developed to a level TRL 6 at which the system can be tested in the proposed environment within 12 months or sooner. The proposed prototype shall be demonstrated/delivered in Calendar Year (CY) 18.</p>
<p>The potential solution shall have the required maturity level to enter into Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (E&amp;MD) and be qualified to support production start by CY21. The government estimates a total of 800 WULF systems will be procured and fielded to 81mm Mortar Units between FY22&#8208;FY25.<br />The production quantity may be significantly increased if the WULF can work on 60mm and 120mm mortar systems.</p>
<p>1) Overview/Purpose/Description of Procurement.<br />The WULF must satisfy all of the requirements specified in the System Requirements Document (SRD), (available upon request). The WULF shall provide a pointing capability that supplies weapon azimuth in reference to grid north, elevation, and roll values for all US Army 81mm Mortar variants (M252 and M252A1). The purpose of the WULF is to replace the current M67 sight, reduce weapon emplacement time, and improve accuracy when engaging targets. The WULF shall be ruggedized for continuous<br />operation in a wide range of military and combat environments.</p>
<p>2) Scope of Effort<br />Interested parties will be required to submit a detailed proposed solution that can meet all of the requirements specified in the SRD. If the proposed technology demonstrates a sufficient solution, the government may have interest in partnering to further develop the technology to meet the requirements in the SRD.

<SUBJECT>DRAFT: Spectrum Efficient National Surveillance Radar (SENSR) Program - Approach Announcement
<SOLNBR>25214
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>123117
<ARCHDATE>12312017
<CONTACT>Jaya Rangan, jaya.rangan@faa.gov, Phone: 202-267-0758

<a href="mailto:jaya.rangan@faa.gov">Click here to email Jaya Rangan</a>
<DESC>The SENSR announcement is amended to include the following SENSR Approach, details of which are as follows:

SENSR Requirements

The Government is currently redefining the surveillance performance sought by SENSR, moving from traditional radar specification oriented characteristics, such as beamwidth and sidelobes, to more performance-based coverage volume requirements.  The Government believes this approach will allow industry to consider and propose all available alternatives to meeting the performance requirements without the perceived or real limitations that traditional radar specification oriented characteristics might unintentionally impose on industry.  Coverage volume requirements such as âCoastline,â âCritical Infrastructure,â and âTerminal Air Traffic Control,â will provide the specific capabilities required for a given location anywhere within these designated coverage volumes.  

Classified 

The Government continues to work toward defining classified SENSR performance requirements. 

In particular, DoD, as part of its Homeland Air Defense mission and in consideration of the SENSR program scope, is working to finalize DoD-specific elements of the SENSR CONOPS and complete the DoD classified annex to the SENSR program requirements document.  

The Government anticipates a two-step approach to providing the classified requirements in order to allow near-term dialog with the industry while the Government continues to refine these requirements.  The Government intends to have updated requirements in early spring 2018 ready for dialog with industry prior to a second RFI issuance targeted for May 2018, followed by a SIR in 2019.  The missions and functions contained in the classified requirements will be specified in conjunction with the second RFI release, followed by the specific classified performance values and parameters, before a draft of the final SIR is released.  

High Resolution Weather

The Government SENSR cross-agency team has completed assessment of industry input with respect to the challenges of meeting SENSR requirements, specifically the high resolution weather requirements using Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology as defined in the Request for Information (RFI).  When considering the SENSR Pipeline Plan schedule and the planned 2024 auction of the targeted spectrum, industry was quite clear and unanimous that attempting to meet the high resolution weather requirements using AESA technical solutions deployable in the near term poses substantial risk to the SENSR program schedule.  Industry input confirms that additional evaluation is needed to determine the most prudent strategy to sustain the high resolution weather capability currently provided by legacy NEXRAD WSR-88D and Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) systems, and how this capability could fit within the SENSR Pipeline plan and program strategy.
   
Based on this information, the Government is evaluating its approach to ensure proper inclusion of the weather requirements to reduce risk to the SENSR Pipeline Plan schedule.  In addition to high resolution weather, for any program requirements that pose a SENSR Pipeline Plan schedule risk, the program is considering incentivizing the design of solutions that maximize the opportunity for fulfilling requirements into the future â i.e., developing system(s) that can flexibly evolve, or capabilities that can be delivered in future phases. The Government will be seeking additional information from industry as part of its next RFI release in 2018.

Phase II Scope 

Based on industry responses to the initial RFI, the Governmentâs assumptions on costs associated with Phase II were not in line with industryâs assumptions and corresponding estimates.  The Government is continuing to refine the scope of Phase II activities.  The Government does not intend to require a Critical Design Review level of any system or subsystem during Phase II, nor conduct extensive âfly-offâ demonstrations where key performance parameters are validated.  Demonstration of technical solutions and design assessments to substantiate the maturity of proposed technical systems is likely to remain within the scope of Phase II.    The Government continues to assess various options for Phase II in order to define an approach that will maximize the return on Government and Industryâs cost and schedule investments in support of the SENSR Pipeline Plan.  The Governmentâs Phase II approach will be more definitized within the draft SIR when released for industry review and comment.

Draft SIR Release Schedule

The schedule for the draft Down-Select SIR release was previously targeted for fall of 2017.  Given the results from the RFI and the associated acquisition adjustments, including the Governmentâs intent to release a second RFI in 2018, the Government believes the draft SIR target for release will likely move to 2019.  The government is currently considering the relative merits of using a down-select SIR versus a fully-open solution implementation SIR (i.e., contract award without a down-select). Both acquisition strategies assume SENSR will successfully navigate the funding gap between the award of the future solution implementation contract and the receipt of proceeds from the future auction.

<CONTACT>Brooks, Bari R.
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Enterprise Assessments (EA) intends to issue a contract modification on a sole source basis under DE-HS0000100 with Chenega Support Services LLC (Chenega) for a full range of services for EAâs National Training Center (NTC). National Training Center performs the mission-critical support function of developing, maintaining, and delivering standardized health, safety, safeguards, security, and protective force training for DOE and National Nuclear Security Administrationâs Federal and contractor employees. This support includes developing, providing and supporting safety and security classroom and on-line training at the NTC and other locations, managing training programs, providing cyber-security and information technology support for the NTC as well as at DOE Headquarters in Washington, D.C., and maintaining the facilities and grounds. The modification extends the period of performance for five months, with a base period of two (2) months and three one (1) month option periods.

In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253 [c] [1], as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements. Chenega is the only source able to provide the minimum needs required to fulfill the services to support NTCâs ongoing initiatives until the competition for the new NTC contract is complete. Chenega has highly specialized skills and a depth of background knowledge that supports the NTC mission; it would not be possible to obtain the highly specialized services at the level of quality required for a short-term period pending the award of the new contract. 

THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

Interested parties may submit a capability statement by January 2, 2018, at 2:30 pm local prevailing time (Washington, D.C.) via e-mail to Bari.Brooks@hq.doe.gov. The written response must include a detailed discussion demonstrating experience providing services identified in this announcement and past performance client information for similar work.  

A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC>Amendment 0001: Closing Date now included in posting.

Introduction

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL seeks potential sources with the ability to provide Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) Integrated Training Systems and continued life-cycle support of established LVC systems under NAWCTSDâs cognizance. LVC systems provide virtual maintenance and operational training of U.S. Navy systems to U.S. Navy watch standers. The development of new training systems and upgrades to existing training systems will include training for individual, team, and/or multi-team training requirements.

Responses received for this notice will serve as a consideration for the governmentâs decision to fulfill this requirement under a set-aside, full and open competition, or sole source acquisition.
 Additionally, the requested information will be taken into account for acquisition planning purposes.

It is anticipated that any contract action associated with this notice will result in a single award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and/or Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) basis, with either a five (5) year base ordering period or a five (5) year base ordering period and two (2) one (1) year option periods. The estimated contract ceiling is approximately $49.9M. 

Background

LVC systems were previously known as Live, Virtual, and Constructive Modeling and Simulation (LVCMS) systems. The LVC training systems and devices provide a wide range of training capabilities to various Department of Defense (DoD) communities.
 LVC training devices are located in various school houses and fleet concentration centers throughout the world. Some of the LVC training systems are used as training gap fillers until suitable devices can be delivered in the future. Other LVC training systems are designed to support integrated and coordinated Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Virtual At-Sea Training (VAST) tactical training, Anti-Access Area-Denial (A2AD) and Cyber Warfare using Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) Navy Training Baseline (NTB) simulation. Some current training system configurations are comprised of personal computers (PC) with each PC system representing a mission training station in a particular aircraft (i.e. SH-60B, SH-60F, P-3C ), shipboard system or combat systems, when in a networked environment, allow for integrated mission training.
 These LVC systems primarily use Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware and various commercial software products and operating systems to emulate, simulate, and/or stimulate various training systems for training purposes. Commercial item PC technology changes rapidly and it is not unusual for systems to become unsupportable over a period of time. When this happens, the government will have to replace the existing LVC training systems comprised of PC hardware with the latest PC technology and latest software in order to be compliant with the Department of Defense (DoD) Information Technology (DoDI 8510.01) Risk Management Framework. Additionally, NAWCTSD has a requirement to provide continued life cycle support of established LVC training systems under NAWCTSDâs cognizance.
 

Requirements

The contractor shall provide design, development, integration, test, delivery, and sustainment support for the LVC training systems and ASW VAST family of training systems, to include installation support at various locations. The contractor shall design the training systems for compatibility with anticipated changes in products such as operating systems and JSAF NTB. The contractor shall also design and develop operable training systems within the Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) using JSAF NTB. The contractor shall research, design, test, evaluate, integrate, implement and support transition of training solutions. In addition, the contractor shall provide upgrades to include software patches to the existing trainers plus develop and field new training solutions emulating other military systems.
 The government laboratory for testing and integration of software and hardware is located in Orlando, Florida. The contractor shall provide the sustainment and Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) support of LVC training systems at multiple sites including multiple OCONUS DoD sites.

These efforts shall require support to and coordination with various working groups and participation in the System Engineering Technical Review (SETR) process. The contractor shall support the submission of its technologies to the SETR process and its build-test-build approach to technology maturation. In addition, the contractor shall conduct design, development, testing, analysis and documentation under the guidance of the various working groups.
 The contractor shall support integration, test, and delivery. The contractor shall update its product to address the findings of the working groups. 

The government shall retain government purpose rights to all source code and data pertaining to the design, component specifications, hardware, software, processes and procedures developed under this contract.

This announcement is set-aside for firms classified as "Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business" under NAICS code 541330 Engineering Services. The magnitude of construction for the above referenced project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  The estimated duration of design is 210 Days from the issuance of the Notice to Proceed. The contract shall remain active through Construction Period Services.

This is not a Request for Proposal and an award will not be made with this announcement.  This announcement is a request for SF 330s from qualified firms that meet the professional and set aside requirements listed in this announcement. The proposed services will be obtained by a negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract

Contract Award Procedure:  Before a small business is proposed as a potential contractor, they shall be certified by VETbiz and registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) via internet site at http://www.sam.gov. Failure of a proposed SDVOSB to be certified by the CVE at the time the SF 330 is submitted will result in their elimination from further consideration for award. The government will evaluate the SF330s received and a minimum of the three most highly qualified firms shall be called back for interviews.  After interviews, the most highly qualified firm will be requested to submit a proposal. The SF330 must address identified capabilities that are summarized in 1) through 8).  The Professional Qualification and Specialized Experience/ Technical Competence factors are slightly more important than the other six factors which are listed in descending order of importance.   1) Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services:  This is intended to evaluate the personal experience of firm members who work in the firm's project office and are scheduled to be assigned to the design team.  The key positions should include Project Managers, Quality Assurance Managers, Architectural Design, Civil Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Structural Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Fire Protection Engineers, and Environmental Engineers.  Firms may submit any other personnel they feel are significant for the types of work described in Specialized Experience. 2) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence in the type of work required: This factor evaluates the experience of the firm and design team in completing projects requiring skills similar to those anticipated for this contract. The project will be to provide a full set of construction documents for a project that will install an electric substation adjacent to the existing substation located on the LVAMC campus.  Major elements of work included, but not limited to:

  Coordinate with Met-Ed Electric to determine current electric consumption and trends.
  Determine capacity requirements needed for new substation to ensure current and future demands will be satisfied
  Design a new electric substation
Extra consideration may be given for experience designing projects for Department of Veterans Affairs Facilities. 3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies (Particularly Department of Veterans Affairs) and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. 
Note:  Project Past Performance information for projects performed shall be evaluated as either Relevant or Not Relevant.  Not Relevant projects shall not be evaluated. 4) Capacity to accomplish the work:  this factor evaluates the ability of the A-E firm to, given their current projected workload and the availability of their key personnel, to accomplish the project in the required time. 5)  Location:  This factor evaluates the distance from the A-E firms design office from the location of work (Lebanon VA Medical Center).

<DESC>This project is a design/build repair of the elevated water storage tanks at Facility Numbers 1464 and 8790, Marine Corps Logistics Base (MCLB), Albany, GA.  The contractor shall provide all design, engineering, labor, management, supervision, tools, supplies, incidental work, materials, and transportation necessary to perform these repairs as outlined below.  MCLB has two elevated water storage tanks with nominal capacity of 500,000 gallons each. Deficiencies
were identified during an inspection and need to be corrected to bring the tanks in compliance with AWWA M42, Steel Water Storage Tanks, and the applicable UFCs. An additional structural inspection was conducted after an EF3 tornado on January 22.
 2017.  Specific deficiencies include cleaning and applying a top coat to the tank exterior, re-application of the Marine Corps Logo, adding fall protection to the interior ladder, repairing the exterior hatches and dome vents, and structural tornado damage, installing impressed current cathodic protection for internal corrosion protection, installing tank level controls with remote reporting, and providing exterior security fencing for the tank sites.

Nature:        New Requirement     Follow-on Order

Description of Supplies or Services:
The estimated value of the proposed action is $ 
The contractor shall provide repair and preventive maintenance services to support the GE OEC C-Arms and GE Senographe mammography units used in the OR and Radiology departments at the VA Central Iowa Health Care System (VACIHCS) in Des Moines, IA. The C-Arm and Mammography units are used by physicians to obtain real-time images for patient care and diagnoses in support of the VA Mission and facility objectives. The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations and VA Acquisition Regulations. 

Equipment Description
System ID
GE CR Senographe Essential FFDM
515699VAES
GE XR OEC Series 9900 Elite

5. IDENTIFY THE AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), (B), and (C) or 8.405-6(b)), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  

 An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

 Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; GE Healthcare Field Service Engineers (FSE) are factory trained and are the most familiar with the system to troubleshoot, order correct parts, replace parts, and have access to proprietary software. OEM parts must be used on this vital equipment. No other contractors are able to provide the services required by VA due to proprietary equipment and software keys.

 In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 

 Items peculiar to one manufacturer: 

 A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.) 

 These are  direct replacements  parts/components for existing equipment.  

 The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.

6. DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(d) TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
NAC has Determined the price to be fair and reasonable IAW FAR 8.404(d)

7. DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Vetbiz.gov has been check with no SDVOSB or VOSB Vendors able to perform the services needed.  Searched SBA with no possible vendors as well. No vendors other than GE Healthcare were found to have the proprietary software and knowledge to safely service the GE CR Senographe Essential FFDM and the 2 GE XR OEC Series 9900 Elites, or have been certified by GE to service the machines.
8. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
This equipment is highly sensitive and specialized and any malfunction can cause patient misdiagnoses causing improper treatment or no treatment. The manufacturer holds parts and service information as proprietary, and there are no third-party service providers available to provide full preventive maintenance and emergency repair coverage. The use of reverse engineering or refurbished parts is unacceptable and places patients at risk. Only Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts may be used. If service were to be performed by a third party, the Government will assume all liability for incidents and accidents related to equipment malfunctions.

<p>Due to unanticipated acquisition process delays, it has become necessary to modify existing contract SP3300-13-C-5001 to allow for uninterrupted Warehousing and Distribution Services through 31 July 2018. Pursuant to the exception under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), only Olgoonik Technical Services, LLC is capable of providing the services at this time; award to any other source will result in unacceptable delays and cause a disruption to DLA Distribution Richmond, VA activities.

The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.</p>

<DESC>ICE ERO has a requirement for firing range services within a 10 mile radius of the ICE/ERO Field Office located at 555 N Woodlawn ST, BLDG 4, Suite 160, Wichita, KS 67208. The shooting range facility shall accommodate at least 23 ICE officers per quarter. The facility shall provide a course that can be used for pistol shooting, rifle shooting and shotgun shooting. The facility shall provide delineated distances of 1.5 yard, 3 yards, 7 yards, 15 yards and 25 yards for pistol shooting. The facility shall provide electronic turning targets which can be centrally controlled by the Firearms Instructor.
<p>The ICE/ERO Chicago Field Office conducted market research to identify local firing ranges for ICE officers to conduct quarterly pistol, shotgun and rifle qualifications. The market research conducted by ICE Chicago Field Office concluded that the privately owned gun range known as Range 54 in Wichita, KS is the only range in the area can meet all of these requirements.</p>
