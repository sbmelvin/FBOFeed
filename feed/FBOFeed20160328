This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<p style="TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">(X)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award sole source contracts to state agencies to conduct inspections of animal producers and associated firms to investigate drug residues in animal tissues and to determine compliance with 21 CFR589.2000, "BSE RULE". This program meets the criteria set forth in 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statue. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301), requires the services from state organizations possessing the authority necessary to conduct regulatory inspections. The period of performance of this requirement allows for a base year and one (1) option year. Contractors must meet the following special requirements: (1) possess legal authority under state law necessary to gain access to any regulated private commercial establishment for the unique purpose of conducting regulatory inspections and investigations to determine compliance with the animal drug and feed provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act at any geographical location within the state; (2) have trained personnel experienced with the inspectional procedures and evidence development techniques necessary to assess the conformance of an establishment with the federal law and regulations or comparable state requirements; and (3) demonstrate experience with state regulatory or voluntary procedures for corrective violative practices. Only governmental organizations have the unique qualifications and authority to perform this kind of activity. This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with state organizations under the authority of FAR 6.302-5. This notice is issued for informational purposes and not a request for competitive proposals. Any interested party should submit a statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine the requirements of this synopsis can be met, no later than 15 days from the date of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contracts based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The solicitation will be available on or about March 28, 2016 on the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The proposals are due April 28, 2016. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and amendments. Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request. Responses to this notice must be sent to lisa.oneill@fda.hhs.gov.
<p>No phone calls will be accepted.</p>

Based on the results of the Sources Sought notice posted in regards to N39430-15-R-1609, combined with additional market research, a determination was made to not set aside this procurement for small business. This determination was made partially due to the rationale that, based on the responses received, the Government would not be able to achieve the minimum requirements of being able to hold discussions with at least three of the most highly qualified firms regarding concepts and the relative utility of alternative methods of furnishing the required services as required in FAR 36.602-3(c).
 The activity small business office concurred with the decision.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has a requirement to provide an assessment of the Civil Rights Division's (CRT) model of police reform and effectiveness of its consent decrees. Since August 2015, CRT has worked with Arizona State University (ASU) to design and plan the project, including: coordinating sites selections, assessing data transfer options, and determining the evaluation approach and methodologies to be utilized. DOJ intends to negotiate with and award a contract to ASU to have them assess whether the outcome metrics CRT currently uses to assess the success of their consent decrees are appropriate or whether there are additional outcome metrics they should incorporate into their consent decrees and evaluate whether CRT's current reform model is accomplishing its intended goal of eliminating patterns of unlawful law enforcement conduct and promoting constitutional policing, to the extent that their effects can be measured to date. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, there is only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy the agency requirements. Interested persons must submit their interest and capability to the Contracting Officer identified below no later than 2:00 pm eastern time on April 4, 2016. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and does not constitute a solicitation. However, all statements of interest and capability received by the due date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement

In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs."</p>
<p>The 354th Contracting Squadron is seeking qualification packages and past performance information from vendors interested in providing professional architect and engineering services at Eielson AFB, AK to mitigate geotechnical failures at a facility on Eielson AFB, Alaska. The facility is currently sliding down the hillside on which it sits and experiencing progressive structural damage in the process.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Since its construction in 1997, the Conventional Munitions Shop (Bldg 6385) has experienced differential settlement. This differential settlement has caused progressive cracking in the walls of the facility. A geotechnical study was conducted in 2011 that indicated differential settlement was occurring at Bldg 6385. At the time of the study, some of the cracks in the exterior CMU wall were thought to be a result of thermal expansion and contraction; however, in the time since that study, diagonal cracks have started from the corners of multiple openings (doors and windows) in various walls throughout the facility. These diagonal cracks originating from these openings are good indicators that differential settlement is still occurring at the site and causing damage to the building's walls. In addition to the damage to Bldg 6385, the large concrete pad at this location has also been damaged as a result of this geotechnical issue. The slab has been moving down the hill in the northwesterly direction. A project was recently done (summer 2014) to repair the slab. A project was recently done at Bldg 6385 (summer of 2015) in which French drains were inserted into the ground in the vicinity of Bldg 6385 in an attempt to provide better drainage of the soil in that area and mitigate the poor geotechnical properties that currently exist. Although there are no known contaminants around the site of Bldg 6385, the soil contamination tests outlined in the Generic Sample Analysis Plan (SAP) will be conducted during the site investigation. These tests are outlined in the Generic SAP document that was prepared by Eielson AFB in 2013 and can be found in the environmental section at Eielson AFB. The possibility of finding soil contaminants during those tests always exists. In the case that contaminants are found, the contaminated soil would need to be dealt with in an appropriate fashion.</p>
<p>This is a competitive selection process in which competing offeror's qualifications will be evaluated in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 36.6 to determine the most highly qualified firms. The Government intends to award one Firm Fixed-Price contract.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 36.603(b): To be considered for architect-engineer contracts, a firm must file with the appropriate office or board the Standard Form 330, "Architect-Engineer Qualifications," Part II and when applicable, SF 330, Part I.

<p>This acquisition will be a 100% Small Business set-aside. The NAICS 541330 (Engineering Services) applies to this acquisition, with a small business size standard of $15M. The Disclosure of Magnitude for the subsequent construction project is between $250,000 and $500,000 IAW FAR 36.204(d).</p>
<p>The work to be performed shall include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>1. Attend a pre-investigation meeting.<br />2. Site investigation, investigation of options, development of design concepts, and production of an investigation report, including a discussion of options with recommendations and cost estimates.<br />3. Development of the design documents for the selected option - including design analysis, specifications, drawings and cost estimates.<br />4. Attendance at the various project related meetings and review conferences.<br />5. Responding to review comments and making revisions to the design as agreed upon during the reviews.<br />6. Producing and submitting the final project design documents.</p>
<p>A-E EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS: A-E's experience shall include that which is commensurate with the requirements specific to the scope of design.</p>
<p>A. The A-E shall demonstrate that they have experienced personnel with Alaska Registrations, and adequate capacity and depth in the following disciplines:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Perform repairs of worn areas of Lowell Creek Tunnel which is an approximately 2,100 feet long tunnel through Bear Mountain on the southwest side of Seward, Alaska. The tunnel is a 10 feet high, horseshoe shaped tunnel which diverts Lowell Creek away from Seward, through Bear Mountain into Resurrection Bay. The tunnel is lined with concrete throughout. The floor and some of the side wall is armored with a combination of 40 pound and 70 pound railroad rails welded to channel crossties embedded in concrete. Water flow and debris have damaged the tunnel intake transition, tunnel entrance, tunnel sidewall and invert lining. Base contract work will occur within the top 400 feet of the tunnel and will include the following: remove loose concrete between the rails at the intake transition and replace with high strength silica fume concrete; remove loose concrete at exposed rebar at the tunnel entrance walls and roof and replace with high strength silica fume concrete and reestablish missing portions of reinforcement mat of #6 deformed bars; fill a large gouge in the tunnel side wall and adjacent floor and extend steel rail wall armoring by approximately 30 feet; and repair tunnel invert by securing loose rails, removing loose concrete and re-lining the invert with high strength silica fume concrete. Optional work will include re-lining the remainder of the tunnel invert with high strength silica fume concrete. Work will require diversion of Lowell Creek during repairs and will likely occur in the winter (no earlier than Winter 2016/2017) when stream flow is lowest.</p>
<p>The estimated award date is June 15, 2016. The period of performance is between June 15, 2016 and May 15, 2017.</p>
<p>The Estimated Magnitude of Construction is $1,000,000 - $5,000,000. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, which has a size standard of $36.5 million for a potential acquisition.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:
<p>This will be a firm fixed-price construction contract located at McNaray Lock &amp; Dam in Benton County, Washington and Umatilla County, OR. Estimated construction magnitude is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. Payment bond or irrevocable letter of credit will be required.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF WORK:</p>
<p>This project is to construct permanent closure of two fish ladder entrances near the spillway. One entrance is on the Washington Shore Ladder and one on the Oregon Shore ladder. Openings are approximately 15 feet wide and up to 48 feet high.</p>
<p>Existing stoplogs will be removed from the entrances. Oregon Shore Stoplogs are to be salvaged and turned over to the Project. Washington Shore Stoplogs are to be removed for Contractor disposal. Washington Shore Fish ladder stoplogs have tested positive for toxic metals based paint coatings. No toxic metals based paints are anticipated on the existing Oregon Shore stoplogs.</p>
<p>New steel Hollow Structural Shapes (HSS) structures will be built and lowered into the entrance slots. The HSS require structural channels to be installed onsite during installation. Expanding openings in the concrete may be required to install the HSS. Concrete will be placed around HSS structures to permanently close fish ladder openings. Contractor designed, fabricated and placed caissons will be installed to isolate work from the tailrace water during construction of closures. Isolation may be required on the fish ladder side of the entrances. Divers will be required. AWS D1.1 certified welder(s) will be required. Floating plants may be needed to place concrete on the Washington Shore entrance closure. There is very limited vehicle access to the Washington Shore tailrace deck (30 Ton rough terrain crane or smaller).</p>
<p>Construction timeframe will run from (approximately) 1 November 2016 through 28 February 2017. All work must be completed with fish ladders ready for operation by 28 February 2017. Much of the work will take place during an extended Navigation Lock outage along the Columbia and Snake Rivers (12 December 2016 through 20 March 2017).</p>
<p>All on-site work shall be performed in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1).</p>

 Synopsis:

      The Department of Veterans Affairs has need for a general construction contractor to provide all labor, materials, and equipment as necessary to expand a new parking structure on the north side of the Washington, DC Medical Center, Main campus located in lot 2A. The existing structure levels B2, B1, and Ground provides approximately 327 parking spaces.  This building is adjacent to the Emergency Department and Primary Care entrances at the Washington, DC VA Medical Center.

The construction of additional levels on top of the existing parking structure continues the process of aligning parking on campus for patient and visitors and closing the parking gap. The existing structure levels B2, B1, and Ground provides approximately 327 parking spaces. Additional levels (2nd, 3rd, 4th ) on top of the existing (B2, B1, Ground) parking structure will further consolidates surface parking to the existing structure and as a result will limit the level of overall traffic circulating deeper within the medical center campus. The Expand Visitor/ Patient Parking Garage Phase 1 project vertical expansion will be constructed on top of the existing, recently completed (2013), standalone precast parking garage.

The Expand Visitor/ Patient Parking Garage Phase 1 project vertical expansion shall add approximately 310 parking spaces including the appropriate number of additional accessible spaces required by the latest VA guidelines.

The construction of the Expand Visitor/ Patient Parking Garage Phase 1 project will require the Contractor to take all necessary precautions when making connections to the current/existing parking garage structure and systems to protect and provide a seamless transition.

<ARCHDATE>07282016
<CONTACT>David A. Greaves, Phone 4438614648, Email david.a.greaves4.civ@mail.mil - Oladayo Kaka, Phone 4438614636, Email oladayo.a.kaka.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />Modular Open Radio Frequency Architecture (MORA)
<p><br />1.0 Description<br />1.1 The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Intelligence Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is seeking information on how an interested contractor could implement a converged Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Electronic Warfare (EW) architecture which maximizes the use of open architectures and standards, reduces size weight and power (SWaP), and facilitates the use of common radio frequency (RF) component types across communications and EW technologies on Army platforms. <br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Final Solicitation or a promise to issue a Final Solicitation in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future Final Solicitation, if issued. If a Final Solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor the FedBizOpps website (HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV) for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background<br />The U.S. Army CERDEC established the Hardware/Software Convergence Working-Level Integrated Product Team (HW/SW-WIPT) to develop and execute a detailed plan to achieve a modular and open family of hardware and software components for implementing interoperable C4ISR/EW capabilities on Army platforms.<br />The plan defined by the HW/SW-WIPT matures the following standard specifications by developing reference implementations and conducting a series of incremental demonstrations:<br />&bull; OpenVPX: Backplane standard that uses serial fabrics with a high density connector, coupled with a systems level approach that defines standard profiles for pins, protocols, and interconnections. Additional information is available at http://www.vita.com/. <br />&bull; Vehicular Integration for C4ISR/EW Interoperability (VICTORY): Defines a network-based data bus called the VICTORY Data Bus (VDB) to integrate C4ISR/EW and platform systems on Army ground vehicles. Additional information is available at http://victory-standards.org/.<br />&bull; Modular Open RF Architecture (MORA): Extends VICTORY to support radio frequency (RF) systems. Decomposes monolithic radio systems into high-level components with well-defined functions and interfaces. Component types include Software Defined Radios (SDRs), RF Conditioning &amp; Distribution (RCDs), and Radioheads (RHDs). A RHD is typically the integration of the antenna (or multiple antennas) and RF conditioning circuits such as power amplifiers (PAs) and/or low noise amplifiers (LNAs). RCDs may exist between RHDs and SDRs. MORA also defines a low latency high speed bus, called the MORA Low Latency Bus (ML2B), to minimize platform discrete signaling needs. <br />&bull; REDHAWK: Software framework and associated interfaces intended to facilitate the development, deployment, and management of SDR applications. Additional information on the REDHAWK framework and associated interfaces is available at http://redhawksdr.github.io/Documentation/.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information<br />The primary purpose of this RFI is to get feedback on the draft MORA V2.0 specification in support of HW/SW Convergence and other initiatives. Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br />1. Software Defined Radio: Information on existing designs and the level of effort to transition those designs into MORA compliant designs which would utilize VDB and ML2B networks in future modular system implementations <br />2. RF Conditioning &amp; Distribution: Information on existing designs and the level of effort to transition those designs into MORA compliant designs which would utilize VDB and ML2B networks in future modular system implementations <br />3. Radiohead: Information on existing designs and the level of effort to transition those designs into MORA compliant designs which would utilize VDB and ML2B networks in future modular system implementations <br />4. MORA Signal Port interfaces (Analog &amp; Digital, Receive and Transmit) including the incorporation of VITA 49.2 context, control, and data packets for Digital IQ signal representation<br />5. Use of VITA 49.2 for digital RF distribution of data, context, and control between chassis resources and an advanced Radiohead which may host the traditional RF front end circuitry as well as advanced functions such as frequency conversion, digitization, and waveform generation<br />6. Off-the-shelf application software for processing RF signals in digital IQ format (VITA 49.2)<br />7. MORA Processing Port interfaces including possible Radiohead on-board processing to alleviate pre-detection data traffic (e.g. DF, spectrum FFTs)<br />8. Software development frameworks and operating environments for RF applications and waveforms<br />9. Use of REDHAWK in conjunction with hardware acceleration such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and digital signal processors (DSPs)<br />10. The combined use of the VDB for resource management and the use of the ML2B for low latency control messaging in a multi-enclave environment<br />11. The roadmap for Ethernet switches and IP cores that can support 40 Mbps and 100 Mbps for low latency messaging and potentially large digital data transfers from Radiohead(s) to/from resources in an OpenVPX chassis or local area network<br />12. Use of 10/40 Gigabit Ethernet to provide low latency, deterministic, and reliable messaging<br />13. The roadmap for advanced time synchronization protocols where highly accurate knowledge of time can be achieved without signal hardlines<br />14. Information on low SWaP-cost N-channel topologies and implementations that might be integrated into future Radioheads<br />15. Comments regarding CERDEC's converged architecture consisting of OpenVPX, MORA, VICTORY, and REDHAWK</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. <br />The General Services Administration (GSA) is providing assisted acquisition services for the Department of Defense (DoD) pursuant to an Inter agency Agreement (IA) entered into and administered in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 17.5, Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) guidance, and respective policies and procedures of DoD and GSA. <br />This announcement serves as a Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. This Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. The GSA is performing market research in order to determine the availability of firms which possess the capability and experience to execute all of the requirements described herein. This announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from firms with demonstrated experience and performance at the prime contractor level, and (2) to gauge the capability of those interested firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level. <br />No proposals are being requested or accepted in response to this RFI. This announcement does not obligate the Government to award a contract, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any preparation costs. <br />Requirement:<br />The anticipated formal solicitation is for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contract with a maximum value of $850M, over a five year ordering period. It is envisioned that the contract type(s) will be time and material (T&amp;M), labor hour, firm fixed price, and cost plus fixed fee. We anticipate awarding to no more than three firms.  There will be very discerning and difficult evaluation criteria which will include but will not be limited to direct, recent or current experience in the functional areas including working with the mission partners on similar QRC C4&amp;ISR efforts. This RFI/Sources Sought is NOT a request for proposals, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. We invite any size business concerns with the required experience to provide a capability statement in response to this RFI/Sources Sought. <br />There is a need to acquire specialized contractor support with demonstrated Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to respond to programmatic, engineering, and security needs in an increasingly joint environment to support the mission of the Remote Sensing and Command, Control, Communications &amp; Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (RS&amp;C4ISR) community.  The Department of Defense's (DoD) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) needs span across Technical Evaluation, Demonstration and Assessment, System Engineering, Information Assurance, Cyber Operations, DoD Infrastructure, manned and unmanned systems, Maritime Domain Awareness, remote sensing, training, Human Systems Integration, Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Electronic Warfare (EW) and Information Operations (IO), Modeling, Simulation, and Foreign Comparative Testing.  <br />The Scope of the IDIQ is to support development of Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRC) through streamlined acquisition processes, demonstrations, user Concept of Operations (CONOPS), technical assessments, and new system development that will support near-term and long term operational requirements within the National, DoD, and Intelligence Communities as well as non-DoD agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of the Treasury (DOT), Department of the Interior (DOI), and the Department of State (DOS). The Contractor will be expected to provide qualified personnel capable of performing highly technical, cutting-edge military research and development efforts as well as programmatic oversight services.
<p>Worldwide services are required. The services to be procured are non-personal and are not inherently Government functions. Activities to be performed include the performance of tasks and completion of products/deliverables for eight ISR functional categories that support all segments of the project/system/enterprise life-cycle process. Specific requirements will be tailored to the specific focus and requirements of that functional category.  The eight functional areas are: Technical Collection and Analysis, Manned and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I), and Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E),Studies, Modeling and Simulation, and Technical Support,  Forensics, Biometrics, and Signature Support,Cyber Technologies, Cyber Operations, Information Operations, Data, and C4 Knowledge Management, Logistics, Training, and Infrastructure Services Support. These functional areas are described in more detail the Attachment 1.<br />The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for these requirements is 541712. The business size standard for this NAICS is 1000 employees. Your response should identify your business size (large or small) in relation to this NAICS Code.</p>
<p>Security Requirements:<br />Personnel may be assigned to SCI facilities and must possess a minimum of a Top Secret Security Clearance, based on a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or Periodic Review (PR) for Top Secret.  Investigations will be completed within at least five years to allow for access to Top Secret level and for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and/or Special Access Program (SAP).  All technical documentation and data exchanged between the contractor and the Government shall be protected from public disclosure in accordance with the markings contained thereon (i.e., classified in accordance with appropriate DOD approved security classification directives and guides).<br />National Agency Checks (NACs) will be conducted, at a minimum, for all personnel in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R.  The contractor shall establish and administer personnel and physical security programs in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R and RAFI 31-101, Installation Security. The contractor shall be responsible for safeguarding all Government property provided for contractor use.  This contract requires that personnel have access to Privacy Information.  Personnel shall adhere to the Privacy Act, Title 5 of the U.S. Code, Section 552a and applicable agency rules and regulations.<br /> <br />Capabilities: <br />GSA is seeking Prime Contractors capable of performing in all eight functional areas, independently or through the use of Subcontractors and/or partners.  Interested firms must demonstrate QRC experience. Interested firms must have experience as a multiple award IDIQ holder. Interested firms must meet the Security Requirements.  Interested firms shall possess and demonstrate an in-depth understanding and experience in all eight functional areas described in the attachment.  <br /> Capability and Information Statement<br />The Government is requesting interested sources to provide sufficient information that demonstrates recent experience (within the last three (3) years) in providing the broad range of capabilities described above and in the Attachment to this RFI. Interested sources are requested to submit a brief Summary of Demonstrated Capabilities (no more than 20 pages) that addresses each of the functional areas listed in the attachment.  The response shall include previous scenarios, examples of past projects and deliverables that demonstrate experience and success in each of the functional areas.

<RESPDATE>042716
<CONTACT>Jennifer B. Mccaghren, Contracting Officer, Phone 256-961-7454, Email jennifer.b.mccaghren@nasa.gov
<DESC><p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) invites you to submit a response to this Request for Information (RFI) to assist NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in its National Space Science Technology Center Research Facility (NSSTC) acquisition planning. The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) solicits information from Government, academic, and industrial communities pertaining to the technology needs for grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes with large aperture areas and fine (sub-arc second) angular resolution. Specifically, MSFC seeks this information to assist in assessing current technology capabilities, identifying promising development paths, and evaluating feasibility and schedule for maturing these technologies.</p>
<p>The NASA Astrophysics science vision, as outlined in the "Enduring Quests, Daring Visions" roadmap1, <br />highlights X-ray optics as a key area where significant technology advances are needed to achieve the <br />observational capabilities required to address key science objectives. More quantitatively, the 2015 <br />Physics of the Cosmos Program Annual Technology Report2 identifies performance goals and objectives <br />for lightweight high-resolution X-ray optics that feature (1) angular resolution of 0.5 arcsecond or better, <br />(2) effective area up to 3 square meters in the roughly 0.1 to 10 keV range, (3) light weight ( 1 kg/m2 <br />areal density) mirrors, and (4) low cost ( 1M$/m2 mirror surface area). Such advanced X-ray optics are <br />needed to enable future strategic missions such as the X-ray Surveyor, a mission concept currently<br />under study in preparation for the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey3. Historically, X-ray focusing <br />telescopes have relied on grazing-incidence reflective optics (typically 2 reflections) to bring X rays to a <br />focus. Large effective collecting areas are achieved by nesting multiple co-aligned, co-axial grazing-<br />incidence mirror pairs in order to optimize the available aperture. Consequently, large-effective-area X-<br />ray telescopes must use thin, lightweight mirrors to achieve a high degree of nesting and acceptably low <br />mass. For such mirrors, angular resolution is affected by internal stresses, coating-induced stresses, and<br />mounting-induced distortions that cause medium- to large-scale figure errors. Therefore, in addition to <br />requiring technology that can inexpensively fabricate large numbers of precisely figured thin shells or <br />shell segments, future high-resolution mirror development must show capability to coat and to align and <br />mount precisely formed mirrors, possibly with (static or active) post-fabrication figure correction. <br />Several examples of technologies currently under development for producing precision figured thin x-<br />ray mirrors are reviewed in O'Dell et al. (2014).</p>
<p>MSFC solicits information pertaining to these and related technological challenges for timely and cost-<br />effective production of lightweight, large-area sub-arcsecond grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes. The <br />information obtained through this RFI will be compiled, summarized, and made available to the X-ray <br />Surveyor STDT who will identify and assess technology gaps in order to inform NASA's programmatic <br />funding priorities.</p>
<p>Requested Information:</p>
<p>Recognizing that robust development and maturation of technologies for X-ray telescopes is crucial to a <br />compelling and executable X-ray Surveyor mission concept, this RFI seeks input that will help define (1) <br />the current state of the art in terms of capability and readiness, (2) the feasibility and schedule for <br />raising the corresponding Technology Readiness Level (TRL), and (3) new and emerging technologies <br />and/or significant engineering alternatives. This RFI seeks input on the following topics: high-resolution <br />light-weight mirror fabrication processes, mirror coating processes and methods for stress mitigation; <br />static and active post-fabrication figure correction techniques; mounting and assembly schemes; <br />alignment; metrology; and mass production approaches to any of these topics. Responses should <br />provide, at a minimum, (1) a description of the technology, what technological challenge it addresses <br />and how it confronts that challenge in the context of the desired sub-arc second, large-area X-ray optic <br />(2) an estimate of the current Technology Readiness Level and a justification for that estimate (3) a plan <br />and schedule for advancing the technology to TRL 6.</p>
<p>This is a RFI only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NASA will take procurement action in this matter. Further, neither NASA nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.</p>
<p>This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information and Planning Purposes". This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time, and this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Moreover, the Government will not pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI, nor will the Government reimburse for costs incurred to prepare responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>Instructions for Responding to this RFI:</p>
<p>All responses to this RFI must be in the form of a PDF document submitted in electronic form via email to jennifer.b.mccaghren@nasa.gov. The body of the email message should identify and provide the name, institutional or organizational affiliation, address, telephone number and email address of the primary point-of-contact for the response.

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>HOW TO OFFER: </strong>The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future requirements.&nbsp; The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period&rsquo;.&nbsp; Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the &ldquo;Register to Offer Space&rdquo; link and follow the instructions to register.&nbsp; Instructional guides are offered in the &ldquo;HELP&rdquo; tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period&rsquo;*. For assistance with the application, email AAAP.Manager@gsa.gov.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Open Period for <strong>April</strong> is <strong>April 1, 2016 to April 7, 2016,</strong> ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.&nbsp; The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.&nbsp; The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.&nbsp; Building/space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).&nbsp; Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.&nbsp; During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2016 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>OCCUPANCY: </strong>Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<SOLNBR>W912WJ-16-X-0018
<RESPDATE>041516
<CONTACT>Robert Garrahan, Contract Specialist, Phone 9783188814, Email Robert.C.Garrahan@USACE.Army.mil
<DESC>&nbsp;The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for Federal Maintenance Dredging of the Housatonic River Federal Navigation Project in Stratford, CT. This announcement is to determine interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns for this project. The project is planned to be issued on or about June 2016. The dredging window, due to environmental constraints, is estimated to be October 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017. The project is expected to take several months. The estimated construction cost is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.
<p>Project Description: This project consists of the dredging of approximately 225,000 cubic yards (cy) of clean fine-grain sand from the authorized 18-foot-deep and 200-foot-wide Federal channel, with placement of the dredged material directly onto Hammonasset Beach State Park in Madison, CT, approximately 40 miles from the dredge site. Dredging may be accomplished by either mechanical means or by hopper dredge. It is anticipated that a booster pump, an unloader or similar equipment will be needed to pump the sand directly onto the beach from the scow or hopper. Although the estimated dredge window is October 1 to January 31, the actual period for dredging could be narrower if there are delays associated with receipt of funds or required permits Dredging operations will be permitted 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.</p>
<p>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following: business classification (i.e. HUBZone, small business, etc.), a proof of bonding as well as what type of equipment would be utilized for this project. Please indicate your subcontractor team that will be used to support your effort and include their prior experience. Additionally, firms must demonstrate their project experience, within the last five years, in the following work requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Dredging by mechanical means or with a hopper dredge a minimum of 80,000 cubic yards in a consecutive 30-day period in cold-weather months (October through January).</p>
<p>&bull; Experience in placement of sand on a beach from a scow or hopper dredge.</p>
<p>&bull; Experience in the grading of sand placed on a beach to construct a beach berm or an improved beach profile.</p>
<p><br />The Government anticipates including a definitive responsibility criterion in the solicitation and contract resulting from this market research. After bid opening but prior to award, the apparent low bidder will be required to furnish documentation that demonstrates that the prime contractor or subcontractor responsible for dredging has dredged by mechanical means or hopper a minimum of 80,000 cubic yards in a consecutive 30-day period in a cold-weather month (October through January) with disposal/placement onto a beach.</p>

1.	Description of the proposed requirement:

a. VA-DMC relies on a conglomerate of legacy Common Business-Oriented Language (COBOL), Natural, JAVA and JAVNat computer code produced over a period of 35 years to perform its mission. VA-DMC uses two primary IT systems - CARS and CAROLS and their associated databases. These legacy systems are built on older COBOL code and have been periodically updated over the past three decades. VA-DMC wishes to replace these systems but requires updated business requirements and a technical migration plan in order to do so. Business logic and process flow for the original system, as well as a portion of the updates are not available, and VA-DMC also intends to add new functionality beyond what currently exists.

Therefore, VA-DMC requires contractor support to document the existing functionality of CARS/CAROLS, identify non-functioning code, review the business logic of the existing functionality, and to identify requirements for new functionality for the replacement system(s). VA-DMC requires a technical migration plan and contractor project management support for the development and implementation of the new system(s).

Minimum services include: analysis of current system, analysis of business flow/logic, identify the size of current JavaNat and Job Control Language (JCL) applications, creation of a technical migration plan, creation of a project management plan, support for implementation of plans and integration of systems, oversight of development, conformance with Project Management Accountability System (PMAS) requirements including creating of all PMAS documents and artifacts where applicable. Provide quality assurance (process) and provide quality control (product) throughout the enhancement project.

Minimum documentation required: CARS code analysis documentation including business logic review, technical migration plan document, technology road map, solution design, project management plan document and required subsidiary documents, PMAS artifacts as required by phase and required subsidiary inputs. Provide status updates once every two weeks. The contractor awarded this requirement will be prohibited from competing on any of the follow-on work to develop and implement the new system(s).

* Please note the order of increments below is for reference purposes only.  The actual increments may change based on the solution design and migration plan.

- Increment 3. Data warehouse creation
- Increment 4. Information enhancement / relational database creation
- Increment 5. Business Rules Management System implementation
- Increment 6. Reports and analytics server creation
- Increment 7. Bulk mailings and letters enhancement
- Increment 8. User interface creation / enhancement
- Increment 9. Data file interchange / batch process enhancement
- Increment 10. Implementation of Continuity of Operations Plan

i. Would you need to subcontract personnel in order to meet the requirement? If so, are you confident that you could abide within the limitations of subcontracting clause (if respondent is small business)?

ii. Do you believe any aspects of this requirement could be issued on a firm-fixed-price basis, rather than issued on a labor hour basis? Please describe your rationale.

iii. The client believes the above requirement can be accomplished utilizing between four and eight Full Time Equivalents, and estimates the following labor categories (LCAT) are required for this effort: one system integrator / senior Project Manager (PM), one PM, one COBOL analyst, one data architect, one technical writer, two business analysts and one software architect. Do you believe these LCATs (or similar) to be a logical representation of the LCATs required to meet the requirement? Please explain or provide the LCATs your company believes to be best suited for this effort.

Iv. The client is considering using Micro Focus Enterprise Analyzer to analyze the current code, identify shortfalls in functionality, understand business logic and process flow as well as identify improvement opportunities. Describe your experience using Enterprise Analyzer to analyze current COBOL code. Would you recommend another code analyzer solution? 

v. What is your company's experience with VA policies and regulations regarding security, Personally Identifiable Information, 508 compliance, and Technical Reference Model approved software?

GENERAL INTENT<br />a. Background<br />The Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate Battlespace Environment Center (AFRL/RVBY) would like to investigate scientific solutions to Nuclear Explosion Monitoring (NEM) problems with improving regional and local seismic discrimination and yield estimation, improving structural models of the earth for seismic attenuation &amp; velocity and for full seismic waveform modeling, improving methods of collecting location and discrimination ground truth for seismic events, improving seismic signal processing for seismic detection, signal association, location and discrimination, and understanding seismic source physics of explosions and other events such as earthquakes that may improve seismic discrimination. Such solutions would require scientific studies of the type published in scientific journals with presentation at scientific meetings and peer review throughout the process.</p>
<p>b. Approach</p>
<p>The primary goal of this RFI is to obtain information on potential scientific solutions for these challenges.</p>
<p>c. Description</p>
<p>Government Objective: AFRL/RVBY requests brief summaries of potential scientific solutions for problems in seismic source physics, discrimination and yield estimation, earth models of attenuation, velocity and full waveforms, ground truth for discrimination and location, and data processing. For each of these categories, possible examples of scientific solutions follow. Summaries of scientific solutions are welcomed on these or in other research directions.</p>
<p>Seismic Source Physics: Generally, new ways to improve predictions of source generation of seismic signals, from all shallow source types, that may be used for discrimination and/or yield estimation. Ways to improve physical understanding of the dependence of seismic source generation on explosion emplacement conditions (depth, scaled depth, decoupling, material properties, pre-stress, and local structure/topography), especially for small shallow seismic events. Hypothesis tests of proposed mechanisms for anomalous waveform characteristics, e.g. larger surface waves than predicted for explosions. Distinguishing between feasible source mechanisms. Methods of determining depth to within 10s of meters for shallow and very shallow events. Partitioning of energy into P, S, and surface waves, understanding of the higher frequencies that may be critical for local discrimination, and methods that can discriminate chemical from nuclear explosions. Summaries may include one or multiple approaches, and may include analysis of existing nuclear and chemical explosion records, theoretical investigations, and/or numerical simulations.</p>
<p>Discrimination and Yield Estimation: New discriminants that take advantage of the characteristics of small locally (200 km or less) recorded events or of local propagation effects. Assessment of extensions of successful regional discriminants to local distances: what conditions affect the performance at local distances does this work or not work. Rigorous assessments of local discriminant performance and uncertainty, and of the physical bases for their success or failure. Ways to provide new understanding of the properties of small seismic events and their seismic waveforms at local and regional (2,000 km or less) distances. Ways to improve the accuracy of existing discriminants and estimates of their uncertainty or that develop new discriminants that have a firm physical and statistical basis. Methods for estimating yield of seismic events recorded at local distances with low uncertainty. At regional distances, improving event characterization of smaller events as well as improving understanding of uncertainties. Methods to improve the accuracy of source characterization by moment tensors and their uncertainties, and new understanding of their limitations, especially for smaller events recorded at higher frequencies (e.g. 10-20 seconds period).</p>
<p>Attenuation and Full Waveform Earth Models: Ways to improve the prediction of waveforms and amplitudes at local and regional distances. In particular, local/regional attenuation and scattering models, with emphasis on their ability to match observed amplitudes of Pn, Pg, Sn, and Lg phases, their codas, and surface waves; assessment of the extent and effects of censoring and application of appropriate methods to address censoring; new methods for measuring attenuation; models that fit multiple datasets (e.g. body wave and surface wave amplitudes), if the potential to improve predictions that affect discrimination can be shown; and methods that utilize full waveforms and finite-frequency methods. Methods that account for 3D structural effects on amplitudes. In all cases, a robust estimate of uncertainty is an important consideration (confidence, resolution, and variance).</p>
<p>Velocity Earth Models: Ways to develop advanced models of the Earth's velocity structure that will improve location capability. In particular, (1) P-wave velocity structure studies and studies of poorly calibrated regions within Eurasia; (2) new techniques of determining 3-D, spatially variable velocity models; (3) new techniques for building models by fitting multiple datasets, especially of different types of data, if the potential to improve predictions that affect location can be shown; (4) techniques to estimate the uncertainty in geophysical models and assess the tradeoffs between different parameters of the models, as well as the uncertainty (confidence, resolution, and variance) in predicted observables, such as travel times; (5) new techniques for determining velocity structure in aseismic regions; (6) studies that compare different methods to show their strengths and weaknesses; and models that can predict structural effects on seismic amplitudes at 1 Hz and higher as well as travel times. Solutions utilizing full waveforms and finite-frequency methods. Techniques for accurately predicting P-wave travel times from surface wave based models.</p>
<p>Location and Discrimination Ground Truth: Solutions to improve the collection of calibration events at a GT5 level (absolute location and depth errors less than 5 kilometers) or better in uncalibrated or very poorly calibrated areas. Studies that generate new discrimination calibration events, along with source geometry and other characterizing information. Accurate estimates of depth and origin time and their uncertainties are potentially important for location calibration events. Improved techniques for event location using models and/or ground truth at local, regional or near-teleseismic distances, particularly methods that use more than a single type of data jointly. Robust estimation of uncertainty is an important consideration.</p>
<p>Data Processing: New and innovative signal processing methods for data from local (less than 200 km) and regional (less than 2,000 km) distances that significantly lower the thresholds at which detection, location and identification functions can be performed at an acceptable false alarm rate. Extension of existing state-of-the art single station and array methods to networks to reduce detection, location and identification thresholds. Ways to increase the efficiency of the real-time automated process of constructing thousands of unique seismic events to low thresholds from millions of detections on hundreds of seismic sensors, combining local, regional, and teleseismic seismic signals. Ways to enable the incorporation of orders of magnitude larger seismic networks and seismic data streams, including rapidly changing networks. In particular, ways to reduce the computational burdens of global signal association for event construction for such systems. Solutions that are tuning studies, either of specific arrays or of techniques in general, are not scientific in nature.</p>
<p>These options are presented to allow responders to assess potential approaches and scientific risks and costs.</p>
<p>d. Response</p>
<p>Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead and include the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Potential solution to meet one of the Government objectives;<br />(2) Scientific plan of study;<br />(3) Time phased research plan (schedule);<br />(4) Rough order of magnitude cost estimate correlated to schedule;<br />(5) Premises and assumptions; and<br />(6) Risk assessment.</p>

<DESC>Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole source contract to Siemens Energy, Inc., 1345 Ridgeland Parkway Suite 116 Alpharetta, GA 30004 for the design, equipment and installation required for replacement of medium voltage switchgear and primary unit substations. The Building 780 medium voltage switchgear replacement project includes demolishing obsolete 6.9kV switchgear and controls and providing new Siemens switchgear and controls. In addition, the work includes all equipment and installation required for replacement of the MC1 and MC4 medium voltage switchgear in Building 780 and replacing with new medium voltage Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS).
<p>AEDC has the need to procure medium voltage switchgear that is reliable and safe. Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) is the latest technology that provides power without requiring personnel to be equipped with arc flash personal protective equipment (PPE) while operating or maintaining the GIS equipment. Hours of industry wide research, competitive bidding, and accepted maintenance and reliability practice have resulted in the conclusion that Siemens Type 8DA10 Gas Insulated Switchgear is the only switchgear that confines each of the three phases of power in three separate compartments. This is a critical requirement from a safety standpoint and mitigates electrical fault severity to avoid costly shutdowns of the entire system. With the isolation of the phases a factory-trained Siemens employee can remove the damaged phase and replace it with the identical part from a spare cubicle, and return the cubicle to service in a short amount of time. In most cases this work can be completed with the remainder of the switchgear lineup still in service. If spares are available, a new enclosure could be installed from the spare cubicle but the entire lineup would be unavailable throughout the duration of the repair.</p>

This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.

<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>

<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT
<p>The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SEVENCs GmbH Zirkusweg 1 Hamburg Germany 20359 using the procedures in FAR Part 13, to provide 35 concurrent SevenCs software licenses.  The Marine Chart Division produces over 1000 Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) that cover the territorial waters of the United States.  These products have been mandated by the International Maritime Organization to be carried on large commercial vessels for safe navigation.  In order to produce a compliant ENC to the standards set by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) it must be validated against their S-58 standard.</p>
<p>Currently MCD needs to provide an additional tool to provide quality control for its ENC production.  SevenCs provides ENC validation checks in a single software package that runs on a concurrent license server.  This means, that by procuring a set of 35 concurrent licenses it will be able to meet the production needs of 80 employees for ENC validation.  This will also allow MCD to reduce overall software maintenance costs.</p>
<p>ENC Analyzer is a package that incorporates the International Hydrographic Organizations S-58 Recommended ENC Validation Checks into a single software package.  The Marine Chart Division will utilize this package as an additional check to ensure that NOAA ENCs adhere to the international S-57 standard for ENC.  The Marine Chart Division needs to be able to maintain second independent checking software to continue to produce ENC's for the mariner.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), Only one responsible source.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 541511 Application Software Programming Services, Custom Computer. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by 11:00am, March 30, 2016 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Tameka.Long@noaa.gov by 11:00am, March 30, 2016.</p>

<DESC>The FY17 JPC-1/MSIS INter-professional TEam-based Learning in Early Stages of Learning (Team_INTEL) is seeking research to determine, define, and validate learning strategies that foster inter-professional team-based learning during the early stages i.e. when teams are forming and groups are becoming familiar with each other and are starting to implement their roles and responsibilities of medical skills training in order to eliminate the current culture of focusing on the individual's medical skills and leaving team training practice at a later date during "on the job training."
<p>&bull; It is expected that award recipients will use statistical approaches to determine the best metrics and evaluation criteria that will objectively assess a foundation on team-based learning training practice guideline(s);</p>
<p>&bull; It is expected that award recipients will provide definitions to the metrics and evaluation criteria that will be objectively or subjectively collected, and provide the respective measurement tools (either currently commercially available or to be developed via this anticipated award mechanism);</p>
<p>&bull; It is expected that award recipients will utilize inter-professional teams from different clinical practice skillsets (i.e., novice through experts; different areas of military services);</p>
<p>&bull; It is encouraged that the validation of member team skills are not based solely on student learners, as team leaders are typically more advanced learners of a higher rank and need to be included to measure true effectiveness of the team effectiveness training program;</p>
<p>&bull; It is expected that award recipients will include a <br />model of training that should be able to be used across the services, throughout the continuum of care, and in various military team-based environments from Roles 1-45;</p>
<p>&bull; It is expected that the Team_INTEL should be adaptive to teaching not only student learners new to a TBL environment but include those who have been in team environments and can influence and alter unproductive team behavior practices;</p>
<p>&bull; It is anticipated that the outcomes of the research will result in a model that is implemented into data/knowledge systems and tested in a lab-type environment. Actual interfaces will need to be described and defined in the outcome;</p>
<p>&bull; It is anticipated that many of these variables, metrics, and evaluation criteria will be employed across the military, Veterans Health Administration, academic, inpatient, outpatient clinics, rural healthcare settings, private and public hospitals, and international healthcare situations;</p>
<p>&bull; It is anticipated that research outcomes, analysis, methodologies, and conclusions will be disseminated and propagated to the military and the Government, but also to the public at large. Public benefits from this research are encouraged.<br /><br />Interest/eligible applicants are instructed to visit www.grants.gov to access the full announcement at http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=282543</p>

<SUBJECT>Medical Simulation and Information Sciences - Predictive Personality & Emotional State Performance Determinants for Training (PREEMPT)
<SOLNBR>W81XWH16RMSI1
<RESPDATE>082916
<CONTACT>Jesse Hoffman, Phone 3016192765, Email jesse.m.hoffman2.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>PREEMPT seeks the development of a proof-of-concept task performance assessment tool that incorporates personality and emotional state as determinant components to predict an individual's performance and overall stress level under a wide range of potential combat casualty care scenarios, environments, and other stressful situations relevant to patient care. For this award, it is anticipated that the various components will be integrated for initial testing purposes in a laboratory setting to evaluate how the components work together. The FY16 JPC-1/MSIS PREEMPT is seeking research on two (2) of the several predictors of an individual's performance: personality and emotional state. This knowledge can be used to:
<p>&bull; Assess an individual's overall performance and stress levels during combat casualty care scenarios;<br />&bull; Deconstruct overall performance into its personality and emotional state determinants and assess each;<br />&bull; Combine the determinants to predict the person's overall performance on known tasks, especially as it applies to performance under stress.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this announcement, personality will be defined as that set of non-physical characteristics which distinguishes one individual from another.<br />For the purposes of this announcement, emotional states are interpretations of complex states that best describe a person's subjective response to a person, thing, or situation. Emotional states indirectly affect behavior.</p>
<p>The focus of the research should concentrate on those wishing to become military combat medics, corpsmen, pararescuemen, or special operations combat medics, but could consider other populations that are nearly equivalent. The pilot study should consider an individual's performance compared against currently used standards for military entry within the respective area. If unable to use a standard for military entry, then the applicant should justify the proposed standard that the organization perceives as nearly equivalent, especially if there are data-driven outcomes for individuals who have trained using standards vs. those who have not. The assessment tool(s) could also potentially be used for sustainment of task performance and overall stress level assessment in refresher / sustainment courses.</p>
<p>For completeness, task difficulty needs to be described and defined and, if applicable, evaluation criteria provided with a description of the measurement tool. Task difficulty and conditions should be held constant in the proposed project.</p>
<p>In summary, an individual's performance on a task in a specific environment at a moment in time can be specified in terms of the individual's personality, emotional state, and task difficulty. This means that the observed task performance is the final common pathway of the complex interplay of the task determinants. The goal of this program is to identify the personality and emotional state determinants of individual performance in order to determine how to better select the right people for specific tasks in certain scenarios, environments, and stressful situations and how to improve individual performance across tasks and environments.<br /><br />Interest/eligible applicants are instructed to visit www.grants.gov to access the full announcement at http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=282568</p>

ALTERNATE PROPOSALS<br />Alternate proposals will NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2: Evaluation -- Commercial Items <br />(a) The Government will award one contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor One: Cost/Price (Volume I)<br />Factor Two: Technical Capability (Volume II)<br />Subfactor 1: Manpower and Staffing Plan<br />Subfactor 2: Employee Hiring, Training and Certification Plan<br />Subfactor 3: FOD/DOP and Safety Program Plan<br />Factor Three - Past Performance (Volume III)</p>
<p>Note: Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options will not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, will result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2, EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS<br />A. Basis for Contract Award</p>
<p>1. This acquisition will be a best value utilizing the Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) process. Evaluation will be in accordance with FAR 12.6 and as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), and Air Force Mandatory Procedures. <br />2. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror agrees to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. All technically acceptable offers will be considered equal. The tradeoff will occur only between the past performance factor and the price factor as stated below in the evaluation process: <br />B. Evaluation Process</p>
<p>1. All offers will be evaluated for technical acceptability. After being determined to be technically acceptable, offers will be ranked by price and will receive a performance confidence assessment rating based on past performance information, in accordance Factor 3 of this addendum. If the lowest priced evaluated offeror is evaluated to have "Substantial Confidence" performance rating and the offerors are determined to be responsible, the said offeror will represent the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any of the other offerors.</p>
<p>2. If the lowest priced offeror for is not evaluated to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating, the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is found to have "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>3. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the Instruction to Offerors, provided in clause 52.212-1, to permit a meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>4. If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision. If the offeror's proposal has been evaluated as acceptable at the time discussions are closed, any changes or exceptions in the Final Proposal Revision are subject to evaluation and may introduce risk that the offeror's proposal be determined unacceptable and ineligible for award.</p>
<p>C. Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors and Subfactors</p>
<p>The following evaluation factors and subfactors will be used to evaluate each proposal. Award will be made to the offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and subfactors described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Cost/Price<br />Factor 2: Technical Capability<br />Subfactor 1: Manpower and Staffing Plan<br />Subfactor 2: Employee Hiring, Training and Certification Plan<br />Subfactor 3: FOD/DOP and Safety Program Plan<br />Factor 3 - Past Performance</p>
<p>The relative importance of each factor and subfactors is as follows: As listed, Factor 2 (Technical) and Factor 3 (Past Performance) are equal in importance, and when combined are significantly more important than Factor 1 (Price). Within the Technical Factor, the subfactors are not in any order of importance; they are equally important. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>1. FACTOR 1- COST/PRICE</p>
<p>(a) The Government will review the offerors cost/price proposal for completeness, balance, and reasonableness.</p>
<p>(b) Completeness: The Government will review the offerors price proposal for completeness. For pricing to be considered complete, the offeror must have submitted a price for each CLIN in Section (v) and have provided a fully loaded labor rate for overtime hours. The extended price, yearly totals and Total Evaluated Price must be calculated. Unit prices shall not be extended beyond two decimal places. Failure to provide complete pricing may result in a proposal being determined "non-responsive" and therefore unawardable. <br />(c) Price Reasonableness<br />The Government will review the prices submitted in Section (v) Contract Line Item worksheet and the resultant TEP for Price Reasonableness. Pricing may be considered "unreasonable" if any specific unit price or if the TEP is significantly above the Government estimate or the median price of all Offerors for that specific element. Failure to provide reasonable prices may result in a proposal being rated unawardable. When adequate price competition exists, generally no additional information is necessary to determine the reasonableness of price. However, if adequate price competition does not exist the <br />Government may require submission of information other than cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to evaluate price criteria for reasonableness IAW FAR 15.403-1(b). <br />(d) Unbalanced CLIN Prices<br />Price analysis and evaluation of the information in the Price Volume will be used to determine if the prices for the proposed line items are balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total solicitation effort price, the price of one or more contract line items or sub line items appears to be significantly over or under-stated. Unbalanced pricing may result in an offer being rejected if the Government determines that it presents an unacceptable risk to the Government.<br />(e) Price Realism<br />Unrealistic prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from the competition based on an apparent lack of adequate understanding of the requirement or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program. Offerors are cautioned to not use underbidding as a pricing strategy with the intention of recovering under-bid costs after contract award via Requests for Equitable Adjustments (REAs) or other devices.<br />(f) Total Evaluated Price (TEP)<br />The offeror's Price will be evaluated for award purposes based upon the total evaluated price proposed for basic year and all options. The TEP will be calculated as the sum of all CLINs as defined in Section (v) Contract Line Items above. The overtime labor rate shall be evaluated for balance, reasonableness and realism by comparing against commercial market rates and or wage determination rates. The TEP will be provided to the Source Selection Authority (SSA) for consideration in the best value decision. Offerors whose price is determined to be unreasonable, unbalanced, or unaffordable may not be considered for award. <br />(g) FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services which allows the Government to extend services for up to six months at any time during contract performance and will be priced at the current rate if exercised, is included in this requirements and will be evaluated as follows. The evaluation is FOR EVAUATION PURPOSES ONLY and will not be included in the total amount of the potential contract award. The contractor shall not propose a price for the six month option; however, the option price will be evaluated by calculating six months at the monthly rate proposed for CLIN 2004. This amount will be calculated by the Government Pricing Team and will be included as part of the TEP. Evaluation of the six month extension option shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option. <br />2. FACTOR 2 - TECHNICAL PROPOSAL<br />(a) The offerors technical proposal will be evaluated for acceptability in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. The offeror's Technical Proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possesses adequate technical expertise and experience, possesses sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion to meet the needs of the Government. The Government will evaluate the offeror's Technical Proposal to ensure that the offeror can sufficiently perform the requirements within the PWS adequately with emphasis on the elements of the technical subfactors listed below. The Technical Proposal shall clearly demonstrate how the contractor will accomplish/satisfy the requirements. The Technical Proposal shall NOT simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the offeror intends to meet the requirements in the PWS. If an offeror simply rephrases/restates the PWS, their Technical Proposal will be deemed unacceptable. The Technical Proposal will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis and assigned one of the following ratings shown in Table 1 below:<br /><br />NOTE: If an offeror is found technically "unacceptable" whether initially or through discussions if conducted, the offeror will not be eligible for award and no further evaluations for price or past performance will be conducted.<br />(b) Technical Subfactor 1: Manpower &amp; Staffing Plan, meeting the requirements in PWS Section 3.1 Manpower Availability, Section 15 Hours of Operation, Section 16.1 Employee Clearance Requirements, and Section 18 Personnel specifically addressing Section 18.2 and 18.5.<br />Description: This subfactor evaluates the offeror's proposed capability in providing manpower and staffing plan to enable effective execution of the PWS requirements. The plan shall contain the following information:<br />(i) Projected manhours required per week to cover normal hours of operation. <br />(ii) A description of proposed labor categories, experience, and technical certifications clearly identifying the number and use of full and/or part time laborers.<br />(iii) An approach that demonstrates the ability to provide manpower coverage that will deliver a consistently flexible capability to support two to four simultaneous aircraft servicing operations during weekdays, weekends, and during 24/7 surged operations periods.<br />(iv) An approach for ensuring personnel will be able to obtain and retain appropriate drivers licenses to operate a motor vehicle on the flight line.<br />(v) An approach for obtaining secret security clearances.<br />Subfactor 1 is met when a descriptive manning and staffing strategy is provided that clearly demonstrates; a comprehensive approach to the requested information in "a" through "e" above, the offeror's ability to meet the manning requirements stated in the PWS, and that their strategy will provide adequate service coverage for the workload estimates contained in Appendix C of the PWS. <br />(c) Technical Subfactor 2: Employee Hiring, Training &amp; Certification Plan, meeting requirements in PWS Sections 18.2 Servicer Qualifications and 18.3 Personnel Records (employee technical skill &amp; experience validation), Section 19 Contractor Provided Training, and Section 20. Government Furnished Training.<br />Description: This subfactor evaluates the offeror's proposed approach to deliver an employee hiring, skill validation, and training strategy that delivers a Transient Alert team that is professional and competent across a variety of military aircraft types and aircraft servicing needs as specified in the PWS. The plan shall contain the following information: <br />(i) An approach for the recruitment of employees with the required technical skills and certifications. <br />(ii) A description of how technical skills will be validated.<br />(iii) An approach to how on-the-job and follow-on training will be implemented that will not disrupt day-to-day operations.<br />(iv) A description of how training, qualification, and certification records will be documented and maintained.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 is met when the offeror provides a plan that adequately explains the requested information in "a" through "d" above and clearly demonstrates the following: the ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, and the ability to provide a robust training program to ensure properly skilled and certified personnel.<br />(d) Technical Subfactor 3: FOD/DOP and Safety Program Plan, meeting PWS Section 3.7 Foreign Object Damage (FOD) and Dropped Object Prevention (DOP) Programs, and Section 3.10. Safety Program</p>
<p>Description: This subfactor evaluates the offeror's proposed overall approach in establishing and operating effective FOD/DOP and Safety Programs. The plan shall contain the following information: <br />(i) A description of employee roles.<br />(ii) A description of company policies. <br />(iii) A description of project management processes and how they align to ensure effective safety and FOD/DOP prevention protocols that will support and sustain the aircraft servicing operations and hours of operation requirements of the PWS without causing service degradation or loss of capability.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 is met when the offeror delivers a descriptive narrative that explains the requested information in "a" through "c" above. This subfactor should not be confused with the required Data Items for FOD Plan (CDRL D001) and Safety Plan (CDRL C001) under CLIN 0005, This subfactor will be to evaluate the offerors overall approach to these programs. The detailed individual plans will be required by the awardee after contract award IAW the respective CDRLs.</p>
<p>NOTE: All subfactors must clearly demonstrate the ability to support two to four simultaneous aircraft servicing operations if necessary during weekdays, weekends, and during 24/7 surged operations periods. Reference the PWS Appendix for workload estimates to aid in developing your proposal. <br />3. Factor 3: Past Performance</p>
<p>The Past Performance evaluation results in an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements. A past performance evaluation will be performed on the lowest priced offer found to be technically acceptable. Offerors will receive a Performance Confidence Assessment rating and a Relevancy Assessment rating; see tables 2 and 3 respectively. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is not found to have "substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating the government will evaluate the next lowest offer, this process will continue (in order by price) until an offer is found to have "Substantial Confindence" performance assessment rating or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>(a) Ratings</p>
<p>The Past Performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments ratings described below. <br />TABLE 2- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS<br />Rating Description<br />SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />LIMITED CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />NO <br />CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE (NEUTRAL) No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. <br />(b) Past Performance Evaluation Process</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in providing services that meet the contract's requirements. Performance confidence is assessed at the overall Past Performance factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the Technical subfactors and Price factor taking into consideration their relative order of importance stated in 52.212-2(a). The Government may consider past performance in the aggregate in addition to on an individual contract basis. In conducting the Past Performance evaluation, the Government reserves the right to use both the information provided in the offeror's Past Performance proposal volume and information obtained from other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Contractor Performance Assessment Retrieval System (CPARS), past performance questionnaires, government customer interviews, applicable commercial clients and any other source deemed necessary to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>(c) Recency Assessment</p>
<p>An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. To be recent, the effort must be either ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation for a minimum of six (6) months. Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>(d) Relevancy Assessment</p>
<p>An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is relevant. Relevancy in regards to scope is based on the similarities between a given past performance effort and the requirements of this effort, which is defined by the PWS. Relevancy in regards to magnitude is based on the similarities between a given past performance effort and this TA requirement in terms of overall contract value with a minimum value of $150K annually. Past performance references in excess of the given limit will not be evaluated. A relevancy determination of the offeror's past performance will be made based upon the aforementioned considerations, including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s) performing more than 25% of the services. In determining the relevancy of effort performed under individual past performance contracts, the government will only consider the specific effort or portion consistent with that proposed by the prime, subcontractor or teaming partner. The past performance information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the relevancy of past performance. The Government will use the following relevancy definitions when assessing recent, relevant contracts:</p>
<p>Table 3 - Rating Definition<br />VERY RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>SOMEWHAT RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>NOT RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p><br />(e) Performance Quality Assessment</p>
<p>The Government will consider the performance quality of recent, relevant efforts (how well the contractor performed on the contracts). For each recent past performance citation reviewed, the performance quality of the work performed will be assessed for the technical subfactors and price factor, however all aspects of performance that relate to this acquisition may be considered. The quality assessment consists of an in-depth evaluation of all past performance information available, regardless of its source. The Government will use the following quality levels when assessing recent, relevant efforts:</p>
<p>Table 4 - Quality Assessment Rating/Color Description<br />EXCEPTIONAL (E)/BLUE During the contract period, contractor performance is meeting (or met) all contract requirements and consistently exceeding (or exceeded) many. Very few, if any, minor problems encountered. Contractor took immediate and effective corrective action.</p>
<p>VERY GOOD (VG)/PURPLE During the contract period, contractor is meeting (or met) all contract requirements and consistently exceeding (or exceeded) some. Some minor problems encountered. Contractor took timely corrective action.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY (S)/GREEN During the contract period, contractor performance is meeting (or met) all contract requirements. For any problems encountered, contractor took effective corrective action.</p>
<p>MARGINAL (M)/YELLOW During the contract period, contractor performance is not meeting (or did not meet) some contract requirements. For problems encountered, corrective action appeared only marginally effective, not effective, or not fully implemented. Customer involvement was required.</p>
<p>UNSATISFACTORY(U)/RED During the contract period, contractor performance is failing (or fail) to meet most contract requirements. Serious problems encountered corrective actions were either ineffective or non-existent. Extensive Customer oversight and involvement was required.<br />NOT APPLICABLE (N)/WHITE Unable to provide a rating. Contract did not include performance for this aspect. Do not know.</p>
<p>As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated Performance Confidence Assessment rating; see Table 2 above. Although the past performance evaluation focuses on performance that is relevant to the technical subfactors and price factor, the resulting Performance Confidence Assessment rating is made at the factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance. Offerors without a record of recent/relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "Unknown Confidence" rating for the Past Performance factor.</p>
<p>More recent performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than less recent or relevant effort. A strong record of relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown Confidence" rating. Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance.</p>

The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong><br />These Lotion, Sunscreen products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at <a href="https://www.medical.dla.mil/">https://www.medical.dla.mil/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the subject QSL. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of three (3) years (36 months) from date of selection, with one (1) 24-month "option" period not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is May 2016. Among vendors who are on the subject QSL, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Lotion, Sunscreen.&nbsp; <br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Lotion, Sunscreen. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $739,031 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.&nbsp; <br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the subject QSL who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO South via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission</span><br />The pricing requirements are outlined below.

Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />Mr. Joe Winter, RN, MMESO South Clinical Analyst, joseph.n.winter.ctr@mail.mil, (210) 536-6072; Mr. David Sheaffer, MMESO South, Team Leader, david.v.sheaffer.ctr@mail.mil, (210) 536-6075.

The minimum contract guarantee is $10,000 and maximum order amount is $900,000. Award will be made to the contractor whose proposal provides the best value to the Government. Due to the fact that the Government is seeking a vendor who can provide the technical hardware, subscriptions services, and experience/expertise most directly related to the Statement of Work (SOW), the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offer if the Government determines that the additional cost is justified in return for the perceived benefits set forth in the contractor's technical proposal. The Source Selection Authority (SSA) will perform an integrated best value assessment of the evaluated offerors and document the merits of the trade-off in price and that the price is fair and reasonable. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Proposals will be priced only on the following Contract Line Items structure. Any proposal that does not provide pricing according to the outlined structure will be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submission Requirements</span><br /><br />1.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provisions and Clauses<br /></span><br />FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offers (Oct 2015) - Commercial applies to this acquisition and there are no addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Oct 2014) is applicable to this acquisition as follows;</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />Technical capability and past performance, when combined, is equally as important as price. The non-price factors are all of equal value to each other.<br />The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal that includes any assumptions that adversely impacts the Government's requirements. <br /><br />(i) FACTOR 1 - Technical Capability<br />The offers will be evaluated on overall technical capability, which is the ability to meet the minimum requirements outlined in the SOW, the ability and special features of the proposed hardware and its relevance to the wildland fire mission, as well as the following factors:<br />(a) The Government's technical evaluation board shall evaluate the technical proposals to ensure they meet all SOW minimum technical requirements/specifications. Value/merit will be assigned based upon which if any target features are included in the proposal and the perceived benefit of each target feature to the intended use of the hardware and service.<br />(b) The Government will assess the perceived level of effort required in the installation process of proposed hardware. Value/merit will be assigned based upon the complexity and resultant cost of hardware installation to the Government. <br />(c) For the purpose of evaluation the Offeror must submit technical documentation for hardware and service being proposed. Technical proposal shall clearly identify characteristics that fulfill the minimum requirements in the SOW. Proposal shall clearly identify which if any of the target features identified in the SOW the hardware and service satisfy.</p>
<p>(ii) FACTOR 2 - Price<br />Each price proposed shall be evaluated to determine its reasonableness for the effort proposed and to determine the demonstrated understanding of the level of effort needed to successfully perform the requirements of the SOW. Award may not necessarily be made to the offeror submitting the lowest priced offer. The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or sub line items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest of the Government. Additional factors for evaluation include:<br />(a) The Government will evaluate the competitiveness, realism, and reasonableness of the pricing, including any discounts offered as a total sum of the base period and all option periods. <br />(b) The Government will evaluate the cost/benefit of obtaining certain target features (as defined in the SOW) as it relates to price and make a best value determination for award. <br />(c) For the purpose of price evaluation the Offeror must submit a completed prototypical project pricing matrix (Appendix 1).</p>
<p>(iii) FACTOR 3 - Past Performance<br />Past performance is a measure of the degree to which the offeror has previously satisfied customers in the performance of the efforts/requirements identified in the SOW. Additional factors for evaluation include: <br />(a) The Government will evaluate the relevance and recentness of past performance of the offeror and its relation to the SOW requirements. <br />(b) For the purpose of past performance evaluation the Offeror must submit completed past performance questionnaires (Appendix 2) for each performance event to be considered.</p>
<p><em>Evaluation Plan<br /></em><br />Definitions<br /><br />Deficiency: An aspect of the proposal that fails to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that raises the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. <br /><br />Recent Performance: is defined as contracts performed within the last three years. <br />Relevant Performance: Includes performance of efforts involving same type supplies and services that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in the SOW.<br /><br />Significant Strength: An outstanding or exceptional aspect of a proposal that appreciably increases the Government's confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform contract requirements.<br /><br />Significant Weakness: A proposal flaw that appreciably increases the chance of unsuccessful performance.<br /><br />Strength: A significant outstanding or exceptional aspect of a proposal that exceeds the minimum evaluation standard.<br /><br />Weakness: A flaw in the proposal that decreases the Government's confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform contract requirements.</p>
<p><br />Technical Capability<br />The government will conduct a subjective assessment of performance risk based upon the technical capabilities of the offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the SOW requirements. The Government will evaluate the proposals inclusion of target features outlined in the SOW. Technical evaluation of proposals will only include the factors and sub-factors listed above.</p>
<p>The following adjectives will be used in assessing technical capabilities:</p>
<p>TABLE 1 - TECHNICAL FACTOR EVALUATION RATINGS</p>
<p>Exceptional - Exceeds minimum technical expectations and includes a significant amount if not all identified target features and specifications. Reflects an innovative approach and/or superior understanding of the requirement in a way beneficial to the Government; proposal must have one or more strengths and no deficiencies and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Acceptable - Meets minimum technical expectations with little to no target features or specifications included. Reflects sound approach and/or satisfactory understanding of the requirement; proposal may have one or more strengths and may have a minor weakness but no deficiencies.<br /><br />Marginal - Does not clearly meet technical expectations. Reflects an uncertain approach and/or incomplete understanding of the requirement. Proposal contains multiple weaknesses but no deficiencies.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements; proposal has multiple weaknesses and one or more deficiencies. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>Past Performance<br />The Government will conduct a subjective assessment of performance risk based upon the past performance of the offerors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the SOW requirements. A contractor with no past performance to evaluate will be given a neutral rating (Unknown Confidence) IAW FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (iv). The Government reserves the right to obtain information from sources other than the sources identified by the Offeror (e.g., CPARS, PPIRS) and such information will be used for performance risk assessment, responsibility determination, and best value decision. The Government may consider positive and negative information not mentioned by the Offeror, but found during the course of assessing relevant Past Performance.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Past Performance will use the following adjectival ratings to assess confidence:</p>
<p>TABLE 2- PAST PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS</p>
<p>Substantial Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Limited Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>No Confidence - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br /><br />Unknown Confidence - No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br /><br />Basis for Award<br />The Government will award the contract to the Offeror that has (1) submitted all of the materials and information required by the RFP, and otherwise has complied with the RFP instructions, and (2) has the best combination of technical capability, past performance, and price that is most advantageous to the Government.<br />The Government reserves the right to make price/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest of the Government. The Offeror whose price/technical relationship is the most advantageous to the Government will be selected for award amongst all the Offerors. Award may be made without further discussions. Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a technical and price standpoint, which the Offeror can submit to the Government. However, the Government may, after evaluation of proposals, conduct further oral or written discussions as appropriate with all Offerors in the competitive range. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. For evaluation of FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (NOV 1999) the Government will take the sum total of the base period and the four (4) option periods divided by five (5). The solution will then be divided by two (2) in order to reach a six (6) month price that is averaged between all contractual periods. This amount will then be added to the total price for the base period and four (4) options periods to establish a total evaluated price. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>Note to the Proposed Contractor:</p>
<p>The standards of medical practice and duties of the Contractor through its Physician(s) shall be determined pursuant to the bylaws of the Service Unit. The regulations of the hospital, applicable provisions of law, other rules and regulations of any and all governmental authorities relating to licensure and regulation of physicians and hospitals must be followed. Also the standards and recommendations of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) or the Accreditation Organization must be adhered to. The Contract Physician(s) shall be required to participate in a quality improvement program, which is consistent with current requirements for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the quality and appropriateness of care.</p>
<p>Security Clearance</p>
<p>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the IHS (Indian Health Service). Before starting work requiring routine access to IHS facilities or systems each person must complete an FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an IHS employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for IHS processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an IHS site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of IHS sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The IHS utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the eQIP entry to the OPM (Office of Personnel Management) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the Service Unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>OIG Exclusion List</p>
<p>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer. </span></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation&#894; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p><br />This is a firm fixed price acquisition being conducted under FAR part 12 in conjunction with FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (13.106).<br /><br /><br />The Office of Opinion Research (OPN) of the U.S. Department of State (the Client) is considering commissioning a nationally representative public opinion survey in Kenya in 2016 as described below.</p>
<p><br />SUMMARY OF CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>&bull;	Designing an appropriate sample; <br />&bull;	Translating, back-translating, formatting, and printing the questionnaire submitted by the Office of Opinion Research;<br />&bull;	Conducting a pretest;<br />&bull;	Managing fieldwork;<br />&bull;	Coding questionnaires, entering data, checking and cleaning the data; and <br />&bull;	Providing required deliverables: detailed sampling design, translation and back-translation of questionnaire, pretest report, final field version of questionnaire and show cards, marginal frequencies, data in ASCII and SPSS formats, codebook, methodological report, contact sheets for selected interviewers, copies of 10 completed field questionnaires, and additional supporting documentation as necessary.</p>
<p><br />These responsibilities are described in detail below.</p>
<p><br />SAMPLE DESIGN: Design and implement a probability sample design for face-to-face interviews in respondents' homes to achieve a nationally representative sample of at least  1,200 adults age 18 and older, plus an additional boost of 300 adults in the Coast region (for a total of 1,500 interviews).</p>
<p>Before the beginning of fieldwork the Contractor shall submit a spreadsheet or SPSS file showing all of the primary sampling units (PSUs) for each stratum, together with a description of how each unit was selected.  The Contractor shall indicate the skip intervals and random starting points used in the selection process, as well as the order in which the primary sampling units were selected within each stratum.</p>
<p><br />QUESTIONNAIRE:  OPN will provide an English-language questionnaire that will include approximately 45 substantive questions (40 closed-ended, 5 open-ended), focusing on public attitudes toward domestic economic and social issues, as well as international affairs.</p>
<p>In addition, for each respondent the questionnaire and final data set will include:</p>
<p>Demographics: including but not limited to gender, exact age, education, occupation, household income, number of adults in household who are eligible for the survey, economic class, city, region, urban/rural, political party support, religion and ethnicity</p>
<p>Interviewing information: <br />&bull;	date of interview (month, day, day of week);<br />&bull;	interview start time, interview end time, duration of interview in minutes;<br />&bull;	variables used to stratify the sample; a unique code for each primary sampling unit, 	secondary sampling unit, and ultimate sampling point; and a variable indicating the order 	in which the PSUs were selected within each stratum if systematic sampling is used;<br />&bull;	interviewer ID, supervisor ID, field manager ID, data entry/keypuncher ID;<br />&bull;	interviewers' indication of the privacy of the interview and the comfort, comprehension and candor of the respondent;<br />&bull;	whether the respondent is the originally selected respondent or a substitute, the number of visits/call-backs necessary to achieve a successful interview, whether the interview was back-checked, and the method of back-checking (supervisor's presence during the original interview, separate face-to-face interview by either the supervisor or another interviewer, telephone call,  and/or a letter or postcard).</p>
<p><br />TRANSLATION AND BACK-TRANSLATION OF QUESTIONNAIRE:  The Contractor is responsible for translating the questionnaire into colloquial Swahili, Maa, and Somali, and for back-translating the translated questionnaires into English. Additional suggestions for vernacular translations, though not mandatory, would be welcomed. The back-translations must be done by someone who has not seen the original English questionnaire.</p>
<p>The Client will review the translation and consult with the Contractor on necessary changes.  The Client must approve the final translation before the pretest.</p>
<p><br />PRE-TEST:  After the Client approves the translation, the Contractor will pretest the full questionnaire with at least 25 randomly-selected representative interviews that will not be included in the final sample.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide the Client with a pretest report, including a demographic summary of the participants and a discussion by question of any problems or suggested changes to the questionnaire. The Client must approve any changes to the questionnaire.</p>
<p><br />FIELDWORK: Fieldwork will be done by face-to-face interviews in respondents' homes.  All interviews shall be conducted in strict adherence to the sampling plan.  The Contractor is responsible for organizing and overseeing all aspects of fieldwork, including: preparing and printing the final questionnaires; selecting and training interviewers; assigning contact lists to interviewers; supervising interviewers; enforcing quality controls; monitoring and recording contact and non-response rates; and providing weekly feedback to the Office of Opinion Research on the status of fieldwork.</p>
<p>If, in the course of fieldwork, it is apparent that there is an unusually large proportion of persons refusing to be interviewed, the Contractor must inform the Client.</p>
<p>Contact with every sampled household or adult should be attempted at least 3 times during fieldwork. The contact attempts should be spread over different times of the day and days of the week and weekend.</p>
<p>Note: the minimum achieved sample for the survey is 1,500 fully completed interviews.</p>
<p><br />DATA MANAGEMENT:  The Contractor is responsible for processing, cleaning, and coding the data in English,  enforcing quality controls for data entry, and detecting data fabrication, if any.</p>
<p>Closed-end or pre-coded questions:  The Contractor shall use the codes specified on the final questionnaire for all items.</p>
<p>Open-end questions:  The Contractor will develop categories of responses based on 200 randomly selected questionnaires from all regions of the sample, providing at least 5 sample responses for each proposed category.   Categories must be approved by the Client prior to coding responses.</p>
<p>The "Other" category should not include more than 10% of the total responses for any question.  If any single response in the "Other" category amounts to more than 2%, then the Contractor will code this response as a separate response, not as "Other."</p>
<p><br />&emsp;<br />DELIVERABLES: The Contractor shall deliver the following to OPN by email (except as otherwise noted):</p>
<p>1)	Detailed sampling design;</p>
<p>2)	Translation and back-translation of the questionnaire;</p>
<p>3)	Pretest report;</p>
<p>4)	Field versions of the questionnaire and all show cards;</p>
<p>5)	Marginal frequencies (weighted, if appropriate) for all questions, including demographics;</p>
<p>6)	The final, cleaned data files including all survey questions, demographics, interviewing information and (if applicable) weight values; these files shall be in two formats:</p>
<p>a.	ASCII, with all records having the same length<br />b.	SPSS Windows format (*.sav), with all variables and values labeled in English;</p>
<p>7)	A complete codebook for all survey questions, demographics, interviewing information, and (if applicable) weight values, identifying the column positions of all variables in the ASCII file;</p>
<p>8)	A detailed methodological report which contains sufficient details on the sampling design and weighting so that independent researchers would be able to replicate the survey using only information in the report.  In particular, the methodological report  shall include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	A brief report of any unusual problems or significant events which may have influenced the conduct of the survey or the responses given;<br />&bull;	A description of field interviewing, including: exact dates of field work; interviewer selection, training and supervision; and enforcement of quality controls;<br />&bull;	A description of the sampling design and procedure, including:</p>
<p>o	The universe sampled;<br />o	The populations excluded from the sample and why these were excluded;<br />o	Description of statistical documentation used to design the sample (e.g., census data) and date of the information;<br />o	All forms of stratification used, and the basis for stratification; If you use differential probabilities of selection in sampling (e.g., stratification with different rates by strata), provide the justification for using those rates and describe the expected effects on the variances.<br />o	Selection procedure at each stage of sampling: primary sampling unit (PSU), secondary sampling unit (SSU), sampling point, household and individual respondent;<br />o	For PSUs and SSUs, indicate the order in which each unit was selected.  For systematic sampling, indicate the random starting point and the skip interval;</p>

The Library research staff also utilizes these resources in order to respond to requests for peer-reviewed social science literature by the offices of the Chair, Commissioners, Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), Office of General Counsel (OGC) and the Trial Attorneys in the EEOC Field offices. Research requests cover a myriad of subjects, supporting the formulation and execution of Commission policies such as the use of an individual's criminal history in employment selection decisions; task force efforts such as the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing and the Equal Pay Task Force; as well as issues related to cases in litigation.</p>

Interested offerors:

All offerors shall submit one copy of their technical and price quote and return the Price/Cost Schedule (for all line items) electronically to Melissa.Harding2@va.gov.

<p>Sole Source Justification</p>
<p>For Simplified Acquisitions (over $3,000 and up to $150,000) pursuant to FAR 13.106, including Brand Name</p>
<p>SOLICITATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO ONE BRAND ONLY IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT ONLY ONE BRAND NAME IS REASONABLY AVAILABLE. THIS DETERMINATION MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH FULL JUSTIFICATION FOR BRAND NAME FROM THE CUSTOMER. WHEN THE CUSTOMER DESCRIBES AN ITEM WITH A PURCHASE DESCRIPTION WHICH LIMITS THE AVAILABILITY TO ONE BRAND NAME, THE JUSTIFICATION MUST EXPLAIN WHY THE ITEM IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL MEET THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUIREMENT. STATEMENTS SUCH AS "ONLY KNOWN BRAND NAME" OR "ONLY BRAND NAME WHICH CAN MEET THE REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE" ARE INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT A SOLE SOURCE BRAND NAME PURCHASE. THE CUSTOMER SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: <br />PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER<br />21-16-446PCZ421 PROJECT/TASK NUMBER<br />ESTIMATED AMOUNT (Over Micro-Purchase Threshold, but up to the Simplified Acquisition Threshold) <br />BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED, AND THE INTENDED USE:<br />The purchase of OEM replacement circuit cards for the repair of TMR-1096 (part number: 700183-536-001).</p>
<p>UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE BRAND NAME, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER BRAND NAMES OR SOURCES CAN BE USED.<br />The controller card (PN-700183-536-001) is proprietary information for Thales Defense and Security, Inc. (OEM) that is not released to any third party for repair or manufacturing. Thales holds all rights to the TMR-90 designs, drawings, and fabrication and is the only source of supply.</p>
<p>REASON THAT SUGGESTED BRAND NAME IS THE ONLY BRAND NAME WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES<br />In summer 2005, Thales was awarded a $32 million, 10-year IDIQ contract to upgrade all existing Coast Guard Cutters in the legacy fleet. Thales delivered its TMR8090 HF system. This upgrade provided the coast Guard maximum flexibility with the latest integrated and networked shipborne HF technology supporting the newest generation waveforms, including MIL-STD-188-141B Automatic Link Establishment. Thales' modularly designed, dual channel HF radios provide size and weight reductions over legacy equipment and, with a variety of control applications, allow the Coast Guard the ability to remotely control the Thales HF system from the multiple locations, maximizing operational flexibility and reducing workload. In 2008, the Coast Guard selected Thames HF system for incorporation into new cutter acquisition contracts for the next five to seven years. The system is being integrated on the Sentinel-Class fast Response Cutters and Offshore patrol Cutters as well as other cutter and shore communications acquisition programs with medium-powered HE and HE-ALE requirements.</p>
<p><br />EXPLAIN WHY AN ADEQUATE PURCHASE DESCRIPTION OR OTHER INFORMATION SUITABLE TO SOLICIT BY FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE.</p>
<p>Thales is the only HF provider to offer a Near Vertical Incident Skywave solution for the Coast Guard. The controller card (PN-700183-536-001) is proprietary information for Thales that is not released to any third for repair or manufacturing. Thales holds all rights to the TMR-90 designs, drawings, and fabrication and is the only source of supply</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />PROVIDE A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ARE REQUIRED</p>
<p>The government would need to acquire the rights to proprietary chassis components in order to solicit additional competition to reverse engineer or repair to specifications this equipment and its associated components.</p>

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-87 effective 16 March 2016.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Chelton, Inc. as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following parts:</p>

<p>All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Chelton, Inc. (Cage Code 63563). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that Breeze Eastern is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />No alternate part numbers will be accepted. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.</p>

<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>

<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>

All reports of reading and inspections required by the specifications shall be submitted to the COR in writing using a "Condition Found Report (CFR)" form, within 24 hours after the readings and/or inspections are made. <br />Promptness in taking and reporting readings is particularly important for underbody work items such as shaft bearing or rudder bearing clearances.

<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<DESC>Questions &amp; Answers:<br /><br />1.)What is the approved epoxy, and is it required or can we use a multi-flex paint? Which is an elastic water sealer that will seep in and seal the cracks.&nbsp; <strong>Any epoxy that is used for structural concrete repairs. No, a paint is not going to be used to seal a crack.</strong>
<p>2.)Is the kiddie pool part of the contract?&nbsp; <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>3.)Why was the pool half full at time of walk through?&nbsp; <strong>Because CE drained the pool halfway.</strong></p>
<p>4.)Are there any known leaking issues?&nbsp; <strong>Yes.</strong></p>
<p>5.)When was the pool last fully functioning?<strong>&nbsp; It functioned throughout last year's pool season.</strong></p>
<p>6.)When was it last re-plastered?&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>CE states that&nbsp;it was 2009.</strong></p>
<p>7.)Are filter pumps fully functioning and can you verify they are?&nbsp; <strong>They are fully functional.</strong></p>
<p>8.)Is there a pool maintenance log we can see? Any past history of pool performance would be<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>beneficial.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>There is not. CE states that the pool was built in 2004, plastered 2009, and I believe all equipment is original. </strong><br /><br />9.)Do all lights work and can you verify they do? No light replacement was mentioned in SOW.&nbsp; <strong>Lights will not be in the contract.</strong></p>
<p>10.)Are there any known plumbing issues?&nbsp; <strong>Not that we know of.</strong></p>
<p>11.)Can we spray our bond-kote on instead of rolling? We have rolled it on before and it's not rough enough, it should be sprayed on to allow a better adhesion with the new plaster.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Apply to manufacturer specifications.</strong></p>
<p>12.)Does it need to be sealed around the Lights and Drains? A few lights had water in them.&nbsp; <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>13.)At walk through it was stated that the chlorinator supply line saddle would stay as is, and pipe was to be replaced above existing saddle eliminating any concrete demo to remove piping is this correct?&nbsp; <strong>All piping will be replaced, new saddle tap will have to be installed.</strong></p>
<p>14.)SOW only refers to the pool itself with pumps and equipment. The surrounding decking and pool appurtenances are not part of this SOW?&nbsp; <strong>Correct.</strong></p>
<p>15.)There were broken Depth Number Tiles do they need to be replaced? If so can we get pics and/or a total count on tiles to be replaced?&nbsp;<strong> No.</strong></p>
<p>16.)Depth number stickers were torn/damaged. Do these need to be replaced?&nbsp; <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>17.)Existing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Grates for Pool Gutter had a coating that was flaking. Do these get replaced?&nbsp; <strong>No.</strong></p>

<DESC><strong>BBG50-Q-16-00021 IS HEREBY MODIFIED TO POST THE <span style="text-decoration: underline;">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</span>. &nbsp;ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS SOLICITATION SHALL REMAIN THE SAME.</strong><br /><br />Question 1. &nbsp;<br /><br />Has the BBG or any of its agencies, including MBN or      others, contracted for similar research work in the past? &nbsp;If so, can      you please provide the name(s) of the vendor(s)?<br /><br />Answer 1. &nbsp;<br /><br />No, this is a new requirement.<br /><br />Question 2. &nbsp; <br /><br />The section &ldquo;Additional Requirements for Offeror      Proposal&rdquo; on page 5 of the solicitation lists four pricing options (a-d),      each providing the number of monitoring panel participants and duration.      &nbsp;Question: Are we correct to assume that the duration provided for      the monitoring panel should be divided to account for each the two groups?      &nbsp;For instance, a. Option 1 "includes 150 monitoring panel      participants (75 for each round), 6-weeks of monitoring panels&hellip;&rdquo;      &nbsp;Does each panel of 75 last 3 weeks (for a total of 6 weeks)?<br />
<p class="MsoListParagraph">Answer 2. &nbsp;<br /><br />There should be 2 separate groups of participants or &ldquo;rounds&rdquo; for any of the<br />options you propose.&nbsp; If you propose 4 weeks of monitoring panels, each of the<br />2 separate groups would monitor content for 2 weeks. If you propose a 6 week<br />monitoring panel, each of the 2 separate groups would monitor content for 3 weeks. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Question 3. &nbsp;<br /><br />The section &ldquo;Methodology&rdquo; 1.d. states &ldquo;Offeror will be      required to recruit 2 separate panels with <em>separate demographic      profiles"</em>&nbsp;(emphasis added). &nbsp;Question: &nbsp;Can you      clarify what you mean by &ldquo;separate demographic profiles&rdquo;? &nbsp;Does the      BBG want to have different groups with different demographic profiles      participating in each session; or should the panels be recruited in a      similar fashion?<br /><br />Answer 3. &nbsp;<br /><br />This means each group should have different participants with the demographic profiles as indicated in the screening criteria. So yes, the two <em>different</em> panels can be recruited in a similar fashion.<br /><br />Question 4. &nbsp;<br /><br />The section &ldquo;Methodology&rdquo; 2.a. on page 2 states &ldquo;an      interview guide BBG/MBN will provide after contract award.&rdquo; &nbsp;Will the      BBG/MBN also be providing language for the close-end questions for the      questionnaire to be used in the online monitoring panels?<br /><br />Answer 4. <br />&nbsp;<br />Yes.<br /><br />Question 5. <br />&nbsp;<br />For the online monitoring panels, is the BBG/MBN&rsquo;s      intent to have the questionnaire consistent for both panels and throughout      the survey period?<br /><br />Answer 5.<br /> &nbsp;<br />Yes, the Questionnaire will remain the same throughout the research.<br /><br />Question 6. &nbsp;<br /><br />Because this is being issued using simplified      acquisition procedures, is it the BBG/MBN&rsquo;s belief that it can acquire      these services as listed in the four firm-fixed price options for under      $150K, with Option 1 being the biggest panel and longest running, for      under $150K.<br /><br />Answer 6. &nbsp;<br /><br /><a>This requirement is being processed under the Sjmplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).&nbsp;<br /><br />Question 7. &nbsp;<br /><br /></a><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Should all parts of this study include Iraqis?<br /><br />Answer 7. &nbsp;<br /><br /></span>Yes, even though Iraqis were not listed under the screening criteria for monitoring panels. &nbsp;<br /><br />Question 7a. &nbsp;<br /><br />Will we be given all materials for the panels prior to launching them, or will<br />content be changed during the course of the panel? If the latter, how often will<br />content be changed and how much notice will be provided? &nbsp;<br /><br />Answer 7a.<br /> &nbsp;<br />All materials for the first monitoring panel will be provided prior to the launching of the first panel.&nbsp; Materials for the second panel will be provided no longer than 2 weeks after the start of the first monitoring panel. Other than this, content will not be changed during the course of the panels.<br /><br />Question 8.<br /> &nbsp;<br /><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Our understanding of the brief is to start the research with quantitative interviews followed by qualitative in-depths. Given the research needs, quantitative respondents will be recruited </span><em>face to face</em><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;"> and invited to evaluate stimulus &amp; daily surveys sent to them online (via email) for a certain period of time. A handful of respondents will then be handpicked to be interviewed qualitatively. Please let us know you prefer a different quantitative approach here.<br /><br />Answer 8. &nbsp;<br /><br /></span>It is up to the vendor to identify the approach they believe would work best for this project.&nbsp;<br /><br />Question 9. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">The potential countries in question are citizens &amp; residents of Iraq, Morocco, Egypt and KSA. Given the situation in Syria, Syrians can be covered across those four countries where they currently reside. We are still in talks with our field team across these countries to ensure it would be feasible to locate Syrians who are stable enough to have access to the internet.<br /><br />Answer 9. &nbsp;<br /><br /></span>The project requires the inclusion of Syrian participants, be they Syrians in Syria or refugees.<br /><br />Question 10. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Given the sensitivity to news in the region, can you please indicate what topics will be covered in the stimulus/campaigns to be evaluated?<br /><br />Answer 10. &nbsp;<br /><br /></span>Typical news and current events stories widely available on Arab broadcast media.<br /><br />Question 11. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">In the brief, there is mention of 2 &ndash; 4 weeks of fieldwork as well as 4 &ndash; 6 weeks of fieldwork. Can you please advise the basis on which this is suggested? Is it the number of campaigns/stimuli in question? And which duration are you most interested in?<br /><br />Answer 11. &nbsp;<br /><br /></span>Our preferred duration will depend on the cost, but the minimum we will accept for each panel is 2 weeks (for a minimum of 4 weeks).<br /><br />Question 12.<br /> &nbsp;<br /><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">We are requested to recruit 2 separate panels with different demographic profiles:&nbsp;</span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Are you looking to test different campaigns/stimuli in each panel? <br /><br />Answer 12. &nbsp;<br /><br />Yes<br /><br /></span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Question 12a. &nbsp;<br /><br />Can we assume that the total sample size will be split between the two panels? <br /><br />Answer 12a. &nbsp;<br /><br />Yes<br /><br />Question 12b. &nbsp;<br /><br /></span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Is each panel expected to commit to the surveys for 2 &ndash; 3 weeks (5 days/week)? <br /><br />Answer 12b. &nbsp;<br /><br />Yes<br /><br />Question 13. &nbsp;<br /><br /></span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Based on our experience, this region is challenging when it comes to committing to daily interviews over a long period due to short attention spans and overall willingness to commit. They could also show more reluctance when it comes to answering questions about news. We would therefore suggest each respondents commits to this for a period of 5 days only and test one stimulus/survey a day. Is this an approach you&rsquo;re open to work with? If so, please advise if campaigns/surveys can be reduced to 5 instead?<br /><br />Answer 13. &nbsp;<br /><br /></span>Each panel should last a minimum of 2 weeks (10 days) as indicated in the SOW.&nbsp; It is up to the vendor to ensure participants remain committed to the exercise and over-recruit where necessary to compensate for drop outs.<br /><br />Question 14. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Will the links to the stimuli direct them to Facebook or are you happy for us to embed the stimuli/videos within our online surveys?<br /><br />Answer 14. &nbsp;<br /><br /></span>Either option<br /><br />Question 15. &nbsp;<br /><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">Should the quantitative phase be deemed unfeasible, would you be happy for us to suggest a qualitative approach only? We can always have respondents evaluate stimulus before each interview.</span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph">Answer 15. &nbsp;<br /><br />No<br /><br />Question 16. &nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">We understand you require daily email summaries of the main findings of the previous day&rsquo;s surveys + a written analytical report (10 -15 pages) for options 1 &amp; 2. With regards to the analytical report, please confirm that this is expected at the end of research as the final </span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in; text-decoration: underline;">quantitative </span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">deliverable. Also, can we assume the report would only cover a summary of each campaign&rsquo;s performance?<br /><br />Answer 16. &nbsp;<br /><br /></span>As indicated in the SOW, the final analytic report should detail the findings from the in-depth interviews as well as incorporating insights from panel exercises.&nbsp; Vendor is expected to deliver an SPSS file with the data from the online panels.<br /><br /><strong>END OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ID/IQ Contract Quantity Limits</p>
<p>1. Minimum Guaranteed Amount</p>

<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>(a) In accordance with Section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113-235), Government agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.</p>
<p>(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information.</p>
<p>(c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>DOL 2012-01 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST CLAUSE - OCI-1 EXCLUSION FROM FUTURE AGENCY CONTRACTS (DECEMBER 2012)<br /><br />This clause supplements the FAR provisions on organizational conflicts of interest, located at FAR subpart 9.500 and should be read in conjunction with these provisions. To the extent there is any inconsistency or confusion between the two provisions, the FAR provision controls.</p>
<p>(a) Work under this contract may create a future organizational conflict of interest (OCI) that could prohibit the Contractor from competing for, or being awarded, future Government contracts.</p>
<p>The following examples illustrate situations in which organizational conflicts of interest may arise. They are not all inclusive, but will be used by the Contracting Officer as general guidance in individual contract situations:</p>
<p>(1) Unequal Access to Information. The performance of this contract may provide access to "nonpublic information," which could provide the contractor an unfair competitive advantage in later solicitations or competitions for other DOL contracts. Such an advantage could be perceived as unfair by a competing vendor who is not given similar access to the same nonpublic information that is related to the future procurement action. If you, as a contractor, in performing this contract, obtain nonpublic information that is relevant to a future procurement action, you may be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan prior to being deemed eligible to compete on the future action. Alternatively, the "nonpublic information" may be provided to all offerors.</p>
<p>(2) Biased Ground Rules. Your contract with DOL may have, in some fashion, established important "ground rules" for another DOL procurement in which you may desire to be a competitor. For example, this contract may involve you drafting the statement of work, specifications, or evaluation criteria for a future DOL procurement. The primary concern, in any such situation, is that any such firm could skew the competition, whether intentionally or not, or be perceived as having skewed the competition, in its own favor. If the requirements of this DOL contract anticipate the contractor may be placed in a position to establish important ground rules, including but not limited to those described herein, the contractor may be precluded from competing in the related action or, if possible, may be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan.</p>
<p>(3) Impaired Objectivity. The performance of this contract may result in the contractor being placed in a situation where it is able, or required, to provide assessment and evaluation findings concerning itself, another business division, a subsidiary or affiliate, or other entity with which it has a significant financial relationship. The concern in this case is that the contractor's ability to render impartial advice to DOL could appear to be undermined by the contractor's financial or other business relationship to the entity whose work product is being assessed or evaluated. In these situations, a "walling off" of lines of communication between entities or divisions may be acceptable, but it also may not be sufficient to remove the perception that the objectivity of the contractor has been tainted. If the requirements of the DOL procurement indicate that a contractor may be placed in a position to provide evaluations and assessments of itself or other entities with which it has a significant financial relationship, the affected contractor should notify DOL immediately. The contractor may also be required to provide a mitigation plan that includes recusal by the contractor from one of the affected contracts. Such recusal might include divestiture of the work to a third party.</p>
<p>(b) In order to prevent a future OCI of any kind, the Contractor shall be subject to the following restrictions:</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor may be excluded from competition for, or award of, any government contracts as to which, in the course of performing another contract, the Contractor has received nonpublic and competitively relevant information before such information has been made generally available to other persons or firms.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor may be excluded from competition for, or award of, any government contract for which the contractor actually assisted or participated in the development of specifications or statements of work.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor may be excluded from competition for or award of, any government contract which calls for it to evaluate itself, any affiliate, or any products or services produced or performed thereby.</p>
<p>(4) The Contractor may be excluded from competition for, or award of, any government contract calling for the production or performance of any product or service for which the Contractor participated in the development of requirements or definitions pursuant to another contract.</p>
<p>(c) This clause shall not exclude the Contractor from performing work under any modification to this contract or from competing for award of any future contract for work that is the same or similar to work performed under this contract, so long as the conditions above are not present. This clause does not prohibit an incumbent from competing on a follow-on competition but the Contracting Officer may require a mitigation plan or other steps as needed to ensure that there has not been an unequal access to nonpublic competitively sensitive information.</p>
<p>(d) The term "contractor" as used in this clause, includes any person, firm or corporation that owns or controls, or is owned or controlled by, the contractor. The term also includes the corporate officers of the contractor.</p>
<p>(e) The agency may in its sole discretion, waive any provisions of this clause if deemed in the best interest of the Government. The exclusions contained in this clause shall apply for the duration of this contract and for three (3) years after completion and acceptance of all work performed hereunder, or such other period as the Contracting Officer shall direct.</p>
<p>(f) If any provision of this clause excludes the Contractor from competition for, or award of any contract, the Contractor shall not be permitted to serve as a subcontractor, at any tier, on such contract. This clause shall be incorporated into any subcontracts or consultant agreements awarded under this contract unless the Contracting Officer determines otherwise.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>

The contractor shall ensure that its system and components allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access and use of information and data that is comparable to the access afforded Federal employees and members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. The term electronic and information technology includes, but is not limited to, computers, printers, software applications, telecommunications products (such as telephones), information kiosks and transaction machines, Internet/Intranet sites, multimedia, and office equipment such as copiers and fax machines. For all EIT procured, maintained, developed or used at DOL to include electronic documents, software, websites and webpages created or maintained by the Contractor, in order to meet Section 508 accessibility requirements, the Contractor shall: <br />1. Provide summary narrative text descriptions or a data tables describing each complex graphic (e.g., pie graphs, line graphs, maps, bar graphs, flow charts) in a separate comma-separated values/character separated values (CSV) file. <br />2. Label each figure or graphic image with an alternate text description.<br />3. Contracted vendor support staffs producing EIT deliverables must have a working knowledge of Section 508 and performing Quality Assurance Testing for Section 508; must include this information for the individuals proposed on the contract.<br />4. Contractors are responsible for having updated authoring and testing tools to produce Section 508 output on their own; the Government will not provide these tools.<br />5. Unless otherwise stated in the specification of the Contract, two digital copies of any report over 25 pages shall be delivered in media formats readable by Windows-based programs; one copy shall be formatted in Microsoft Word and the second shall be in the Portable Document Format (PDF). Color and/or black white PDFs are acceptable. Unless permitted by the specifications, reports shall not be submitted in HTML format.<br />Additional information about accessibility standards related to Section 508 may be found at http://section508.gov/.

Submit more than one attachment, as subsequent attachments will not be recognized.<br />d. Submit more than one invoice in a single attachment.<br />e. Attempt to use the "Recall or Resend" email message feature.<br />(d) General Information. Payment due dates will be calculated only from the date that invoices are received in the electronic invoicing e-mail box and determined to be proper invoices. Inquiries regarding invoices should be e-mailed to MSHAInvoiceInquires@dol.gov. The relevant invoice must be attached to the inquiry e-mail and the subject line of the e-mail must state "INQUIRY," followed by the information described in paragraph (1) d above. Example: INQUIRY: &lt;Contractor Name&gt;, MSHA, &lt;Contract Number, BPA Call or Order Number&gt;, Invoice Number, &lt;Invoice Amount&gt;. Do NOT use the electronic invoicing e-mail address for inquiries about the invoice.<br />(e) Invoice requirements. Invoices shall comply with FAR 32.905.<br />(f) Exceptions. Paper invoices should only be faxed or mailed through U.S. mail when electronic mail cannot be accomplished.<br />When invoices must be faxed due to e-mail size limitations, fax them to: MSHA Finance at 303-231-5597<br />When paper invoices must be mailed due to e-mail size limitations, mail them to the following address: MSHA Finance, PO Box 25367, DFC, Denver, CO 80225-0367</p>

<p>4.	POSITION TITLE: Office Support Team Leader</p>
<p>5.	MARKET VALUE: This position has been designated as a "tandem/ladder" position that, depending on the qualifications of the candidate, can be filled at either the GS-12 ($77,490 - $100,736 per annum) or GS-13 ($92,145 - $119,794 per annum) equivalent level. The highest level of this position is a GS-13.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a key member of the OTI Operations and Management Division, the Office Support Team Leader is directly responsible for the overall management, coordination, and evaluation of administrative and/or program services in support of OTI program-funded staff in Washington and the field. The Office Support Team Leader will be expected to coordinate a myriad of administrative management tasks including space coordination, unit security, emergency preparedness and administrative management services compliance.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The IT Team is a member of OTI's Operations and Management Division which prides itself on maintaining positive morale in the division and a high degree of customer support and innovation for the office.  OTI is under USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).</p>
<p>The IT Team supports OTI program staff and operations by ensuring the development and maintenance of OTI IT applications (web and non-web-based) that support the management of OTI programs.  The IT team liaises with USAID's Chief Information Office (CIO) on IT support and security requirements, manages OTI's mobile devices in collaboration with USAID/CIO, manages OTI's IT budget and inventory, and collaborates closely with OTI's two other divisions:  Programs, Learning and Innovations (PLI) and Field Programs Division (FPD).</p>
<p>The IT Team Leader supervises several US Personal Service Contract staff and works closely with a small team of institutional contract staff. Members of the IT Team work in a fast-paced environment and support the full IT development life cycle.  The team has daily interaction with both U.S. and international users, and gains a wealth of experience learning to implement or backstop all of the various facets of a small-scale yet modern web application as well as providing other IT support for a unique, rapid response office in USAID. OTI's portfolio of applications manages DC-based operations as well as grants under contract programs implemented throughout the world in support of USAID's mission, containing a robust geospatial element.</p>
<p>More information about OTI can be found on the web here and here.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>Solicitation Number: FA8617-15-R-6199 15 July 2015</p>
<p>The purpose of this SSS Amendment is to provide Industry a REVISED PWS due to significant changes of requirements. The original SSS posted on 26 May 2015 remains applicable.</p>
<p>1. This SSS amendment and the attached revised Performance Work Statement (PWS) describe an acquisition strategy for an anticipated CLS/Maintenance Training program for the Afghan Trainer Program in Afghanistan. Vendors are encouraged to carefully review the entire PWS as there are multiple changes made throughout the PWS. The changes are too numerous to specify individually. Industry is encouraged to carefully review the revised PWS in its entirety.</p>
<p>2. PoP revised as follows:</p>
<p>This CLS/Maintenance Training contract will consist of the following Period of Performance (PoP) of one (1) 12 month base with four (4) x one (1)/year Options:</p>
<p>&bull;&middot; Base: 01 Jul 2016 -30 Jun 2017</p>
<p>&bull;&middot; Option 1: 01 Jul 2017 -30 Jun 2018</p>
<p>&bull;&middot; Option 2: 01 Jul 2018 -30 Jun 2019</p>
<p>&bull;&middot; Option 3: 01 Jul 2019 -30 Jun 2020</p>
<p>&bull;&middot; Option 4: 01 Jul 2020 -30 Jun 2021</p>
<p>3. Capability Survey Questions - Industry should respond to the additional questions listed below. Industry need not respond to the original questions in the original SSS posted on 26 May 2015.</p>
<p>1. There will be contract CLINs for transferring 2, 4, and/or 6 aircraft per year to AAF responsibility. Describe your approach for supporting the drawdown of USG aircraft support if any of these CLINs are exercised. See PWS paragraph 1.2.1.</p>
<p>2. Describe your approach to measure On-The-Job (OJT) training to prepare AAF students for the next level of instruction.</p>
<p>3. Describe your concept to flexibility for supporting 40 hours/aircraft/month during fighting season, 20 hours/aircraft/month during non-fighting season with 25% surge capability along with supporting AAF responsible aircraft maintenance, supplemental training and contingency operations. See PWS paragraph 1.2.2.</p>
<p>4. Describe your approach to performing maintenance of AAF responsible aircraft IAW PWS paragraph 3.2.4.</p>
<p>5. Remobilization. Since Afghanistan is an unstable environment there is the possibility that the contractor would have to relocate to another base during the contract period. The contractor can assume that the same level of government furnished services/supplies will be at the new location. Please provide your concerns, if any, to the following scenarios for relocating from Kandahar to another coalition base in a region.</p>
<p>Scenario #1: All nine (9) C208B aircraft located at Kandahar will move to the new base, along with tools, support equipment, and contractor personnel.</p>
<p>Scenario #2: All nine (9) C208B aircraft located at Kandahar will remain and transition to "AAF responsible" aircraft. The contractor will provide tools and support equipment for purchase by the USG to provide to the AAF for support of the 9 aircraft. The contractor will adjust the number of FAA Airframe &amp; Power plant certified mechanics appropriately to service the smaller fleet size of USG responsible aircraft while retaining the capability to support any requests for the increased size of the AAF responsible fleet. The contractor personnel will move to the new base.</p>
<p>6. Training: Describe your experience with performing aircraft maintenance training of Middle Eastern country personnel in their host country?</p>
<p>4. Additional Information</p>

GENERAL INTENT<br />a. Background<br />The Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate Battlespace Environment Center (AFRL/RVBY) would like to investigate scientific solutions to Nuclear Explosion Monitoring (NEM) problems with improving regional and local seismic discrimination and yield estimation, improving structural models of the earth for seismic attenuation &amp; velocity and for full seismic waveform modeling, improving methods of collecting location and discrimination ground truth for seismic events, improving seismic signal processing for seismic detection, signal association, location and discrimination, and understanding seismic source physics of explosions and other events such as earthquakes that may improve seismic discrimination. Such solutions would require scientific studies of the type published in scientific journals with presentation at scientific meetings and peer review throughout the process.</p>
<p>b. Approach</p>
<p>The primary goal of this RFI is to obtain information on potential scientific solutions for these challenges.</p>
<p>c. Description</p>
<p>Government Objective: AFRL/RVBY requests brief summaries of potential scientific solutions for problems in seismic source physics, discrimination and yield estimation, earth models of attenuation, velocity and full waveforms, ground truth for discrimination and location, and data processing. For each of these categories, possible examples of scientific solutions follow. Summaries of scientific solutions are welcomed on these or in other research directions.</p>
<p>Seismic Source Physics: Generally, new ways to improve predictions of source generation of seismic signals, from all shallow source types, that may be used for discrimination and/or yield estimation. Ways to improve physical understanding of the dependence of seismic source generation on explosion emplacement conditions (depth, scaled depth, decoupling, material properties, pre-stress, and local structure/topography), especially for small shallow seismic events. Hypothesis tests of proposed mechanisms for anomalous waveform characteristics, e.g. larger surface waves than predicted for explosions. Distinguishing between feasible source mechanisms. Methods of determining depth to within 10s of meters for shallow and very shallow events. Partitioning of energy into P, S, and surface waves, understanding of the higher frequencies that may be critical for local discrimination, and methods that can discriminate chemical from nuclear explosions. Summaries may include one or multiple approaches, and may include analysis of existing nuclear and chemical explosion records, theoretical investigations, and/or numerical simulations.</p>
<p>Discrimination and Yield Estimation: New discriminants that take advantage of the characteristics of small locally (200 km or less) recorded events or of local propagation effects. Assessment of extensions of successful regional discriminants to local distances: what conditions affect the performance at local distances does this work or not work. Rigorous assessments of local discriminant performance and uncertainty, and of the physical bases for their success or failure. Ways to provide new understanding of the properties of small seismic events and their seismic waveforms at local and regional (2,000 km or less) distances. Ways to improve the accuracy of existing discriminants and estimates of their uncertainty or that develop new discriminants that have a firm physical and statistical basis. Methods for estimating yield of seismic events recorded at local distances with low uncertainty. At regional distances, improving event characterization of smaller events as well as improving understanding of uncertainties. Methods to improve the accuracy of source characterization by moment tensors and their uncertainties, and new understanding of their limitations, especially for smaller events recorded at higher frequencies (e.g. 10-20 seconds period).</p>
<p>Attenuation and Full Waveform Earth Models: Ways to improve the prediction of waveforms and amplitudes at local and regional distances. In particular, local/regional attenuation and scattering models, with emphasis on their ability to match observed amplitudes of Pn, Pg, Sn, and Lg phases, their codas, and surface waves; assessment of the extent and effects of censoring and application of appropriate methods to address censoring; new methods for measuring attenuation; models that fit multiple datasets (e.g. body wave and surface wave amplitudes), if the potential to improve predictions that affect discrimination can be shown; and methods that utilize full waveforms and finite-frequency methods. Methods that account for 3D structural effects on amplitudes. In all cases, a robust estimate of uncertainty is an important consideration (confidence, resolution, and variance).</p>
<p>Velocity Earth Models: Ways to develop advanced models of the Earth's velocity structure that will improve location capability. In particular, (1) P-wave velocity structure studies and studies of poorly calibrated regions within Eurasia; (2) new techniques of determining 3-D, spatially variable velocity models; (3) new techniques for building models by fitting multiple datasets, especially of different types of data, if the potential to improve predictions that affect location can be shown; (4) techniques to estimate the uncertainty in geophysical models and assess the tradeoffs between different parameters of the models, as well as the uncertainty (confidence, resolution, and variance) in predicted observables, such as travel times; (5) new techniques for determining velocity structure in aseismic regions; (6) studies that compare different methods to show their strengths and weaknesses; and models that can predict structural effects on seismic amplitudes at 1 Hz and higher as well as travel times. Solutions utilizing full waveforms and finite-frequency methods. Techniques for accurately predicting P-wave travel times from surface wave based models.</p>
<p>Location and Discrimination Ground Truth: Solutions to improve the collection of calibration events at a GT5 level (absolute location and depth errors less than 5 kilometers) or better in uncalibrated or very poorly calibrated areas. Studies that generate new discrimination calibration events, along with source geometry and other characterizing information. Accurate estimates of depth and origin time and their uncertainties are potentially important for location calibration events. Improved techniques for event location using models and/or ground truth at local, regional or near-teleseismic distances, particularly methods that use more than a single type of data jointly. Robust estimation of uncertainty is an important consideration.</p>
<p>Data Processing: New and innovative signal processing methods for data from local (less than 200 km) and regional (less than 2,000 km) distances that significantly lower the thresholds at which detection, location and identification functions can be performed at an acceptable false alarm rate. Extension of existing state-of-the art single station and array methods to networks to reduce detection, location and identification thresholds. Ways to increase the efficiency of the real-time automated process of constructing thousands of unique seismic events to low thresholds from millions of detections on hundreds of seismic sensors, combining local, regional, and teleseismic seismic signals. Ways to enable the incorporation of orders of magnitude larger seismic networks and seismic data streams, including rapidly changing networks. In particular, ways to reduce the computational burdens of global signal association for event construction for such systems. Solutions that are tuning studies, either of specific arrays or of techniques in general, are not scientific in nature.</p>
<p>These options are presented to allow responders to assess potential approaches and scientific risks and costs.</p>
<p>d. Response</p>
<p>Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead and include the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Potential solution to meet one of the Government objectives;<br />(2) Scientific plan of study;<br />(3) Time phased research plan (schedule);<br />(4) Rough order of magnitude cost estimate correlated to schedule;<br />(5) Premises and assumptions; and<br />(6) Risk assessment.</p>

<p><br />AEDC has the need to procure medium voltage switchgear that is reliable and safe. Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) is the latest technology that provides power without requiring personnel to be equipped with arc flash personal protective equipment (PPE) while operating or maintaining the GIS equipment. Hours of industry wide research, competitive bidding, and accepted maintenance and reliability practice have resulted in the conclusion that Siemens Type 8DA10 Gas Insulated Switchgear is the only switchgear that confines each of the three phases of power in three separate compartments. This is a critical requirement from a safety standpoint and mitigates electrical fault severity to avoid costly shutdowns of the entire system. With the isolation of the phases a factory-trained Siemens employee can remove the damaged phase and replace it with the identical part from a spare cubicle, and return the cubicle to service in a short amount of time. In most cases this work can be completed with the remainder of the switchgear lineup still in service. If spares are available, a new enclosure could be installed from the spare cubicle but the entire lineup would be unavailable throughout the duration of the repair.</p>

Accordingly,&nbsp;"USAICoE INDUSTRY DAY" section updated below.<br /><br />ORIGINAL 22 December 2015:<br /><br />DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Army Contracting Command - Orlando (ACC-ORL) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) in support of U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (USAICoE) requirements. This acquisition will be referred to as the Huachuca Training and Support Contract (HTASC). This SSN is associated with Special Notice and Request for Information (RFI) listed under solicitation number W900KKHTASC.</p>
<p>Potential NAICS for HTASC: 611430 Professional and Management Development Training. 611699 All Other Miscellaneous Schools and Instruction.</p>
<p>Based on the requirements, the Government is considering a single award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Government has provided a DRAFT HTASC "common"/basic Performance Work Statement (PWS, Attachment 01 to this SSN) along with several additional DRAFT PWSs that may be Task Orders under the HTASC single award IDIQ contract if this was determined to be the best acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information regarding relevant experience and capabilities of industry partners interested in performing this potential requirement. Responses to this SSN will be used to gain insight from industry's experience performing similar requirements and to analyze the information in order to develop a contract vehicle (or multiple contract vehicles) capable of supporting the described mission. Based on this assessment, the Government will finalize an acquisition strategy to generate a formal draft solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government encourages industry to provide comments and suggestions relating to acquisition strategy to include: NAICS, contract type, contract structure, teaming arrangements, small business participation/set asides, etc.</p>
<p>The Government also encourages industry to provide questions, comments, and suggestions relating to the Performance Work Statements (PWSs) provided. Questions received will be consolidated, answered and, if deemed valuable information for all interested parties, will be posted at a later date on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. The Government will not disclose the identity of the potential offeror asking the questions.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>USAICoE's training requirements were previously supported by Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) through the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) contract and the Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract. The majority of USAICoE's Warfighter FOCUS (WFF) requirements will be supported by the new HTASC.</p>
<p>NOTE: Some of USAICoE's WFF/SETA requirements (previously discussed under the Special Notice/RFI for HTASC) will be supported by other contract vehicles (to be announced through separate FBO announcements) allowing the Government to focus HTASC's scope on USAICoE's core mission: Military Intelligence training. Requirements anticipated to be outside of HTASC include:</p>
<p>- USAICoE Chief Information Office (CIO) - G6;<br />- Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) - Solicitation Number W900KK-16-R-0024; and<br />- Knowledge Based Assistance and Advisory Services to include: USAICoE Knowledge Management Office; USAICoE Reserve Forces Office (RFO); USAICoE Safety requirement; and USAICoE Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC).</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>Please submit all responses (and any other written correspondence) to the following email inbox (the size limitation is 20MB) with email Subject: "HTASC Sources Sought Notice Response". <br /><br />usarmy.orlando.peo-stri.mbx.htasc@mail.mil</p>

<p>Please mark submitted proprietary information/data accordingly.</p>
<p>Cover page shall include:</p>
<p>Contractor name, address, point of contact information, DUNS, CAGE, and small business information, if applicable (including reference to above listed NAICS).</p>

<p>- 20 pages or less (not including cover page);<br />- Arial, font size 12, (graphics can utilize smaller/different font); <br />- 1 inch margins; and<br />- organized into three distinct sections:</p>
<p>Section I. Describe your firm's applicable capabilities related to the enclosed PWSs and related past performance (to include contract name/number, customer name/contract information, period of performance, and a brief description of the related services). Past performance should be recent (meaning contract is ongoing, or, if the contract has ended, the contract end date shall be no more than three years prior to this SSN posting date). Firms can provide verbatim language from the HTASC RFI #1 submission as needed.</p>
<p>Section II. The Government encourages industry to provide comments and suggestions relating to acquisition strategy to include: NAICS, contract type, contract structure, teaming arrangements, small business participation/set asides, etc. Describe your firm's perspective on effective strategies for satisfying this requirement, focusing on real-world and/or conceptual solutions and relevant lessons learned that address the Government's HTASC requirements. Please provide any realized or theoretical earned value (e.g. cost, schedule, performance) that may be derived from the strategy/strategies. Describe the basis behind the recommendation and the expected outcomes. Outcomes should be rationalized and articulated in terms of the costs and benefits to the Government.</p>
<p>Section III. Please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. The Government may narrow the HTASC scope to strictly instructors and training development requirements to allow a) industry to focus on USAICoE's core mission, Military Intelligence training, and b) provide more competitive opportunities to industry to support the other training support/professional services USAICoE requirements (to include, but not limited to, advisory/assistance services, USAICoE Reserve Forces Office (RFO) support, Safety requirement support, and Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) support as described in the HTASC RFI #1). What is your firm's perspective regarding this acquisition strategy?</p>
<p>2. Is it your firm's intention to support HTASC as a prime contractor? If so, which requirements/tasks would your firm intend on supporting through subcontracts (if your firm is identified as a small business under one of the identified NAICS, please consider FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting)?</p>
<p>3. What would your firm consider an appropriate length of time for transition from the incumbent contract to the HTASC contract?</p>
<p>4. In general, are there specific portions of the Government's DRAFT requirements documentation that your firm feels need to be defined more clearly?</p>
<p>5. Do you feel the requirements are defined enough to allow for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract, or, some FFP line items for specific tasks?</p>

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>or around 4-12-16.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Small Business size standard is <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>500employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a QPL, qualified products list item. All offers must being providing a currently approved QPL source of supply for the end item material.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies. The Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Approved sources are: GEMS SENSORS cage<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>04034 <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>and MADISON ELECTRIC cage 21603.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>

This Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. The GSA is performing market research in order to determine the availability of firms which possess the capability and experience to execute all of the requirements described herein. This announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from firms with demonstrated experience and performance at the prime contractor level, and (2) to gauge the capability of those interested firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level. <br />No proposals are being requested or accepted in response to this RFI. This announcement does not obligate the Government to award a contract, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any preparation costs. <br />Requirement:<br />The anticipated formal solicitation is for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contract with a maximum value of $850M, over a five year ordering period. It is envisioned that the contract type(s) will be time and material (T&amp;M), labor hour, firm fixed price, and cost plus fixed fee. We anticipate awarding to no more than three firms.  There will be very discerning and difficult evaluation criteria which will include but will not be limited to direct, recent or current experience in the functional areas including working with the mission partners on similar QRC C4&amp;ISR efforts. This RFI/Sources Sought is NOT a request for proposals, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. We invite any size business concerns with the required experience to provide a capability statement in response to this RFI/Sources Sought. <br />There is a need to acquire specialized contractor support with demonstrated Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) to respond to programmatic, engineering, and security needs in an increasingly joint environment to support the mission of the Remote Sensing and Command, Control, Communications &amp; Computer Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (RS&amp;C4ISR) community.  The Department of Defense's (DoD) Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) needs span across Technical Evaluation, Demonstration and Assessment, System Engineering, Information Assurance, Cyber Operations, DoD Infrastructure, manned and unmanned systems, Maritime Domain Awareness, remote sensing, training, Human Systems Integration, Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Electronic Warfare (EW) and Information Operations (IO), Modeling, Simulation, and Foreign Comparative Testing.  <br />The Scope of the IDIQ is to support development of Quick Reaction Capabilities (QRC) through streamlined acquisition processes, demonstrations, user Concept of Operations (CONOPS), technical assessments, and new system development that will support near-term and long term operational requirements within the National, DoD, and Intelligence Communities as well as non-DoD agencies such as the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of the Treasury (DOT), Department of the Interior (DOI), and the Department of State (DOS). The Contractor will be expected to provide qualified personnel capable of performing highly technical, cutting-edge military research and development efforts as well as programmatic oversight services.
<p>Worldwide services are required. The services to be procured are non-personal and are not inherently Government functions. Activities to be performed include the performance of tasks and completion of products/deliverables for eight ISR functional categories that support all segments of the project/system/enterprise life-cycle process. Specific requirements will be tailored to the specific focus and requirements of that functional category.  The eight functional areas are: Technical Collection and Analysis, Manned and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I), and Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E),Studies, Modeling and Simulation, and Technical Support,  Forensics, Biometrics, and Signature Support,Cyber Technologies, Cyber Operations, Information Operations, Data, and C4 Knowledge Management, Logistics, Training, and Infrastructure Services Support. These functional areas are described in more detail the Attachment 1.<br />The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for these requirements is 541712. The business size standard for this NAICS is 1000 employees. Your response should identify your business size (large or small) in relation to this NAICS Code.</p>
<p>Security Requirements:<br />Personnel may be assigned to SCI facilities and must possess a minimum of a Top Secret Security Clearance, based on a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or Periodic Review (PR) for Top Secret.  Investigations will be completed within at least five years to allow for access to Top Secret level and for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and/or Special Access Program (SAP).  All technical documentation and data exchanged between the contractor and the Government shall be protected from public disclosure in accordance with the markings contained thereon (i.e., classified in accordance with appropriate DOD approved security classification directives and guides).<br />National Agency Checks (NACs) will be conducted, at a minimum, for all personnel in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R.  The contractor shall establish and administer personnel and physical security programs in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R and RAFI 31-101, Installation Security. The contractor shall be responsible for safeguarding all Government property provided for contractor use.  This contract requires that personnel have access to Privacy Information.  Personnel shall adhere to the Privacy Act, Title 5 of the U.S. Code, Section 552a and applicable agency rules and regulations.<br /> <br />Capabilities: <br />GSA is seeking Prime Contractors capable of performing in all eight functional areas, independently or through the use of Subcontractors and/or partners.  Interested firms must demonstrate QRC experience. Interested firms must have experience as a multiple award IDIQ holder. Interested firms must meet the Security Requirements.  Interested firms shall possess and demonstrate an in-depth understanding and experience in all eight functional areas described in the attachment.  <br /> Capability and Information Statement<br />The Government is requesting interested sources to provide sufficient information that demonstrates recent experience (within the last three (3) years) in providing the broad range of capabilities described above and in the Attachment to this RFI. Interested sources are requested to submit a brief Summary of Demonstrated Capabilities (no more than 20 pages) that addresses each of the functional areas listed in the attachment.  The response shall include previous scenarios, examples of past projects and deliverables that demonstrate experience and success in each of the functional areas. If a particular functional area falls outside of previous experience, please acknowledge that area as being new and describe how it would be approached.  In addition to providing a response for each functional area, interested sources must also address the following Market Survey Questionnaire:<br />Responses to this notice shall include the following administrative data:<br />1. Company name, address, contacts, phone number, e-mail address, and CAGE code.<br />2. Notification of interest in proposing as a prime contractor, subcontractor, or both.</p>
<p>3. Company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history for last 3 years, office locations, DUNS number, company size (small or large) in relation to the proposed NAICS, etc. Identification of small business type (i.e., SDB, SDVOSB, 8(a), etc.)</p>
<p>5. E-mail should include the following subject line: Company Name--Capability Statement for RS&amp;C4ISR</p>
<p>Interested companies should include in their response answers to the following questions/requests:<br />1. Address your organization's capability to manage a broad IDIQ contract covering a range of functional areas and technology disciplines and interdisciplinary work. A strong, efficient management approach is of the utmost importance when serving as the prime contractor on a task order IDIQ contract.<br />2. Core Competencies for Quick Reaction Capability (QRC). Briefly describe your company's demonstrated core competencies and/or specialized personnel in the realm of QRC and Remote Sensing and Command, Control, Communications &amp; Computer Intelligence Surveillance.<br />3.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award sole source contracts to state agencies to conduct inspections of animal producers and associated firms to investigate drug residues in animal tissues and to determine compliance with 21 CFR589.2000, "BSE RULE". This program meets the criteria set forth in 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statue.

The period of performance of this requirement allows for a base year and one (1) option year. Contractors must meet the following special requirements: (1) possess legal authority under state law necessary to gain access to any regulated private commercial establishment for the unique purpose of conducting regulatory inspections and investigations to determine compliance with the animal drug and feed provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act at any geographical location within the state; (2) have trained personnel experienced with the inspectional procedures and evidence development techniques necessary to assess the conformance of an establishment with the federal law and regulations or comparable state requirements; and (3) demonstrate experience with state regulatory or voluntary procedures for corrective violative practices. Only governmental organizations have the unique qualifications and authority to perform this kind of activity. This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with state organizations under the authority of FAR 6.302-5. This notice is issued for informational purposes and not a request for competitive proposals.

<p>The NAICS code for this project is 621999. The small business size standard is $15M.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Contact Center, also known as NCI's Cancer Information Service (CIS), was established in 1975 and is a federally funded program that is an essential part of NCI's cancer education and information efforts. The first call the Contact Center took was in early 1976.   This project is for the re-competition of contract HHSN261201000004C with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Prior to the current contract, NCI's CIS Contact Center operated concurrently through 4   competitively awarded five-year contracts. This Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of NCI.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this support is to provide scientifically based, unbiased information to patients, their families and friends, physicians and other health professionals, and the general public about all aspects of cancer including: cancer research and clinical trials, cancer prevention, risk factors, symptoms, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, living with cancer, and tobacco and cessation counseling and information.</p>
<p>The NCI Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) coordinates and manages the Institute's interaction with the public (including patients, friends and family), researchers, and the media.  OCPL informs the public and the media about the Institute's research activities and scientific advances.  OCPL also works closely with NCI scientists and partner organizations to design and develop effective methods to reach diverse audiences and to meet their needs for the latest, evidence-based cancer information.</p>
<p>The NCI's CIS is an important component of the agency's communications enterprise and supports the NCI mission in numerous ways.  The NCI Contact Center:</p>
<p>&bull;	Serves as the voice of the NCI to the public<br />&bull;	Supports clinical trials recruitment and NCI's clinical trials initiatives<br />&bull;	Impacts health behavior by providing accurate, credible and evidence-based cancer and smoking cessation information</p>
<p>NCI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small businesses concerns in performing the tasks/duties herein.  Based on the responses received from this SBSS notice, the proposed project may be solicited as a Small Business Set-Aside.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.<br /> <br />Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The project requires the contractor to manage the following scope of work in support of the NCI Contact Center: <br />&bull;	Cancer information (in English and Spanish) along the cancer continuum<br />&bull;	Clinical trials information and recruitment<br />&bull;	Information about NCI and its programs, priorities, and activities<br />&bull;	Smoking cessation counseling and information</p>

<p>2.	Manage personnel, financial, and material resources to ensure that all contract requirements are met and high-quality service is provided to the public.</p>
<p>3.	Develop, implement and evaluate the training for NCI Contact Center Staff. Training includes: 1) Initial Training; 2) Continuing Education (CE); and, 3) Coaching and mentoring sessions.</p>
<p>4.	Collect data routinely and on an ad-hoc basis using only NCI-approved data collection tools and systems and complete Electronic Contact Record Form (ECRF) for each contact at the time of the inquiry.</p>
<p>5.	Provide adequate facilities for the operation of the Contact Center and the operation of contract activities.  The Contractor will provide necessary office space, furniture and equipment (except where noted in the contract), workstations, resources, and supplies to carry out all activities of the contract.  The NCI Contact Center will be arranged to provide a suitable working environment and to facilitate effective communication and supervision.  The office layout will include area(s) for private conversations and coaching sessions, conference calls, and meetings. This also includes assuring the security of facilities used to conduct the work of the contract and the security of all Government-furnished equipment and systems.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received from vendors:

Question:
Can you please provide a Manufacturer of the Universal Caps that is shown in Details 6, 7,& 8 on Sheet AE501

Answer:
Per the specification section 097700, the basis of design manufacturer for the Universal Caps and Z clips, shown in Details 6, 7,& 8 on Sheet AE501, is Wall Panel Systems Inc. (http://wallpanelsystems.net/Three_Eighths_Inch_Universal_Architectural_System.html).

Question:
#1) E101, Detail 1;
In Toilet Rm. 2 there are two FA lights shown on the wall by the sink. Detail 2/AE302 confirms there are two lights in this location. These fixtures are not specified in Section 265000. There is a wall mounted bath light (Type LH) in this section but not shown on the plans. Please clarify.

Answer:  
Section 265000 will be updated in addendum to include a description of fixture type FA, and remove the fixture LH. Generally, the basis of design for fixture type FA is Tech Lighting, L.L.C. model: 600LNDWFS-CF.

<DESC>On February 18, 2016 the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Redstone awarded six small business (SB) contracts in support of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command's (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) Design, Development, Demonstration and Integration (D3I) Domain 2 Program.

<p><br />D3I Domain 2 will provide enhanced warfighter capabilities to the USASMDC/ARSTRAT mission by contractually supporting the Command's efforts to design, develop, demonstrate and integrate products focused on the development of space, missile defense, and high altitude capabilities that enable the Warfighter to effectively support USSTRATCOM, other Combatant Commands, Department of Defense, other Services, and other government agencies. D3I Domain 2 is a Multiple-Award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity vehicle procured as a 100 percent SB set-aside, with two reservations for service disabled veteran-owned SB, and provides for a total potential program ceiling value of $504M. Each awarded contract carries a 5-year base ordering period and two consecutive 2-year optional ordering periods within which specific Domain 2 task order requirements will be competed among the six awardees.</p>
<p>The USASMDC/ARSTRAT D3I program will be utilized to conduct research for the development of hardware components and software solutions for space, high altitude, missile defense, Information Integration and Data Exploitation, and Enhanced Warfighter Capabilities. Material and hardware products will be deliverable end items.</p>
<p>The total minimum guarantee and maximum quantity and value of supplies or services that the Government will acquire under this contract are as follows:</p>
<p>MINIMUM GUARANTEE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAXIMUM GUARANTEE<br />QUANTITY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VALUE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QUANTITY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VALUE<br />1 Order&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $10,000.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N/A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $.504B</p>
<p>The minimum guarantee specified above shall be executed at the time of basic contract award pursuant to the exception to the fair opportunity process described at FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(D) (note that minimum guaranteed task order is an obligation-only task order, which will be issued in order to comply with applicable Department of Defense and Department of Army financial rules (the minimum guarantee task order will not order specific supplies or services nor create an entitlement for the contractor to any or all of the amount obligated, orders for specific supplies and services will be issued subsequently pursuant to the terms and conditions of this contract).</p>
<p>The maximum value, as stated above, is a collective ceiling that will be shared among all MAIDIQ awardees across all contracts and task orders awarded. The contracts include contract line items types cost plus fixed-fee, cost plus incentive fee, firm fixed price, and fixed price incentive firm target.</p>

<DESC>Modification 002 incorporates into the order the contractor's proposed solution for Multi-National Information Sharing (MNIS) User Support for the Base Period and Option Period 1 in support of USSOUTHCOM for the Base Period and Option Period 1 of ITSS Order Number ID02140034.
<p>MNIS support is within the general scope of the order, the Performance Work Statement for which states:</p>
<p>"The scope of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) encompasses all aspects of the USSOUTHCOM (SC) Theater-wide Enterprise Information Technology Services Support Contract (EITSSC)."</p>
<p>The bulk of requirements for performance of the MNIS User Support were removed (struck) by Government mistake from the PWS during the solicitation phase.   References to MNIS remained in the PWS, but the full User Support requirement which is the subject of this mod was accidentally removed from the PWS because the Government was under the assumption that Colombia MNIS was being terminated.<br /> <br />The removal of the MNIS User Support effort, via removal of Paragraph 5.1.10.2.2 was a mistake on the part of the Government.  It was a legitimate requirement of the severable order awarded in 2015, and the requirement documents and order were corrected to reflect this.</p>
<p>The Price/Estimated NTE ceiling of Order modification 002 is $523,152.00.</p>

<p>&nbsp;This action is being approved as a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Bridge award to support the existing level of effort, under the Enterprise Development Support Services (EDSS), IDIQ number: ED-FSA-09-D-0007, task order: 0004, Investment Management/Project Management Support Services. The Bridge award will provide for Investment Management/Project Management support services that will assist in developing a portfolio management framework and documenting investment and portfolio management processes in order to implement the Investment Management Improvement Initiative Action Plan. This short term Bridge award allows for the uninterrupted services to be provided for the agency's establishment and set up of processes to enable Project Portfolio Managers (PPMs) in the strategic aspects of portfolio management. Currently, the FSA team has 60% less resources providing direct support to the Investment Management Group. Additional support for Tactical Portfolio Management is needed until positions can be filled. This work includes support for Investment Review Board meetings and logistics, portfolio tracking and planning, and maintenance of the Enterprise Sequencing Plan and associated management artifacts. It is anticipated that an award will be issued to encompass a six (6) month Base Period and three 1-month Option Periods while the award of a competitive contract action is completed.</p>
