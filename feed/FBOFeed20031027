<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with the Applied Biosystems (ABI), Foster City, CA for Applied Biosystems’ Geno Package III.  

This software is used for DNA short tandem repeat (STR) fragment analysis, a protocol that uses DNA sequencing equipment to size and genotype specific STR loci based on their various amplified lengths.  When fragments are compared to internal size standards and reference allelic ladders, the fragment sizes can be translated into genotype scores. The software in Geno Package III includes GeneScan and GenoTyper packaged together and used sequentially in analysis.  The former is used to size (calculate molecular weight) of DNA fragments and the latter is used to assign genotypes based on the weights.

This software is required by a joint project between the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the National Institute for Justice.  The goal of the project is to develop software to perform quality testing on DNA sequence data generated for forensic use.  The platform being used for DNA fragment analysis is ABI’s PRISM DNS sequencing/fragment analysis hardware.  ABI does not support third party software to collect data on their instruments.  Geno Package III is the software distributed by ABI to process the data collected on their instruments in a proprietary format.
 
This service will be procured under FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions.)  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm’s ability to meet the government’s requirements.  Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-021/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a digital stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) system. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Integrated Design Tools (IDT), Inc who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  A Digital Stereo PIV system is required to enable further studies of the phenomenon found in the flow field surrounding rotorcraft.  The PIV system is vital to enabling instantaneous planar three component velocity field measurements.  It would take substantial time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 6, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability is seeking an independent contractor to conduct a research study that examines critical issues surrounding the configuration, financing and delivery of long-term services and supports financing and systems reform. Current financing mechanisms will become unsustainable in the near future and without significant reform, tens of millions of Americans will be unable to find the wide array of affordable and high-quality long-term services and supports options we all expect and deserve.

NCD intends for this research to focus on the following areas: (1) current level(s) and type(s) of involvement by the Federal Government in a range of long-term services and supports systems and financing; (2) current and projected future needs for long-term services and supports in the nation among people with disabilities and people who are elderly; (3) gaps in long-term services and supports; (4) key features of (future) long-term care financing and systems reforms; (5) locales that have incorporated indicators of cohesive and comprehensive reform into their policy and service systems; (6) major challenges and barriers that locales face in moving toward cohesive and comprehensive long-term services and supports financing and systems reform; and (7) promising policy levers and policy changes.

Through this RFP, NCD will focus its attention and resources on an impending crisis in American domestic policy. 

The study plan should project a eleven (11) month implementation work schedule. The approximate release date and closing date are November 15, 2003, and January 5, 2004. The estimated contract period of performance is eleven months. Requests for copies of the RFP may be made by mail or picked up on or after the issue date at the above address. All requests should reference the number and title of the RFP. All inquiries regarding this RFP should be directed to Martin Gould, Ed.D., 202-272-2112 (voice), 202-272-2074 (TTY), mgould@ncd.gov or addressed to Long-Term Services, National Council on Disability, 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004.

<DESC>Availability of a prospectus for solicitation of offers to operate commercial services in Blue Ridge Parkway, in Asheville, NC at the Pisgah Inn. The operation will include food and beverage service, lodging service, employee dormitory housing and retail, gift and merchandise.  Gross revenues over the past three years have averaged approximately $2,700,000 annually. The term of this contract is ten years, and will require a minimum franchise fee to be paid to the National Park Service of 3% of gross revenue per year. The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR 51 has determined that this is not a qualified contract because gross receipts are expected to be more than $500,000 in the first year of the contract.  The current concessioner is not a 'preferred offeror'.  Therefore, if the current concessioner competes for this contract, and if the Park Service determines that a competing responsive proposal is the best proposal for purposes of contract award, then the current concessioner will not be given an opportunity to match the terms and conditions of the best proposal.  Offers must be received by 4:00 p.m. February_02, 2004. The Prospectus will explain the business opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the proposal instructions, and the proposal package (including the selection factors).  A site visit at Pisgah Inn is scheduled for November 12, 2003 as an opportunity for interested parties to visit the business and view the existing operation first hand.  A member of the park staff will be available to answer any questions. The scheduled time for the site visit is 1:00 p.m. We are requesting that all potential bidders please report on time. The site visit date could be cancelled due to bad weather. If this occurs, those who requested a prospectus will be notified within 24 hours in advance of the cancellation. We will notify those who requested a prospectus about another potential date if this happens. Please contact Rick Wyatt at (828) 271-4780 ext. 250 to make an appointment to attend this site visit. There will be an administrative charge of $60 plus a $5.00 mailing fee for each prospectus. Please make checks for $65.00 payable to the National Park Service. Include a physical address (not post office box) and telephone number. All requests for receiving copies of the prospectuses and questions regarding the prospectus should be submitted in writing and mailed to Henry Benedetti, Chief, Commercial Services, National Park Service, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA  30303.  No telephone requests for the prospectus will be honored. Please note that no further information than that provided above is available through any other internet resources or links. Concession contracts are not contracts within the meaning of 41 USC 601 et seq. (The Contract Dispute Act) and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal service contracts or other types of federal procurement actions.

EPA anticipates the award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Level of Effort (LOE), term type contract. The estimated LOE includes one, 12-month base period of 105,000 hours, plus four, 12-month option periods of 105,000 hours each. In addition, each period will include 5 quantity options of 9,000 hours each. The total potential LOE for each period is 150,000 hours. The maximum total LOE for all periods (five years) is 750,000 hours. Solicitation No. PR-CI-03-10355 will be issued on or around 10/27/03 and close approximately 30 days thereafter. It will be available on the Internet at www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the web site.

<DESC>SUBJECT: R ? Regional Oversight Contract (ROC) for Federal facilities, FUDS, or FUSRAP sites in EPA Region III, which includes the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. POC: David Senderling, (P)215-814-5309, (F)215-814-5211, senderling.david@epa.gov  DESC: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires professional architect/engineer (A&E) services to support the Agency in its mission of oversight and enforcement of both Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) activities at sites located at active, closing, closed, or former Federal facilities, including a Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS) or Formerly Used Site Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) site, and, to a lesser extent, non-Federal facilities within the geographic boundaries of EPA Region III.   	The Federal Facilities Compliance Act of 1992 waives sovereign immunity for Federal hazardous waste generators.  CERCLA ?120 and ?6001 delegate extensive oversight responsibilities to EPA for hazardous waste remediation projects at Federal facilities.  To fulfill these responsibilities, EPA reviews technical documents generated by the facility (or its contractor), approves remedies, oversees removals, assists in deliberations leading to agreements with other Federal agencies or non-Federal potentially responsible parties (PRPs), and determines appropriate penalties where necessary.  The successful offeror will be required to demonstrate competency in the following areas: technical document review; meeting support; field activities and data review; and technical support for such activities as CERCLA Site Assessments,  Remedial Investigations/ Feasibility Studies, Removals, Remedial Designs, post-Record of Decision (ROD) actions, community involvement and outreach, data management services, military munitions response services, radiation, and negotiations.        For purposes of this procurement, the Agency considers an offeror to have pre-award potential conflict of interest (COI) if the offeror currently holds a prime contract or subcontract with any party (other than EPA) for work related to CERCLA or RCRA activities, remedial planning or implementation, or reuse planning or development at sites located at an active, closing, closed, or former Federal facility within EPA Region III.  Any such potential conflict will be evaluated by EPA prior to award. 	This procurement is a small business set-aside using NAICs code 562910, Environmental Remediation Services (firms with 500 employees or less) and will result in the competitive award of one (1) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ)-type contract with a minimum guarantee of $10,000 and maximum of $4 million.  The contract will be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) with indirect rate ceilings and charges for direct labor, travel, and other direct costs (ODCs).  The period of performance will consist of a four-year base period and no option years.  The work will be handled via task orders which will generally be issued as completion form.  Subject to the availability of funds, the anticipated date of award is May/June 2004. It is anticipated that a significant portion of the work will be issued using Performance-Based Service Contracting (PBSC).  Consequently, the Statement of Work (SOW) will include performance requirements, performance standards, surveillance methods, acceptable quality levels, and incentives/disincentives. 	The resulting contract will be awarded pursuant to the  Brooks Act, Public Law 92-582 (40 U.S.C. 541, et seq.), using the procedures set forth in FAR Subpart 36.6.  As such, offerors shall submit Standard Forms (SF) 254 and 255 in accordance with Brooks Act A&E procedures.  Individual SF 254s should be prepared for the prime and any team subcontractors.  For this procurement, EPA asks that offerors organize the information on block 10 of SF 255 in a way that highlights responses to the evaluation criteria only.  This will help facilitate timely review of the information submitted.    	Selection will be based on the following five evaluation criteria.  The first four criteria are of equal weight.  The fifth criterion is of a lesser weight than any of the first four. 	1.   Professional qualifications of staff expected to  perform the services listed in the synopsis. 	2.   Recent specialized experience and technical competence of staff expected to perform the services listed in the synopsis. 	3.   Taking into consideration current and projected workload commitments, the firm's capacity to staff the contract with experienced, trained personnel at the appropriate levels and disciplines. 	4.   Past performance on contracts for similar services, with respect to cost control, quality of work, and schedule adherence.   	5.   Firm's geographic location and familiarity with the localities within EPA Region III. 	The selected firm will be required to submit a cost proposal, contract management plan, internal COI procedures, quality assurance plan, procedures for handling confidential business information, health and safety plan, and plan for delivering analytical services. In order to be awarded a contract, these must be deemed acceptable by EPA and agreement must be reached on a reasonable cost-plus-fixed-fee.  Prior to award, the contractor will also be required to have an acceptable accounting system that allows for segregation of costs.   	Firms interested in responding to this announcement are invited to submit completed SF 254s and 255s to the address shown below by 4:00 P.M. (Eastern) on December 3, 2003.  Forms must be RECEIVED at the EPA Region III office by the deadline; postmarks will not suffice.  This is not a Request for Proposal.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Battlespace Management and Air Defense Systems (BMADS), Radar Program Office is seeking information from industry on the ability to develop and produce a Sensor Netting System as applied to USMC radar systems, to include the Multi Role Radar System (MRRS) the Ground Weapons Locating Radar (GWLR) and the Highly Expeditionary Long Range Air Surveillance Radar (HELRASR) systems that are now being developed.  Sensor Networks are intended to rapidly generate battlespace awareness, synchronized operations, and maximize weapons employment.  Additionally, it is intended that a dynamically networked sensor grid will connect, share, and collaborate data (regardless of platform).  The network should also provide for Data Fusion, Sensor Tasking and sensor mode manipulation.  Furthermore, the sensor netting capability is intended to fill gaps in coverage by networking and fusing data and eventually provide internal sensor cueing in track development, detection, and engagement capabilities.  As part of the objective, the network should exist and operate within real-time parameters and allow C2 systems, sensors, and weapon systems to join or drop out without affecting the network.  The Concept for Sensor Netting must be capable of the following:  1.  Initially network USMC sensors: MRRS, Highly Expeditionary Long Range Air Surveillance Radar (HELRASR), Ground Weapons Locating Radar (GWLR), Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) Units and legacy radars with a high speed wireless link that operates in a real-time radar data environment.  2.  Eventually tie into joint architecture, Global Information Grid (GIG), USMC Composite Tracking Network (CTN) / USN Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) Systems.  3.  Link with Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S) and Complimentary Low Altitude Weapons System (CLAWS).  4.  Comply with Operational Requirements Documents (ORDs) and Information Exchange Requirements (IERs) of all netted sensors and systems.  The existing network consists of the radar sets and Tactical Air Operations Modules (TAOMs) (AN/TYQ-23(V)4) of the Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC).  Reference 1 establishes the requirements for the physical (electrical and mechanical) and the logical (message format and content) interfaces between the radar sets and the TAOMs.  The compliment of hardware to be installed in each radar to provide this interface is the TAOM Interface Group (TIG).  This interface is established between each radar set and a TAOM Interface Unit (TIU) located within the operations shelter of the radar set.  A second interface, at the radar shelter wall demarcation is established by additional specifications cited in Reference 1.  The TAOC may be comprised of up to five TAOMs, one AN/TPS-59 Radar Set, up to two AN/TPS-63 Radar Sets, and miscellaneous radio and ancillary equipment items.  Each of the radar set types provides organic sensor data to the TAOM via the interface described and controlled by Reference (1).  The AN/TPS-59 and AN/TPS-63 Radar Set specifications are cited in Reference 1.  MIL-STD-1397A (Ships), Military Standard, Input/Output Interfaces, Standard Digital Data, Navy Systems, and MIL-STD-1777, Internet Protocol form a part of Reference 1.  In the case of Theater Missile Defense (TMD) operations, the Sensor Netting System must have the capability, in the near term, to provide target information to the TAOC for dissemination to all air defense agencies and Surface to Air Missile (SAM) firing batteries (Marine Corps and Joint Services) by way of a common digital data link.  In 2008 the MACCS will employ expeditionary-networked sensors with joint/multi-national assets capable of multi-source fusion, sensor cueing, and provide fire control quality data to shooters.  The MACCS as part of the joint family of systems will be capable of tracking all airborne objects in our area of interest and supports the Aviation C2 Vision and the tenants of Network Centric Warfare.  Questions/comments and general responses should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Lee Kerr, by 4:00 p.m. EST, 1 December 2003.  Please submit all information to Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: CTQ2LK/Ms. Lee Kerr, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.  All UPS, FedEx, etc. deliveries should be addressed to 2201A Willis Street, Quantico, VA 22134-6050.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM/ARDEC is seeking qualified small business firms who can respond to a Request For Proposal (RFP) to manufacture and deliver  approximately 9,000 each M795 High Explosive Projectile Metal Pallets. Delivery is required within six months of date of award. Options of up to 9,000 each may be purchased the following two years. The metal pallet is used to palletize eight M795 projectiles for shipping and storage.   Each metal pallet assembly consists of a top and a base to unitize eight (8) 155mm projectiles held securely by two rods.  The metal pallet shall be made to be decontaminable through utilizing a Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) paint (for the cover and the base), non-flammable and reusable.  Each unit shall allow projectiles to be easily palletized in the field with no special tools required.  The latch rods are machined steel rod assemblies with zinc plating.  Each assembly is made of formed steel sheets that are welded together with eight holes punched out to hold the projectiles.  Additionally, the eight holes in the cover and base are lined with plastic inserts to protect the projectiles.  The metal pallets are to be made from high strength, low alloy steel. The Government will not facilitize prospective offerors.  Any offeror will be required to self facilitize at their own expense. A Firm Fixed Price Contract is intended for this effort. Interested manufacturers are requested to submit a capabilities statement by Electronic Commerce (EC) to egleason@pica.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Request for Information (RFI) for High Performance Computer System for the Forecast Systems Laboratory
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) anticipates acquiring a High Performance Computing System (HPCS) that will enhance the computing capabilities within NOAA. This enhanced computational capability will replace one of NOAA's current HPCS platforms housed at the Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL) in Boulder, Colorado. The replacement system will be known as the NOAA High Performance Computing System for Research Applications (NHRA) and will provide a primary resource needed to carry out NOAA's research mission. Increased computational power is essential for NOAA to meet its strategic goals related to weather, air quality, climate forecasting, coastal and ocean resource management and National commerce support, thereby providing improved service to the Public. In order to fulfill the objective of acquiring the NHRA in FY2004, NOAA will use the Department of Commerce's re-engineered acquisition process referred to as "Consolidated Operations" or CONOPS, described in "Department of Commerce Acquisition Process Case for Change" (available from the CONOPS home page located at http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops). An NHRA acquisition team ("the Team") has been formed within the Department of Commerce, and a Project Agreement has been drafted between the team and management to spell out the objectives, milestones, approach, budget and resources available for the project. The Draft Project Agreement and associated documents describing this project are available on the Internet at the project web site (http://nhra.fsl.noaa.gov/). Interested parties should continue to monitor this web site for additional information concerning this project.

NOAA is seeking varied concepts and innovative approaches to obtain the needed computing system within the time frame and budget allocated. Publishing of the Draft Project Agreement is intended to provide the high-performance computer industry a general overview of the requirements, time frames and budget, as well as to open a formal communication channel between industry and the Team. The Team also has a draft Statement of Need (SON) on the Project web site, with information on how to obtain initial benchmark codes. The Team welcomes industry comments, questions and suggestions, which will aid them in developing its acquisition strategy and finalizing the SON.

The team will consider input received in response to this RFI as it continues to develop the SON and the Request for Proposals (RFP). The Team does not anticipate the need for a pre-proposal conference, but if one is deemed necessary, information will be posted on the Project web site.  The Team may conduct one-on-one communications in an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI.

Parties interested in providing information which the Team may use in developing the Government's technical or acquisition approach should review carefully the Draft Project Agreement and supporting documents referenced in the draft Statement of Need that is available on the Internet at the Project web site (http://nhra.fsl.noaa.gov/).

One of the purposes of this RFI is to provide vendors with initial benchmark codes that will give an indication of the type of programs that may be expected to run on NOAA's new NHRA. A complete list of the major models and the schedule that must be maintained is available on the Internet at the Project web site (http://nhra.fsl.noaa.gov/). Instructions for obtaining the benchmark codes are available on the Internet at the Project web site. The Team requests that vendors submit their benchmark test results with their RFI response. This will give NOAA an indication of the performance capabilities of their recommended computing resources. One of the principal outcomes of vendor/Government dialog will be to ensure that viable approaches are considered during the competition. The Government may therefore utilize the information provided to design its acquisition strategy to take into account viable acquisition alternatives.

In addition to using the information provided by vendors to assist in its acquisition strategy, the team may also use the information to determine which vendors do not appear to be viable candidates for the eventual award of a contract. Those vendors may be contacted and informed that it does not appear to be in their best interests to compete for the NOAA contract. However, if those vendors choose to remain in the competition and later submit proposals, the team will not be prejudiced by its initial determination. Any vendor that requests, will receive a written or oral explanation of the team's initial determination as it pertains to that vendor.

It is not the Government's intent to disclose vendor proprietary information and trade secrets to the public. The information submitted by vendors during the pre-solicitation period may be used by the Government in preparing its RFP and finalizing the SON, provided this can be done without disclosing proprietary vendor information that is protected from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations.

The Government intends to entertain separate proposals for the Mass Store System (MSS) and the computational platform. Interested vendors should respond in writing to the following topics (vendors who submit written responses will be invited to augment their written responses with a 2-hour oral presentation in November/December 2003.)

(a) Indicate if their response is for the Mass Store System or the computational platform or both.
(b) A description of a NHRA that meets or exceeds NOAA requirements while remaining within the estimated budget. The description must address how the proposed system will meet NOAA's requirements as illustrated by the benchmark codes.
				Probable Budget By Year
Year	          04	  05	 06	 07	 08
MSS		$2.5M	$0.5M	$0.5M	$0.5M	$0.5M
Computational					
Platform	$0.5M	$2.5M	$2.5M	$2.5M	$2.5M

(c) An upgrade plan (including business and technical approach) of how the Government will benefit during the life cycle of this acquisition. The following topics should be addressed:
(1) A technology roadmap and how it relates to the length of the contract and the frequency of upgrades.
(2) Potential architectural transitions through initial installation and across upgrades.
(d) A description of the services, which will be provided to maintain the NHRA and/or the MSS over its proposed 5-year life.
(e) Potential financing alternatives to include a straight purchase for the MSS and/or an operational lease for the computational platform, and rough cost estimates for the alternatives, broken down by hardware, software, and services, and any other associated costs. It is the intent of NOAA to acquire the NHRA via a contractual arrangement satisfying the following conditions:
(1) The payments for system acquisition are expected to extend over 5 fiscal years (2004-2008) and may conclude with the system belonging to the vendor. The MSS could be purchased outright using a subset of the 2004 and 2005 funds.
(2) The intended life-cycle for the system is 5 years.
(3) If the Government owns the system at the conclusion of its intended life, the system could be operated longer than is now planned, at the option of the Government.
(4) If a vendor recommends straight leasing, the vendor must demonstrate the Government's benefit in not owning the equipment at the end of the project life cycle.
(f) A description of the vendor's qualifications for providing the NHRA (including the extent of subcontracting) and past experience in providing relevant computational capabilities.
(g) If relevant, the vendor should address the SCO v. IBM lawsuit and how possible outcomes may affect the viability and cost of systems software that may be offered.
(h) Benchmarks
(1) The vendor should attempt to compile and run the initial benchmark codes, compare the vendor's results with NOAA's results, and keep a record of the time required to run the code. FSL expects to receive two sets of timings and results: those from (1) the code essentially unmodified and (2) an optimized code. For purposes of this RFI, essentially unmodified means that the Fortran applications are untouched, but modifications to the internals of the software system known as SMS, and other communications packages utilized within the benchmarks, may be extensive provided the Fortran subroutine interfaces and the associated semantics are unchanged. Any modifications to the code should be thoroughly documented. If a benchmark simply cannot be run essentially unmodified, the vendor should inform NOAA through the web page to initiate a dialogue regarding that benchmark code. It is not critical at this point for the vendor to try to fully optimize performance on the benchmarks during this RFI phase. NOAA only requests timings to establish a basis for dialogue and a better overall market picture. All results and timings, which the vendor reports, will be kept in complete confidence.
Page 4
(2) Initial benchmarks are provided that test computational capability and the ability to analyze data. The initial computational benchmarks are the RUC- 20, RUC-13, WRF, WRF-Chem, LAPS-MM5, GFS and ROMS models and the data analysis application associated with each model. The benchmarks may be acquired by following the instructions on the Project web site (http://nhra.fsl.noaa.gov/T). There are instructions on how to run each benchmark, as well as how to determine if a run is successful. 
(3) The vendor is requested to provide results on running the benchmarks. Precisely what should be provided is included in the Draft Statement of Need and other documents available on the Project web site.
(4) The vendor should report the time required to get the benchmarks operating
properly.
(i) A performance-based contractor incentive plan.
The vendor's submission should reflect an understanding of NOAA's requirements for product delivery and an overall approach to providing the required capabilities. Multiple or alternative approaches are welcome. Although this RFI requests specific information, it is not intended to discourage innovative thinking on the part of industry to propose alternative solutions or approaches that the team may not have considered.
Interested parties may also submit comments or suggestions in addition to or in lieu of a written approach.

<SUBJECT>70 -- NOTICE OF GOVERNMENT INTENT TO ESTABLISH AN AGENCY STANDARD
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to inform the vendor community of the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) intention to establish the IBM DB2 Content Manager software suite as the Agency standard for enterprise document management.  SSA is adopting a document management architecture (DMA) to provide the framework for an enterprise-wide integrated system to store, manage and access unstructured data for its more than 80,000 employees located in over 2,000 offices around the world.  Implementation of the DMA requires that SSA establish and maintain an unstructured document repository (UDR) consisting of imaged documents of different types and sizes, including electrocardiograms, photographs and extensible markup language documents, as well as video and sound recordings, and designate a supporting Agency standard enterprise document management software suite.  

The initial implementation of the UDR will be in support of the Agency’s Accelerated Electronic Disability Project (AeDIB) that will improve disability claims processing by moving all partners in disability claims adjudication/review to an electronic business process through the use of an electronic disability folder.  When fully implemented, AeDib will add 32 million documents comprised of 308 million images to the UDR, annually.  These documents will occupy more than 7 trillion bytes of digital storage media.  In addition, AeDIB requires that the UDR support 500,000 annotated audio recordings and transcripts that occupy 45 trillion bytes of digital storage media.  AeDIB is anticipated to have up to 10,400 concurrent users accessing unstructured data at a projected rate of 700 pages per second. 

SSA has identified the following enterprise document management software suite requirements as critical to the successful implementation of the UDR:

1)	Demonstrated ability to successfully support UDR workloads equal to or greater than the projected AeDib workloads, through single or multiple existing implementations;

2)	Storage and maintenance of document images and indices in a relational database including data elements to identify, describe and locate each document;

3)	Capability to use the standard relational database query language Structured Query Language for pre-defined or ad hoc inquiries against the UDR document index;

4)	Support of repositories residing on the IBM zOS, IBM OS/400, Sun Solaris and Microsoft operating system platforms;

5)	Support of access to documents in the centralized and distributed processing environments employed at SSA;

6)	Compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973;

7)	Certification to DoD JITC 5015.2-STD;

8)	Accessibility from a commercial federated search and retrieval tool to logically search and combine data in disparate repositories; and

9)	Management of digital media, including data streaming of audio and video recordings.

With the assistance of outside experts, SSA has validated its requirements and assessed the ability of products in the market place to meet them.  These market studies show that the IBM DB2 Content Manager suite is the only product that meets all of these requirements and, therefore, should be established as SSA’s standard for enterprise document management.

This document does not constitute a solicitation for offers.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  Pricing data is not requested or required.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any Government evaluation of submitted information.  Any responses to this notice should be submitted electronically within 15 calendar days to amy.pasciak@ssa.gov and refer to the SSA Enterprise Document Management Software standard.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services on a sole source basis with R. Dennis Pool, Silver Spring, MD to continue services currently being provided by the contractor under purchase order number 467-MZ-300103.  The contractor will continue to provide a range of research services to the Digital Manuscript Program (DMP), including writing description metadata for digitized material on NLM's online historical archive, Profiles in Science, and providing research assistant services for the research and writing of background and interpretive materials on the prominent scientists, physicians, and public health leaders featured on the Web site.  R. Dennis Pool has made significant contributions to DMP's goal to provide descriptions for individual items featured on its ongoing Profiles in Science site, and well as its intention to make background materials, including glossaries and bibliographies, available to the site's users.  As new material is added to the online archive, Pool's research assistant services will continue to be critical.  Subsequent to the award of this purchase order, the program area has determined that the project requirement is significantly more complex than originally anticipated.  Consequently, additional funds, time and effort are needed in order for the contractor to complete the project.  Introducing a new contractor at this point in time would add significant amount of training time, government coordination, and therefore costs to the government.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide service as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H.
