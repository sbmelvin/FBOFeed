<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is soliciting proposals for Task Order type contracts to  assist in implementing health care marketing of products and tools at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.  The Agency is likely to make multiple awards.  The overall goal of these contracts will be to conduct Knowledge Transfer (KT)/Implementation activities so that selected target audiences put AHRQ’s products, tools, and research into practice. The contractor will be required to provide a broad array of support services based on AHRQ needs and the skill sets of each contractor.  

AHRQ’s Knowledge Transfer/Implementation program is intended to accelerate the implementation of AHRQ’s evidence based products, tools and research findings into the health care system.  AHRQ has identified the key groups that will be targeted as candidates for actual implementation of its products, tools and research findings and has been developing strategies that assist key target audiences to implement those research findings that hold the most promise to their respective organizations.

AHRQ’s KT/Implementation projects will reflect the mission and policy emphases of AHRQ. The nature of the products used and the complexity of the health issues to be addressed will directly impact project strategy, tactics and time lines. Tactics used in current projects include, but are not limited to, personal contact with a specific target audience by phone or e-mail; on-going follow up; cold calls as necessary; webinars or teleconferences with AHRQ staff, grantees or contractors serving as knowledge experts to explain a specific piece of AHRQ research; one on one technical assistance; group technical assistance; on-going contacts with target audiences to facilitate actual use of AHRQ research; speaking engagements by AHRQ staff at meetings of key organizations; learning networks composed of different organizations to contribute to the actual use of AHRQ research; and partnerships with key organizations to disseminate and help implement AHRQ research with an organization’s membership.

Over the past several years, AHRQ has focused more on producing impact from its evidence based research findings - encouraging target audiences to put research findings into practice rather than simply disseminating or transferring information. We are seeking “actual use” of AHRQ’s materials by those who actually deliver care or by those who make policy determinations.
 
The specific goals of the program are:
 
•	To enhance awareness among key target audiences about AHRQ’s evidence based product’s tools, and research findings. 
•	To increase knowledge among these audiences about the suite of AHRQ tools available for their use. 
•	To assist these target audiences in the actual implementation of AHRQ tools, research and products. 
•	To provide feedback to AHRQ regarding the successes and barriers that these target audiences are experiencing in implementing AHRQ materials. 
•	To give feedback to AHRQ about the kinds of research the target audience needs to provide high quality care. 
•	To develop impact case studies showing how target audiences have actually disseminated and implemented specific products. 

The base period of performance will be for 15 months with four (4) one (1) year options.  Funding will be provided on a Task Order basis.

 In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ's site at http://ahrq.gov.  Once in AHRQ's homepage, go to "Funding Opportunities", then to "Contracts", and then to "Request for Proposal (RFP)".  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor these sites for any subsequent amendments.  It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about April 30, 2009, with proposals due June 2, 2009.

<DESC><p>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) only. It is not a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued. This is an RFI for the purpose of conducting market research for an unmanned aerial system (UAS) able to support the detection of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Submission of any information in response to this RFI is COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY, and SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A FEE to the government.
<p>Description of Need. To increase the mobility of future military units, more technological efficient multi-capable tools must be developed.</p>
<p>Current Situation: US Forces are encountering large numbers of IEDs in both urban and non urban settings, which have been placed above ground, within vehicles and buried. US forces currently use a variety of robotic platforms for recon of IEDs, Vehicle Bourn IEDs and secondary devices. These platforms are slow getting down range and the height at which the cameras can observe suspect items is limited. The use of an unmanned aerial system would decrease time on target, eliminate exposing personnel to hazards and enhance reconnaissance capabilities. Therefore, the Hanscom Electronics Systems Center seeks a UAS with the following technical capabilities: <br />a. portable vertical takeoff and landing (less than 250lbs including fuel and battery and able to be carried by a Medium Mine Protected Vehicle).<br />b. Rugged and reliable, able to withstand daily usage operating in harsh environments (hot, cold, humid, dusty, sand, maritime, shock). <br />c. Radio frequency remote controlled capable (300m range minimum) and interoperable with current fielded systems i.e. passive early detection systems, Vehicle Optic Sensor System, electronic countermeasures, counter radio electronic warfare, etc. <br />d. Low light and infrared camera capable to view/observe suspect devices. One fixed camera to provide front view and a pan/tilt zoom camera for bottom view from UAV. Ideally would like two pan/tilt and zoom cameras to provide 180 degree front and 360 degree bottom view from UAV. <br />e. One person operator control unit with video/controls clearly visible in direct sun without any washout or glare. <br />f. Battery operated (UAV &amp; controller), rapid recharge capability using 110V/220V or heavy fuel (JP8 or diesel). <br />g. Operational Capabilities. Threshold: 60 minutes. Objective: 8 hours. <br />h. The platform should be able to be monitored and controlled through a mobile control station and no special military operational skill should be necessary to control the platform operations. <br />i. Video feed real time to the operator on target, with real time link capability back to Tactical Operation Center (TOC). <br />j. Capable of carrying a payload. Threshold 20 pounds. Objective 50 pounds. <br />k. Semi autonomous flight, landing and takeoff utilizing GPS. <br />l. The system will be capable of being operated at ranges of 200-3000ft above ground level and not exceed 15,000 feet above sea level. <br />m. The system will be capable of maneuvering at speeds from hover to a forward speed of 50kph.</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit a capabilities package in response to this RFI. Capabilities packages should describe your capability to provide the UAS with the technical thresholds described above. Additionally, capabilities packages should describe if the UAS is a mature technology (e.g., has it been fielded/sold in the past, or is it developmental?), provide information on any similarly awarded contracts, and provide company information (address, point of contact, etc.). Responses to this RFI are due no later than 1600 Eastern Time on 1 May 2009. Responses are requested not to exceed ten (10) pages. Please submit responses to David Bianculli at david.bianculli@hanscom.af.mil. Please direct any questions about this RFI to David Bianculli at (781) 377-1265.</p>

<SUBJECT>Audiometric Test Frequency

<CONTACT>Dwight D Favors, Contract Specialist, Phone (513)533-8137, Fax (513)533-8283, Email dyf3@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>Determination of the Variability of 8 kHz as an Audiometric Test Frequency Relative to 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6kHz
<p>BACKGROUND<br />Presently, 6 kHz is the highest required test frequency in most U.S. hearing conservation audiometric monitoring programs. Without testing at 8 kHz, it is not possible to determine the presence or absence of a notch at 6 kHz. Worse yet, without testing at 8 kHz, a 6 kHz notch would mimic the appearance of age-related hearing loss (presbyacusis). Because audiologists and occupational hearing conservation technicians are currently taught to look for a 4 kHz notch, it is likely that a noise-induced hearing loss manifested by a 6 kHz notch would be misdiagnosed as presbyacusis. The results of the recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on the hearing of American adults has found the noise notch may occur more commonly at 6 kHz rather than at other frequencies where noise notches may also occur, i.e., 3 and 4 kHz. In a subset of 175 noise-exposed male participants in the NHANES survey, 99 were found to have notches at 6 kHz vs. 14 and 62 at 3 and 4 kHz respectively.</p>
<p>Presently, there is resistance to incorporating 8 kHz as a standard test frequency because of a widely held belief that it is not possible to obtain reliable 8 kHz hearing thresholds. The physiological dimensions and acoustic resonances of the external auditory meatus not withstanding, this belief is not substantiated by data; however, it has assumed an unwarranted acceptance among the audiological community as being true. Pilot analyses of NIOSH data collected during a study of hearing among auto plant workers have demonstrated 8 kHz hearing threshold measures to actually be more reliable than some of the current standard audiometric test frequencies. The proposed effort will be designed to compare the reliability of 8 kHz to current required audiometric test frequencies. If the viability of 8 kHz as a reliable test frequency can be demonstrated, i.e., if 8 kHz hearing thresholds can be measured as accurately as thresholds at other frequencies, then this effort will overcome existing resistance to the use of 8 kHz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;PROJECT OBJECTIVES<br />This effort shall determine if 8 kHz is sufficiently reliable as an audiometric test frequency to be incorporated as a standard test frequency during the annual audiometric monitoring component of a hearing loss prevention program.</p>
<p>This shall be accomplished by: <br />1. Determining the relative reliability of pure tone hearing thresholds as a function of repeated measures taken on the same day. <br />2. Determining the relative reliability of pure tone hearing thresholds as a function of repeated measures taken on different days.<br />3. Quantifying the extent to which the reliability of 8 kHz hearing thresholds are similar to or different from hearing thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz, for both males and females between the ages of 20 and 69.</p>

This area will then be 		renovated to provide a new 4 bay Pre-Op space with full height privacy walls.  A new nurse 		station and new patient toilet will also be incorporated into this space.  Walls will be removed 		to allow visual control from the existing main nurse station.  The existing meds room will be 		expanded into an adjacent storage room to service both the existing PACU area and the new 		Pre-Op area.  The new  Pre-Op area will be able to be utilized for both Pre-Op and recovery 		dependant upon surgery scheduling.  A non-mandatory site visit will be held at the Cheyenne             Veterans Affairs Medical Center on 22 April at 1:00PM, building 11.  The project magnitude is                          500K to 1 million. 		Phase I of this project is advertised under VA-259-09-RA-0209 and both projects will be evaluated utilizing the same criteria with separate pricing for Phase I and Phase II.  Award will be made to the same contractor for Phase I and II, the only reason we have separate solicitations is because we have stimulus funding for Phase I and need to keep the funding separated by having two separate contracts.  To be responsive contractors need to fill out and submit proposals for Phase I under solicitation VA-259-09-RA-0209 and for Phase II under VA-259-09-RP-0208.

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&D) proposals in the
area of electric field detectors (E-FED).  The goal of this program is to develop devices that can detect small electric fields over large frequency ranges while being compact and power efficient.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.  

Electric field sensing is often performed using an antenna and receiver combination.  In these systems, the sensitivity is related to both the design of the antenna and the receiver electronics.   Obtaining a system that has a high sensitivity over a broad frequency response is not possible.  In addition, since the antenna size is related to the wavelength of the signal, the electric field detectors are relatively large (especially at lower frequencies) so that compact detectors and arrays are not possible.  Sensor architectures that do not have an antenna (either optical or high impedance based) have as yet not demonstrated the high sensitivity of the antenna based systems.

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to DARPA-BAA-09-34@darpa.mil. See full DARPA-BAA-09-34 document attached.

Contact Point(s):  Eugene Crank, Technical Reviewer, 805-982-5589 Response Due Date:  15 MAY 2009
Description:This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the NAVFAC Engineering Service Center (ESC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement is open until 15 May 2009. NAVFAC ESC is interested in a software based model that can be used to analyze the integration of photovoltaic systems, wind energy systems, conventional diesel generation, and energy storage.  The model should address design issues related to the following: 
.	Renewable energy resources have intermittent availability (e.g., wind speed varies, isolation varies, etc.).  .	Space limitations often restrict energy storage strategies and capacity of RE generation that can be installed.  .	There may be multiple renewable energy systems installed where little or no configuration was made to accommodate future integration and control.  .	Maintaining micro-grid/building-level circuit stability during outage
The purpose of the model includes the following: .	to provide analysis needed to optimize use of photovoltaic (PV) power and wind power, diesel generation and maintaining stability during outage.	provide analysis of energy storage requirements.	provide an analysis needed to integrate multiple planned/unplanned PV and wind power 
This announcement is for abstracts only and shall be no more than five (5) pages of technical material.  The abstracts shall outline the topics of interest.  The abstract may be supplemented by resumes and list of publications relevant to this announcement which will not count against the five (5) page limit.  The award will be for up to $400,000.   Multiple awards may be made under this announcement.  Topics of interest described below are provided as guides to areas that must be included in the abstract for the model.  Also, it is expected that abstracts will not limit the approach to only these specified in the topic list.  Individual topics of interest are as follows:
1)	The model will include solar and wind generation, energy storage, and controls that isolate the building in event of a power failure, and integrate renewable power with that from diesel back-up emergency generators.  2)	The model will be enhanced by incorporating data from manufacturer performance data. 3)	The model will provide an analysis of interoperability, performance characteristics and financial performance of various integrated renewable systems and back-up diesel generation.  Measure system response time, first cost, output, reliability, maintenance and percent load provided.  Test and recommend strategies to power isolated loads directly from renewable systems, isolate buildings from the grid or control renewable and emergency generators via control systems (e.g., Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems).4)	The model will predict interoperability of distributed, multiple, installation level renewables systems. The results will be used to recommend technical guidance for implementation multiple renewable systems through-out a Navy base for maximum benefit.

The software model shall be compatible with running on a MS Windows based computer without having to make non-standard operating system modification(s).  Past experience with utilities related computer modeling, renewable energy systems, power generation is desired. 
Evaluation Board (TEB) may request a full scale Proposal of no more than 25 pages. NAVFAC ESC may share the abstracts and the proposals with other Dept. of Defense (DOD) personnel of offices associated with this topic. Information that is sensitive or proprietary must so be marked page by page in the abstract and or proposal. Multiple awards may be made. The request for a proposal does not obligate the government in awarding a contract. CRITICAL NOTE: A CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR). NO CONTRACT AWARD WlLL BE MADE TO ANY CONTRACTOR THAT IS NOT REGISTERED OR IN THE PROCESS OF REGISTERING WITH THE DOD CCR THE DOD CCR MAY BE REACHED AT (888) 227.2423, OR WEBSITE WWW.CCR.GOV.

This solicitation shall also contain options for the accomplishment of FOA and PSA for LPD 25 (SOMERSET).  There will be no drydockings for any of these availabilities.  For LPD 21, efforts will include an 8 week FOA in FY10 to complete system installations and capabilities that were not part of the basic construction and that are necessary to support ship Post Delivery Test & Trials (PDT&T).  A PSA of up to 14 weeks for LPD 21 will follow in FY10.  For LPD 25, efforts will include an 8 week FOA in FY12, followed by a PSA of up to 14 weeks also planned in FY12.  FOA/PSA efforts include all manpower, support services, material, and associated technical data and documents required to prepare for and accomplish these avai! labilities.  The work to be accomplished will include correction of Government responsible deficiencies, installation of approved engineering changes (that were not incorporated during the construction period) and new work identified between ship delivery and the start of FOA/PSA.  Efforts will include engineering and management support of FOA/PSAs, testing and post repair sea trials, and other emergent work.  The proposed contract will include scope to allow for emergent availabilities to correct Government responsible deficiencies identified after delivery that must be corrected to support test & trials prior to the start of the FOA/PSA.  During FOA/PSA, the ships will be made available for completion of Fleet funded repairs and changes.  Work on these two vessels will take place in the homeport area of Norfolk, Virginia.  Third party access must be granted for the purposes of allowing work to be performed by Government Alteration Installation Team (AIT) and allowing the ! building yard to complete unfinished and warranty work.  A responsible offer will be considered eligible if the offeror has previously executed a master agreement for repairs and alterations of vessels or is a ship repair firm that can demonstrate those qualifications.

All responsible offerors that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com.  Offerors that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

<a href="mailto:Kline.Margaret@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541712   This is a SOLE SOURCE procurement, not a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Change Division (CCD) Climate Economics Branch (CEB) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order in accordance with FederalAcquisition Regulation Part 13 "Simplified Acquisition Procedures" to Ohio State University Research Foundation in Columbus, Ohio.  The purpose of this purchase order is to advance CEB's terrestrial emissions, mitigation, and impacts analyses capabilities by enhancing global economic modeling of both detailed forestry and agriculture land-use and market activity and general equilibrium modeling of the relative role of forestry and agriculture in the global economy.  This purchase order calls on the unique expertise and skills of Dr. Brent Sohngen and associates at Ohio State University.  Dr. Sohngen maintains the Global Timber Model (GTM), an internationally regarded, state of the art global forest economic climate model. The GTM model is regarded as the premier economic model for global forest carbon sequestration analysis.  The dynamic GTM was originally developed by Sedjo and Lyon (1990), further developed by Sohngen et al. (1999), and expanded to account for carbon sequestration incentives for forest owners by Sohngen and Mendelsohn (2002).  The model captures the complex biophysical and economic dynamics of forest management with a forward-looking model of world timber markets that considers future timber and land prices in managing timber stocks. The model has been used in climate economic estimates of global forest carbon sequestration as well as to estimate the effects of long-term changes in policies and the environment on forestry income, production, consumption, environmental attributes, and trade. This Purchase Order will leverage and build upon previous model development that has introduced aggregate crop and livestock sectors to the GTM with the next generation of the model, the Dynamic Global Forest and Agriculture Model (D-GFAM).   Purdue University's Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) and EPA have developed an initial integrated land-use and GHG database and static general equilibrium modeling framework for assessing the global potential for forest and agriculture GHG mitigation in applied general equilibrium models.  Dr. Sohngen and associates developed and provided critical global forest economic and carbon sequestration data, modeling parameters, and expertise in the development of the land-use database.  This is not a request for quotation.  No award will be issued should quotes be received in response to this notice.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. EPA, Margaret Kline (mail code 3803R) 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W. Washington DC 20460 or by facsimile at 202-565-2560 or by email to kline.margaret@epa.gov.  All written inquiries must include contact information such as full name, company name, phone number, address and email address if applicable.  Responses to this notice must be submitted within fifteen (15) days after this electronic posting.  Consideration of responses is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government, generally for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Lee Group, Inc. of Monroeville, Pennsylvania for Computer-Controlled SEM (CCSEM)Analysis of UNC passive aerosol samples.  The U.S. EPA believes that the R.J. Lee Group, Inc. is the only commercial provider of CCSEM services to have conducted hundreds of prior CCSEM analyses of UNC passive aerosol sampleas and has the license to manufacture and sell the UNC passive aerosol sampler.  A requirement for this purchase order is that the contractor must provide particle chemistry data, particle size and shape data, and particle images in formats compatible with the Zeppelin off-line particle analysis software used in the U.S. EPA's Electron Microscopy Laboratory.  R.J. Lee Group, Inc. is the only known company able to provide CCSEM data in these required formats.  The period of performance is expected to be August 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009, with the potential for a 1 year option period.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required analysis should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any response(s) exist, a Request for Quotations (RFQ) is not available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data, but instead choosing to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether an alternative qualified source is more adventageous to the Government, a purchase order will be issued to R.J. Lee Group, Inc.  Submit your response via email to passwaters.stacey@epa.gov.  Telephone calls will NOT be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Under the authority of the test program for commercial items (41 U.S.C. 428a) and  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), the VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center anticipates entering into sole source procurement negotiations with Stryker for the preventative and emergency maintenance of ICU Beds currently covered under the warranty of Stryker at the VA Medical Centers located in Milwaukee, WI.  The services are being sole sourced to Stryker as the ICU beds are currently under warranty from their company.  Maintenance provided by another vendor would void this warranty.  Therefore, to maintain the existing warranty on the items already purchased by the Government these requirements will be sole sourced to Stryker. This announcement is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR 6.302-1.  The above authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by supplies available from one source.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by 23 April 2009 at 1600hrs.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail.  All interest received on or before 23 April 2009 will be evaluated by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.

Sustaining engineering, but not CLS, also extends to 37 T-38C Aircrew Training Devices (ATD), including the Operational Flight Trainer (OFT), the Unit Training Device (UTD) and the Weapon System Trainer (WST). The ATD sustaining engineering support shall encompass software changes and/or upgrades (and any coinciding hardware changes/upgrades, as applicable). The complete T-38C avionics system consists of approximately 60 Non-Developmental Items (NDI) and commercial Line Replaceable Units (LRU) (note: the equipment that comprises the T-38C Avionics Suite may not be in the DoD supply system). The contract will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), performance based contract consisting of a base year (FY11) with four additional years of FFP options, encompassing the planned period between the fourth quarter of FY10 through FY15. The contract shall provide for: <br />a) An avionics block upgrade process that keeps the T-38C aircraft airworthy and current by providing up-to-date capabilities (e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS) approach) <br />b) Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) operations (avionics support) consistent with the local operational schedule at each of AETC's T-38C Main Operating Bases (MOBs) (Randolph AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB, Laughlin AFB and Sheppard AFB, with the ability to support AFMC operations at Edwards AFB, Holloman AFB, and Navy operations at Patuxent River Naval Air Station (aka NAS Pax River))<br />c) Spare parts and equipment which will guarantee the continued maintenance and flying operations support of the LRUs in the currently approved system configuration; contractor repair of removed components at the contractor's or Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) facilities and returned to COMBS, based on a fixed price for the combined annual number of hours flown by AETC, AFMC and the Navy Test Pilot School (approximately 96,000 hours total annually) <br />d) Technical order recommendations to an engineering organization <br />e) Contractor repair of damaged LRUs and maintenance of an effective damaged equipment program<br />f) Field Service Representatives (FSR) at each of the AETC MOBs, Edwards AFB and Patuxent River NAS, who will: <br />(1) Act as a liaison between the customer and home office<br />(2) Assist the on-site customer in detecting technical deficiencies<br />(3) Investigate and provide feedback to the customer on avionics issues and advise on solutions towards difficult or unusual problems<br />(4) Coordinate with COMBS to obtain parts<br />(5) Provide technical interface for engineering support<br />(6) Provide training for new personnel, as required<br />(7) Provide on-site customer support for the data collection system described in section 1(h)<br />g) Engineering processes to resolve any issues involving software support and material deficiency reporting for LRUs and ATDs<br />h) A system that collects, manages, analyzes and archives Maintenance Fault Lists (MFL)/Pilot Fault Lists (PFL), and engine, flight loads and Air Combat Maneuvering Information (ACMI) data for each flight, including mission planning and debrief data, that enables analysis and promotes product improvement<br />i) An effective means to manage obsolescence and Diminishing Manufacturing Sources<br />j) Engineering and program management expertise that ensures efficient and effective management of the activities and supplies necessary to meet program requirements<br />k) Maintenance of engineering and technical data<br />l) Tracking and reporting key avionics support performance to include system level MTBF, parts issue rates and avionics mission success rate<br />m) Over and Above (O &amp; A) activities necessary for correction of problems found during aircraft maintenance operations <br />n) Materials for O &amp; A corrections <br />o) Resolution of issues involving software support, engineering services, hardware/aircraft modifications, and material deficiency reporting in coordination with government organizations having Systems Engineering (SE) responsibility<br />2. Sustaining engineering includes SE and program management services to keep the avionics system for the T-38C training systems current/airworthy (e.g., requirements definition/generation, Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) and proposal preparation, as well as test and implementation of those changes). The contractor shall provide configuration management/control for the avionics components to include requirements and certification traceability, specification trees, supplier management and diminishing resources management. The contractor will record, monitor, and analyze equipment failures and provide recommendations to maintain or improve aircraft readiness levels. The contractor shall provide both technical and programmatic risk management. The technical services provided shall also include on-demand accident investigation analysis and support. The application of engineering and programmatic expertise includes planning for major and minor modifications to the avionics system for product improvements, or developing a solution in response to a discontinuance of commercial items (e.g. memory cards). As part of the T-38C community, the contractor must be able to react quickly and positively to real-world changes and have sufficient intellectual depth to bring in specific expertise from outside the program as required. A block upgrade process is used to keep the aircraft/ATDs airworthy/current by providing up-to-date capabilities (e.g., GPS approach). The block upgrade process enables a SE approach to systematically upgrade the aircraft and ATDs to keep them viable in a changing world. See Attachment 3 for additional details.<br />3. Primary CLS tasks include repair of removed failed or damaged LRUs, providing spares during the repair process, performing FSR tasks, and the effective operation of each AETC MOB's COMBS.

<p>SUBJECT: Request for Information (RFI) Regarding Third Generation Infrared Surveillance (3GIRS) Wide-Field-of-View (WFOV) Infrared Ground Segment Prototypes</p>
<p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Directorate of Development Planning, located at Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA is developing Third Generation Infrared Surveillance (3GIRS) technology and is conducting market research for consideration of Wide-Field-of-View (WFOV) infrared Ground Segment Prototypes.</p>
<p>The 3GIRS project office is assessing industry primes and their capabilities to develop and deliver a low-cost R&amp;D Ground Segment Prototype performing WFOV ground segment risk reduction. The ground prototype will focus on supporting Theater Missile Warning as a primary mission (Threshold) with Battlespace Awareness, Missile Defense, and Technical Intelligence as secondary missions (Objective). The prototyping effort assumes a WFOV payload will be selected prior to ground segment development.</p>
<p>The vision is to design and test an Open System Architecture prototype capable of expanding to function with multiple WFOV sensor types. The prototype must define a WFOV IR data standard that will inform multiple sensor providers on form, fit, and function for acceptance into the this Open Architecture and must provide output missile warning tracks for integration into the SBIRS missile tracking and reporting software. It's expected the Ground Segment Prototype will build upon and leverage the current risk reduction progress conducted under the Algorithm Development Lab and Aerospace Fusion Center. This R&amp;D system will investigate, test, and evaluate impacts of Theater Missile Warning operational acceptance and certification assessments as well as Reliability, Availability, Maintainability (RAM), timeliness of product delivery, and security in a network centric implementation.</p>
<p>The industry prime must have the capabilities to perform the following:</p>
<p>&#61607; Develop prototype H/W and S/W architectures and operating concepts<br />&#61607; Develop WFOV mission data processing algorithms and prototype mission data processing software<br />&#61607; Receive, process, archive, and disseminate WFOV IR data <br />&#61607; Develop the intra prototype interfaces, data standards, and external interfaces<br />&#61607; Develop prototype a mission management and payload tasking <br />&#61607; Performing integration between prototype space segment and prototype ground segment<br />&#61607; Responsible for ground prototype performance<br />&#61607; Develop creative options to maintain low Operations and Maintenance costs</p>

DESCRIPTION 
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide Technical Support for Operation and Maintenance of Advanced Signal Detection Software for the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERs) for a 12 month Base Period + 2 Option Periods.

GENERAL REQUIREMENT
The FDA requires the services of a Contractor to create an environment where CFSAN statisticians can mine CAERS data independent of the current production system, identify and perform CAERS data cleaning needs with respect to product and ingredient names, and update the current production CAERS database.  Specifically the Office of Food Defense, Communication and Emergency Response (OFDCER) requires services for the operation and maintenance of software designed to detect safety signals of potential food and cosmetic safety problems. CFSAN requires a system that allows product code corrections; that can merge with the current production CAERS database with no negative impact to the CAERS data; and that can be merged with a larger Agency wide adverse event reporting database even as FDA updates its current adverse event system.  Safety signals are individual food or cosmetic adverse event combinations that occur in a higher than expected proportion. These signals need to be carefully investigated to understand if regulatory action needs to be taken.  

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
a) Develop a signal annotation feature that allows users to differentiate signals that are disease related 
b) Develop a signal annotation feature that allows users to recognize duplicates reports, and/or reports that are linked in some other way e.g. related individuals
c) Develop alternative data mining techniques to determine approaches most productive for use in generation of safety signals in CAERS data and provide application of statistical tools such as time series analysis and logistic regression.
d) Identify and perform CAERS data cleaning needs with respect to product and ingredient names and possible product hierarchies.
e) Establish product hierarchies depending on proposed solutions, and to develop a flexible feature for count data.

<a href="mailto:Roxie.Keese@VA.GOV">Contracting Officer's email address</a>
<DESC>The VA Medical Center in Louisville, KY intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract to provide design services for an emergency water supply to replace 100% of water consumption for an indefinite period in the event the Louisville Water Company ("LWC") is unable to provide water to the VAMC-Louisville.  LWC is the sole source of water to the VAMC.  In the event the LWC can no longer provide water to the VAMC, the VAMC will need to shut down until water can be provided.  Many of the VAMC systems depend on water to include the boiler and chiller plants, the restroom facilities and the kitchen and dining facilities.
The VAMC stores 10,000 gallons of water in building #1 penthouse in four (4), 2,500 gallon tanks.  This is anticipated to be a one day supply for building #1.  These tanks will only supply water to building#1.  The water distribution system is not designed to have water from these tanks supply water to the rest of the VAMC campus.  This means the boiler plant will be without a water supply and will need to be shut down as soon as LWC water is shut down, denying heat and steam to building #1 and the rest of the VAMC.  With an average hourly consumption of 5,700 gal/hr these tanks will supply less than two hours of the hospital campus' water.  There are several possible alternate sources of water to the VAMC: 1.) Bulk Water  2.)  Bottled Water  3.) Rain Water Collection 4.)  Intake at the Ohio River   5.) Ground Water from a Well  and 6.) Water Well into the Louisville Aquifer.
An alternate water source will keep the needed water supplied to VAMC if LWC water is unavailable or unusable.  The construction cost estimate is for the construction of a water supply well, water distribution system, water treatment and possible water storage.  This system will connect to the existing VAMC-Louisville water distribution system, making up 100% water consumption of the VAMC-Louisville.  This emergency system will be activated during periods LWC water is unavailable.  Construction Cost range is between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.  Area of  consideration is limited to a 120 mile radius of the Louisville VA Medical Center.  The NAICS code is 541310 and the size standard is $4.5Million.  
A/E selection criteria will include:  1) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), and Veteran Owned small business status (VOSB) or other small business concerns.  2) Professional qualifications necessary for performance of required services; 3) specialized experience and technical competence of the A/E firm with similar type projects, including but not limited to where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials. 4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; 5) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  6)Location of A/E firm in the geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project;  7) Acceptability under other appropriate evaluation criteria. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. 
Potential contractors must be registered in CCR (www.ccr.gov) at the time of submission of their qualifications in order to be considered for award.  Standard Form 330 can be obtained athttp: //www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do  
Firms desiring consideration must submit three (3) copies of SF 330 not later than 2:00 p.m. EST on May 10, 2009.  SF 330 should be sent to Roxie Ann Keese, Contracting Officer, Acquisition Service Center VISN 9 (90C), Department of Veterans Affairs, 800 Zorn Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky  40206-1499.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
This Request for Information is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.
The Special Operations Peculiar Modification Kit (SOPMOD) Program managed at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) conducts Research and Development (R&D) directed toward ordnance and electronics, processes, systems, subsystems and components in support of our nation's war fighters.  The mission of the SOPMOD Crew Served Weapons (CSW) Program is to provide Special Operations Forces (SOF) with the flexibility and versatility to adapt basic issue weapons to meet SOF mission-specific requirements.  SOF lack organic heavy weapons such as tanks and artillery and are limited in capacity to carry or resupply ammunition.  Therefore, success and survival often depends on the effective employment of individual and crew served weapons.  Items contained within SOPMOD Miniature Day/Night Sight (MDNS) kit enhance the weapon's operational effectiveness through increased target recognition/acquisition, speed of engagement, and accuracy from Close Range Engagements to!  the maximum effective range of the weapon during both day and night conditions.  The Miniature Day-Night Sight for Crew Served Weapons (MDNS-CSW) is an enhancement to current optical augmentation (OA) systems and is designed to provide increased capability to engage hostile targets with crew-served weapons (CSW) in low-light/low observation situations.  The MDNS-CSW will improve the operational effectiveness of the family of SOF crew-served weapons by developing a modular system that improves target recognition, enhances target acquisition, and increases hit probability during day and night operations, and increases the probability of engagements out to the maximum range of basic weapons during all types of operations and environmental conditions.  Within these mission areas the SOPMOD Program is responsible for the full spectrum of R&D, acquisition, and SOF war fighter support.  Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and ! subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; and development of operational systems.
The SOPMOD program management team seeks to evaluate enhanced aiming, targeting and acquisition sights for crew served weapons including the M2HB, MK44, MK46, MK48, M240, M249, MK19 and MK47 weapons systems.  Information and example equipment may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, non-profit organizations, and institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia comprising such concerns.  The SOPMOD Program encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUB Zone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions.
Interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis.  This information should not exceed 4 pages or slides, with a summary on the effort, a product description, specifications, current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for 2-10 systems.  Offerors should submit this information electronically.  Information and product samples should be received within 30 days of this announcement.  All received information will receive SOF evaluation within 120 days of this announcement.  All product samples will be returned upon completion of testing.
The provided information will be evaluated by the Program Office, members of the SOF community, and employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) and possibly other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government.  At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed
The following e-mail point of contact is provided for information regarding technical programs/technologies of interest within the warfare areas supported by the SOPMOD Program and for submission of information: Mr. Liam Donovan, e-mail: james.l.donovan@navy.mil.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is expanding the measurement capabilities of high resolution solar spectrometry at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF). This involves the addition of an oxygen A-Band spectrometer designed for continuous routine operation at the Southern Great Plains measurement site. The oxygen A-Band spectrometer is a high resolution spectrometer capable of inferring atmospheric photon path length from spectroscopically-resolved measurements of absorption features of atmospheric molecular oxygen. Because oxygen gas is uniformly distributed in the atmosphere, variations in the photon path lengths from O2 band optical absorption arise primarily from multiple scattering of incident solar radiation from clouds and are thus related to 3-dimensional geometry.</p>
<p>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting information from prospective offers to provide Oxygen A-Band Solar Spectrometer in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>Retrievals of the atmospheric properties from the measured radiometric quantities require spectral resolution of 0.5 cm-1 or better (0.025 nm FWHM at 760 nm), signal to noise ratio of at least 100:1 at the depth of the absorption features, and out of band (OOB) rejection of 1e-4 or better, with a nominal measurement time of 1 Hz.</p>
<p>The provided instrument shall be designed to have low maintenance and be operated during all daylight hours extending for a (selectable?) period before and after local sunrise and sunset. Installation at SGP complete by September 30, 2010 along with complete instrument characterization in terms spectral resolution, out of band rejection, instrument response function as a function of wavelength, field of view (FOV), as well as demonstration of sufficient signal to noise under several representative conditions (varying cloud cover and solar zenith angles).</p>
<p>Interested firms shall also provide information in the following areas as available:<br />1) A description of current experience, knowledge and capabilities directly applicable to the performance of the scope identified.<br />2) Brochures providing descriptions of equipment, maintenance and standard warranty, along with a current published commercial pricelist.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort that will best address PNNL's needs. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Battelle does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>Please provide your expression of interest to the attention of the points of contact listed below.</p>
<p>If you have questions or need additional information, they must also be submitted in writing to the points of contact.</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration, Public Building Services  is conducting a Market Research to determine interested in potential opportunities in Security Escort and Burn Bag services for the White House Complex in Washington, DC.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The purpose of the RFI is to acquire sources who meet the minimum requirement as describes below.  In addition to the daily Security Escort and Burn Bag Services, companies must process an “ACTIVE” Top Secret Security Facility Clearance in addition to its employees who must process an “ACTIVE” Top Secret and/or Secret Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearances prior to starting work on the Complex.  These services are usually required on a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week basis.  Contractor personnel must be cleared in accordance with the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), the U.S. Secret Services and the Office of the Administration.  

In almost all instances the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) requires that contractor personnel and non-badge individuals who are visiting the White House Complex be accompanied by security escorts who possess TS/SCI Clearances.  These security escorts augment the USSS force and are a critical element in the success of the USSS mission.  This procurement may have a need for the contractor to provide up to  350 security escorts with top secret (approximately 75%), or higher (approximately 25%), security clearances. Failure to provide the required number of personnel could severely hamper operations on the White House Complex.  Potential cost, schedule, and performance risks are expected to remain consistent with historically experienced trends.  Offerors must demonstrate their technical capabilities, experience, and ability to manage the project within cost and schedule constraints.   This is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 561612.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil   65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>The TRICARE Southeast (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4) and Northeast (TRBO Reg. 1) Regions, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 93 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of CRUTCHES, CANES and ACCESSORIES. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the Southeast and Northeast regions based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source (s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in this multi-regional initiative include: Southeast Region - Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Commuity Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS), the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  Northeast Region - Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC), National Naval Medical Center (Bethesda, MD), Malcolm Grow Medical Center (Andrews AFB, MD), Dewitt Healthcare System (FT Belvoir, VA), Keller Army Community Hospital (WestPoint, NY), and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (FT Meade, MD).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The Southeast Region has been designated as the Lead TRBO for this standardization action.  The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is July 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Southeast and Northeast region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<BR> <BR>Point of Contact: Virginia Slayton, (706)787-2093, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Region are seeking product line items in the category of CRUTCHES, CANES and ACCESSORIES, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within the Southeast and Northeast region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $134,333.18.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast and Northeast regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Virginia Slayton, (706)787-2093, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EDT on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Southeast region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Southeast Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EDT on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Lead TRBO Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Regions Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast and Northeast region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast and Northeast region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to Virginia.Slayton@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor. <BR><BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR><BR><BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Crutches, Canes and Accessories products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>a.	At a minimum the vendor must provide the following: Standard Axillary Crutches (aluminum, push button, adjustable, sizes youth, adult medium and large), Canes (single point, aluminum, adjustable, curved handle), Canes (single point, wood, curved handle), and accessory items.  Accessory items, for this product line include; tips (crutch and cane), hand grips (crutch and cane) and underarm pads (crutch) to fit appropriate listed product line equipment.<BR>b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via catalog, and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Crutches, Canes and Accessories product line.  Vendor MUST provide the DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor (PV) (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor for the Southeast and Northeast Regions) for Crutches, Canes and Accessories in the Regions.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)  Vendor MUST provide supporting documentation (four digit code) of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal. <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Crutches, Canes and Accessories products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the Lead TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) attention at the participating Medical Treatment Facilities and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the Medical Treatment Facilities by COB, 5:00 PM EDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the Lead TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  <BR>2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient care setting using a Likert scale.   A one to five scoring range will be used to rate the sample products.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>4.	To determine acceptability, the Clinical Product Team (CPT), comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast and Northeast Regions will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a non-clinical / non-patient care setting. <BR>    <BR>The following Clinical /Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Standard Crutches<BR>1.	(Patient Safety) Height mechanism adjusts quickly with only simple steps required to make the adjustment.<BR>a.	The ability to adjust the crutch height quickly and simply will assist patients and clinicians in making safe and accurate adjustments.  (Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals, NPSG.09.02.01  Reduce the risk of patient harm resulting from falls by placing emphasis on properly adjusting the crutch).   <BR>b.	The evaluator will adjust the crutches and note whether adjustments can be performed easily and quickly.<BR>2.	(Patient Safety/Comfort) Hand grips minimize undue strain on the hand/wrist during crutch use. <BR>a.	An ergonomically designed and padded hand grip supports the palmar arch and wrist without causing undue rotation of the hand.  A proper handgrip also reduces; pressure on veins, arteries and nerves in the hand which helps decrease muscle fatigue and the potential for nerve damage.  (Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals, NPSG.09.02.01  Reduce the risk of patient harm resulting from falls by placing emphasis on pressure or discomfort related to hand grips.)    <BR>b.	Evaluator will ambulate, non-weight bearing, with crutches and note any wrist/hand discomfort related to hand grips.<BR>3.	(Patient Safety)Tips of crutches stay securely seated on the crutch, and promote stability, during ambulation.<BR>a.	Tips that are easily dislodged from the crutch or tend to slip during ambulation may increase the possibility of a patient falling during crutch ambulation. Any patient fall may cause injury.  (Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals, NPSG.09.02.01  Reduce the risk of patient harm resulting from falls by placing emphasis on monitoring for security of tip of crutches.  <BR>b.	Evaluator will ambulate, in a non-weight bearing manner, with crutches and note whether the tips stay securely seated during ambulation.)  <BR>4.	(Patient Safety/Safety) Underarm pads minimize underarm discomfort during crutch use.<BR>a.	Crutch pads without certain ergonomic features (smooth, curved surface with non-bulky padding) increase underarm friction causing irritation and soreness. Underarm pads use also decreases the potential for axillary nerve damage. Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals, NPSG.07.02.01 - Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections resulting from pressure ulcers by placing emphasis on identifying pressure and discomfort related to pad. <BR>b.	Evaluator will ambulate with crutches in a non-weight bearing manner, and note any underarm discomfort related to underarm pad design.  <BR>Canes ONLY<BR>5.	(Patient Safety/Comfort) Cane handle is comfortable. <BR>a.	 A properly designed and padded hand grip supports the palmar arch and wrist without causing undue rotation of the hand during cane use, minimizing muscle fatigue. (National Patient Safety Goal #9  Reduce the risk of (patient) harm resulting from falls.)    <BR>b.	Evaluator will ambulate using the cane in a partial weight bearing method, and note any wrist/hand discomfort related to the cane handle.<BR>6.	(Patient Safety) Tips of canes stay securely seated on the cane, and promote stability, during ambulation.<BR>a.	Tips that are easily dislodged from the cane or tend to slip during ambulation may increase the possibility of a patient falling during ambulation.  Any patient fall may cause injury.  (National Patient Safety Goal #9  Reduce the risk of (patient) harm resulting from falls.)    <BR>b.	Evaluator will ambulate, in a non-weight bearing manner, with canes and note whether the tips stay securely seated during ambulation.  <BR><BR>Pricing Analysis Process:  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast and Northeast Region combined.  Pricing must be received at the Lead TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EDT), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Southeast and Northeast region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast and Northeast Region). <BR><BR>The Southeast and Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Southeast and Northeast region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Southeast and Northeast region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Southeast and Northeast regions, (Post-Standardization Costs).  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  This is included as a reporting Matrix. (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  Operational Impact of RIA prices on the LSA Region are considered more important than other pricing elements.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 08 MAY 2009 5:00 PM EDT.<BR><BR><BR> <BR>

1.1  The USMC Regional Contracting Office Far, East (RCO) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in support of the Provost Marshal's Office (PMO), in seeking information on how an interested contractor could provide an all-inclusive and expandable access control system utilizing Biometrics and Automatic Identification Technology (AIT).  
1.2   THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning and informational purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Data submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. Information is being requested in order to make potential future requirements better for industry and the Government. 
2.0  A Statement of Objectives is attached to this RFI that provides furhter information regarding General Requirements, Required Deliverables and Performance Objectives.
2.1 PURPOSE: Installation access control is the backbone of the Security and Law Enforcement mission and posture aboard Marine Corps Bases Japan.  It provides the Marine Corps Base Commanding General with physical, technical, and administrative capabilities to reduce the vulnerability of unauthorized access, malicious activity, intelligence gathering and potential terrorist threats aboard MCB facilities at any given time.  This acquisition is for an all-inclusive and expandable access control system utilizing Biometrics and Automatic Identification Technology (AIT). The end product will provide the Provost Marshal's Office (PMO) with the capability of; (1) producing high quality, tamper resistant base access passes, (2) develop common/shared databases for access control, and (3) improve PMO capacity to screen/vet personnel while minimizing human error and constraints. The Biometrics and AIT capability shall enhance efficiency, personnel accountability, and visibility through!  automation of current manual processes and data interfaces.  
2.2 BACKGROUND: Recently published Homeland Security Presidential Directives, DoD Policy, and HQMC guidance have resulted in increased access control requirements for installation commanders.  Commensurate with a significant revision to current base access procedures, new requirements have been identified that require technological solutions.  Under the new policies, PMO has additional responsibilities for controlling a multitude of passes that are currently issued through a variety of organizations.  This equates to a significant increase in the number of passes PMO will issue, and subsequently be tasked to track and account for.  Given personnel restraints, this will require automation and the ability to leverage existing and newly created databases.  The current filing system and database are cumbersome and, at best, verification is time consuming.  After hours verification of locally produced passes is extremely difficult.  The current burden of verification rests comple! tely on the shoulders of the individual gate guard's ability to spot false or expired IDs and to manually screen personnel against debarment rosters, watch lists, or restricted access list via lengthy paper rosters.  If a pass is suspect, verification can only be made by contacting the PMO Pass Office during working hours.   The vulnerabilities with the current system are self-evident and equate to unnecessary risk to all personnel aboard MCB Butler facilities.  While HQMC is actively pursuing enterprise solutions for base access systems, standardizing requirements across the Marine Corps and identifying the requisite funding has proven to be problematic and has resulted in several false starts.  Installations Commanders have subsequently been authorized to pursue interim solutions in order to address immediate shortfalls and reduce vulnerabilities and risk.  The desired end state of this requirement is to lay the foundation for a fully expandable access control and technol! ogy based verification system while simultaneously providing (at a minimum); a significantly improved flash pass and pass management application, while providing enhanced access control capability for critical assets via handheld ID/pass card scanners with eventual expansion of this system to include handheld scanners for all entry control points and mobile patrol units across all camps/facilities.  Procurement of this state-of the art system will significantly enhance force protection measures at all Marine Corps Base Camp Butler facilities.
2.3 SCOPE:  The Contractor shall provide the necessary engineering, labor, construction, hardware, software, support equipment, materials, training, transportation, accessories, follow-on warranty and maintenance control measures, supervision and work control implementation to successfully design, engineer, install and test one (1) base access pass producing, filing and verification system in support of Marine Corps Base Japan.
2.4 PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  See attached RFI2.5 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: See Attached RFI and SOO2.6 REQUIRED DELIVERABLES(Minimum): See Attached RFI and SOO2.7   PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES: See Attached RFI and SOO
2.8 OPERATING CONSTRAINTS:.	Must meet all Marine Corps Information Assurance (IA) policies, specifically Marine Corps wireless solutions and FIPS compliancy.

<DESC><p>Chapter 10 Recorder Industry Day<br /><br />May 14-15, 2009 (Ridgecrest, CA). The recent explosion in the adoption of the IRIG 106 Chapter 10 standard for digital recording has resulted in a number of interoperability issues, mainly reproduction and reconstruction as well as replay of one vendor's files by a second or third vendor's hardware or software. In order to address and solve this problem the Recorder and Reproducer (R&amp;R) Committee, Telemetry Group, Range Commanders Council (RCC) is sponsoring a Ch-10 Recorder Industry Day. During the Industry Day the participating vendors will generate a compliant IRIG 106-07 Chapter 10 file which will then be distributed to other vendors to validate reproduction, reconstruction and/or replay. Any and all errors in reproduction, reconstruction or replay will be documented and included in current and future government procurements and, if applicable, as additions to future IRIG-106<br />standards, specifically Chapters 6, 9 or 10. Attendees are invited from vendors of ground recorders, onboard/airborne recorders, and software that have a capability to replay and/or display or process CH10 data. Any and all vendors are welcome to attend the Industry Day. However, several prerequisites (sample files, compliancy matrix, documentation of known incompatibilities, etc) must be met before attendance. The host of this event will be NAVAIR, China Lake and an official visit requests must be also provide. For an information packet and details contact Albert Gabald&oacute;n (albert.gabaldon@navy.mil, 760-939-6023) or Tim Chalfant (tim.chalfant@edwards.af.mil , 661 275-4444) or visit our website at https://wsmrc2vger.wsmr.army.mil/rcc/index.htm.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.303-1 and FAC 2005-30, this special notice announcement provides the Justification and Approval documents for Noncompetitive Contracts.
Sole Source Justification1) Region, Agency and ProgramRegion 7.  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council
2) Nature and description of action being approvedThe conduct of an in-depth subsistence harvest survey of use of spectacled and Steller's eiders in the North Slope of Alaska. Gather migratory and other bird and egg harvest information on a pictorial guide (OMB Survey Form 7-FW-103) for the correct survey periods in the following North Slope communities: Barrow, Pt. Hope, Wainwright, Nuiqsut, Kaktovik, Anaktuvak Pass, Pt. Lay, Atkasuk. Audit the information for correctness and completeness, and return the information (survey forms) to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Division of Subsistence, Data Management/Analysis
3) Description of supplies and services required:The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to provide the services and deliverables
4) Statutory AuthorityThe 1997 Protocol Amendment to the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty between the US and Canada provides for a regulated spring/summer subsistence harvest.  This treaty amendment lays the legal groundwork for the tripartite Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council consisting of Federal, State, and Native regional partners.  The accompanying report to the amended treaty specifies:1) The need for harvest monitoring2)  That harvest estimates will be collected cooperatively by the Council, including:a. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceb. Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G)c. Native regional partnersThe March 28, 2000, Federal Register notice, Establishment of Management Bodies in Alaska to Develop Recommendations Related to the Spring/Summer Harvest of Migratory Birds, (Volume  65, No. 60) states that annual funding agreements with Alaska Native organizations, ADF&G, and others will be used to accomplish harvest monitoring.  This Federal Register notice listed the 12 Native regional partner organizations, including the North Slope Borough, on page 16,408.  The April 8, 2002, Federal Register Notice, Procedures for Establishing Spring/Summer Subsistence Harvest Regulations for Migratory Birds in Alaska, establishes the program structure for the Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council.  It states in section (c), Roles and Responsibilities, that the Council will develop recommendations for harvest monitoring, and will establish committees to gather or review data.  A North Slope Borough representative is on the Council, and two North Slope Borough representatives are on the Council's Harvest Survey Technical Committee.
The North Slope Borough has a harvest monitoring system already in place in the North Slope region, which monitors harvests of several other wildlife and fish species. This includes contacts in its member villages, and an office in Barrow with trained and experienced harvest survey personnel.  So, in addition to the fact that the North Slope is a regional partner organization of the Council which is legally charged with gathering the data, it will be most cost efficient to use the North Slope Borough's existing system rather than setting up a duplicative system.The North Slope Borough is one of the three organizations that meets circumstance #5, Authorized by Statute.The North Slope Borough and ADF&G meet circumstance #1, in that they are the only responsible sources that will meet the agency requirement.  However, because the North Slope Borough has the personnel, experience, and expertise in the area, if ADF&G were awarded the contract, they would have to subcontract with the North Slope Borough, so it is more efficient for the Service to contract directly with the North Slope Borough.  
5) Why  does the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition require the use of the authority cited in item (4)?The nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited in item (4), because the data being provided by the acquisition helps fulfill the requirement that harvest monitoring be conducted cooperatively by the three members of the organization. Also, the North Slope Borough has unique qualifications, as outlined under (4) above.
6) What effort was made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practical?Among the three members of the Co-Management Council, potential sources were asked whether they had experienced personnel to conduct this work.  Through past surveys or survey attempts, knowledge was gained of who within the Co-Management Council has the experience necessary to conduct harvest monitoring. In addition, a preprocurement notice was issued on FedBizOpps with USFWS' intention to award a sole source procurement. No other responses were received.
7) The anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable.  The costs for doing these projects, in the areas where the Service does not  have the field personnel, experience and expertise, is no more than the costs to do similar projects in the areas where the Service does have the experienced personnel.
8) Description of Market SurveyThe requirement in the legislation and statutes is that this information be gathered cooperatively, by the three members of the Council.  Therefore, those in the commercial marketplace who are not members of the council, would not qualify.  Native organizations who  are  members of the council, are being involved through contracts and subcontracts, in the areas where they have the personnel, experience, and expertise. 
9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:Tribal councils and tribal members anticipate the subsistence harvest survey will be conducted by the North Slope Borough. Their participation in the harvest survey is voluntary. It is probable that if another contractor were selected that they would refuse to participate in the survey. Without tribal and individual participation, the harvest data necessary to manage trust resources would not be available. 
10) Any sources that expressed in writing an interest in the procurement.Shelly Adams of AMEC Earth and Environmental responded to the preprocurement notice seeking additional information. She did not express any other interest. To date, no other sources have written to express an interest.
11) The agency has taken all possible actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for supplies of services is required.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER U.S. EPA BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (BPA) 08-11.

The recent American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains $6 billion in funding for the State Revolving Fund programs, administered by EPA.  As part of the implementation of the ARRA, it will be important to ensure that EPA carries messages of sustainability forward.  The ARRA specifically requires that, to the extent that projects are available, 20% of the funding be devoted to a ‘green reserve,’ defined by the following categories:  green infrastructure (for wet weather), energy efficiency, water efficiency, and innovative projects.  Additional information can be found at http://www.epa.gov/recovery/.

This task order is for the development and production of outreach materials to support the implementation of the ARRA.  The ‘green reserve’ provisions place an emphasis on certain types projects that also support EPA’s goals under our existing Sustainable Infrastructure Initiative.   The materials to be developed are to promote awareness of these provisions to 1) encourage the submission of project proposals that meet the criteria, 2) encourage amendments to existing projects which make them more sustainable, and 3) to continue the emphasis on sustainable projects and practices throughout implementation of the ARRA.

The property is located at 381 Elden Street in Herndon, VA.  

The Government is using a tenant broker to represent them in lease negotiations for this transaction.  In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of the GSA or their authorized representative, Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc.

<p>RECOVERY. THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE INCUMBENT CONTRACTOR FOR THE WATER INTRUSION REPAIRS AT SAM M. GIBBONS FEDERAL COURTHOUSE, TAMPA, FL. The Real Estate, Design and Construction, in Region 4 of Public Buildings Services of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is announcing its intent to complete Phase II of the Water Intrusion Repairs at the Sam M. Gibbons U.S. Courthouse in Tampa, FL by retaining the contractor, American Restoration, Inc., using other than full-and-open competition, as regulated in Part 6.3 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation System. The delivery method has been changed from Design-Build to Design-Bid-Build. Using the Design-Bid-Build delivery method, GSA is requiring that the contractor use the construction documents developed during the investigation phase. The investigation and design services of the contractor's team were procured under the Best Value source selection trade-off process approach under FAR 15.101, where all evaluation factors combined were more important than price. The contractor's team has completed the investigation phase and is currently working on Phase I of the repairs.</p>
<p>Retaining American Restoration, Inc. and its current team to complete Phase II repairs will result in schedule efficiencies in completing the repairs. This approach also will eliminate inefficiencies associated with the knowledge base of the existing contractor's team and mobilization. Due to liability associated with the swing stages and overhead protection, the Phase I contractor will need to demobilize prior to the Phase II contractor starting work. The new Phase II contractor will have to reinstall their own overhead protection and swing stages which would result in significant time and cost inefficiency to the Government.</p>
<p>The completed repairs must meet all applicable federal, state and local guidelines governing this design. Should a party other than the current contractor's team perform the Phase II repairs, that party is required to accept liability for such work. GSA will rely on the current contractor's team member, Facility Engineering Associates, to remain involved in the repair efforts as a consultant to the Phase II contractor to ensure that the design intent is met through completion of repairs. The party performing the remaining repair effort also must successfully demonstrate the ability to meet criteria, which includes and is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>1. Provide evidence of past performance in providing building envelope uncontrolled water penetration repairs on similar projects for a minimum of 5 years.<br />2. Provide evidence of qualifications and experience of key management and field personnel.<br />3. Demonstrate a detailed understanding of building envelope systems.<br />4. Provide evidence of repair experience within the past 5 years for buildings that accommodate justice and law enforcement functions.<br />5. The ability to produce a work force where each employee working on site is required to pass a background security clearance check in accordance with HSPD-12 before accessing the site.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS, OR BIDS. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. NAICS Code is 236220. Small Business Size Standard is $31.0 Million. It is anticipated the Magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. This range does not necessarily reflect the proximity of the actual estimated cost. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Contractors who wish to comment on this intent or to express an interest in this procurement action must submit such comment or notice of interest in writing to Bobbie Clark, Contracting Officer, within 15 calendar days from the date of publication of this Notice of Intent. Any interested firms must be able to meet criteria, which includes and is not limited to, those listed in this Notice of Intent.</p>

<DESC>Defense San Diego:  Military and Industry Working Together To AdvanceTechnology in Acquisition of Major Weapon and Information Technology SystemsAFCEA San Diego is co-sponsoring the 31st Annual C4ISR Symposium May 5-7,2009.  The San Diego Chapter has over 1000 members, of which over 300 areassociate members through a corporate sponsor representing the heart of hightechnology in one of the country's most lucrative markets.  Their mission is toimprove government and industry preparedness in the field of C4ISR throughcooperation, association, and the encouragement of education in relatedtechnical fields.The annual symposium has become one of the most informative, broad-basedtechnical exchange forums of its scale.  It flows naturally from the annualWEST trade show occurring in San Diego each winter.  This years symposium isfocused specifically on the interests of the San Diego community andopportunities within reach.  The 2009 C4ISR Symposium will feature three daysof forward-looking briefings, panel discussions, and product displays fromseven organizations vital to the San Diego-based Defense Industrial community.Each is charged with developing, procuring, and/or delivering crucial buildingblocks that are pivotal to the security of our nation.  Industry will bepresenting industrys perspectives via panel discussions, displaying theirwares in exhibits, as well as sponsoring the event.  Our government co-sponsorsfor this event will be SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific, JPEO JTRS, PEO C4I, PEOEIS, PEO Space Systems, DHS S&T, and MCTSSA.On Tuesday, May 5, the multi-disciplinary Space and Naval Warfare SystemsCenter, Pacific will co-host the day.  The day will be directed by CommandingOfficer Captain Mark Kolheim, Technical Director Carmela Keeney, and keyProgram Managers.  They will discuss examples of their diverse roles, rangingfrom fielding and upgrading technology and supporting elements of the GIG toconceiving, developing, testing, and conducting sophisticated Science andTechnology demonstrations of crucial importance and interest to a broadspectrum of defense and other national agencies.  Tuesdays events will alsoinclude an Industry Panel during lunch and presentations by the Department ofHomeland Security Science and Technology (DHS S&T) Directorate.On Wednesday, May 6, the Joint Program Executive Office Joint Tactical RadioSystem (JPEO JTRS) will co-host the second day of the symposium.  Mr. DennisBauman and his team will present a full-range discussion of JPEO JTRSprograms.  JPEO JTRS will deliver their message about the JTRS capability tofellow local industry, government, and military contacts, and to listen tovalued input and feedback.  Wednesdays schedule will also highlight the workof the AFCEA Education Foundation during lunch and a new entry to thesymposium, Program Executive Office (PEO) Space Systems in the afternoon.Thursday, May 7th  will be co-hosted by the Program Executive Office (PEO)C4I.  Mr. Chris Millers technical staff members and industry partners join todiscuss major programs within the PEO.  The program will detail significanttechnology important to the PEO C4I Masterplan, with technical portfoliodiscussions on applications, communications, networks, and platform integrationwith a special emphasis on Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  Presentations willspark an earnest and candid discourse between industry and military partners.Such a dialog is crucial to mutual success in delivering capabilities of thewarfighter that will ensure their mission accomplishment.  Thursday will alsoinclude presentations by two other new symposium co-sponsors, Program ExecutiveOffice for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) and the Marine CorpseTactical Systems Support Activity.The San Diego Convention Center is this years venue.  The symposium will hostseveral networking events, allowing government and industry to exchangeinformation.  The goal of this exchange is to give industry the opportunity toinvest in the correct technology to be competitive and to bring the governmentthe best-value team for product development.  The event also allows thegovernment to learn what industry has to offer, encouraging the best solutionsfor warfighter needs, wants, and expectations.The AFCEA Education Foundation Golf Tournament will be held on Friday May 8,2009 in association with the Symposium.  The tournament will take place at theRiverwalk Golf Club in Mission Valley, San Diego.All proceeds benefit the AFCEA San Diego Educational Foundation for the purposeof public grants and scholarships for aspiring students who will be our futureengineers and scientists.For information on the 31st annual C4ISR Symposium May 5-7, 2009 visithttp://www.afcea-sd.org/new/C4ISR/

<CONTACT>Nathan C. Jordan, 508-233-6034

<a href="mailto:nathan.c.jordan@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Natick</a>
<DESC>PM-SOF Survival, Support and Equipment Systems will be hosting an industry information day at the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA on Thursday the 7th of May 2009.  The topic of discussion will be the development of a capability or capabilities to determine if Special Operations Personnel Advanced Equipment Requirements (SPEAR) Body Armor Load Carriage System (BALCS) soft armor inserts have been compromised leading to degraded ballistic protection performance.  The discussions will begin with a PM-SSES personnel brief on the requirements and detailed information on the desired capability.  This will be followed by an open industry question and answer session. [Background] United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) soft armor ballistic inserts serve as a vital component of the SPEAR ballistic protection system.  A mechanism does not currently exist to non-destructively evaluate the risk to performance through internal degradation of these vital pieces of equipment other than visual inspection (e.g. cuts, tears in the cover).  Once an item is issued to the SOF user community, confidence in its ability to perform as designed may decline depending on operational use and environment.  PM-SSES has determined that there is a need to develop a means of non-destructively evaluating soft armor to ensure that the users are fully protected.  Some of the more common issues associated with a decrease in ballistic performance in soft armor are moisture/water contamination (through a perforation in the water proof barrier) and limited field life due to extreme environmental exposure. As well, the legacy labeling on soft armor is extremely degraded during its lifecycle making it impossible to outline the initial date of issue or manufacture. [Desired Technology] PM-SSES will be utilizing the BAA process to execute a review of any developmental technologies and capabilities that may, through further development, act as a possible technology insertion into the current soft armor program to quickly and effectively determine if they have been compromised. The desired technology must meet the interoperability need and be easily incorporated into the current SPEAR BALCS soft armor system.  Additionally, the soft armor insert (with the identified technology insertion) must be able to meet all of the SPEAR BALCS soft armor performance requirements to include (but not limited to); ballistics testing, weight, environmental conditioning.  Following the industry day, we will be soliciting for white papers from industry leaders from a wide variety of industries e.g. textiles, colors and dyes, sensors, etc.  Vendors will have thirty (30) days to submit white papers for review to the outlined point of contact within the Natick Acquisition Center for consideration under the Broad Agency Announcement process.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, had awarded a sole source contract for Audiology /Speech Pathology equipment (complete digital strobe) that includes DICOM software which would allow for the capability of images from the evaluations done on this equipment to be transferred into the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) / Veterans Health Information Systems & Technology Architecture (VISTA) IMAGING System. A fixed price contract was awarded. It is the Governments belief that only KayPENTAX, a division of Pentax Medical Company possessed the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement. Please refer to the Sole Source Justification. This is not a solicitation or a request for information; it is a notice of a sole source contract award.JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALVA241-P-1177AUDIOLOGY/SPEECH PATHOLOGY EQUIPMENTSOLE SOURCE AWARD	JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION	1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity:VA Medical Center, Audiology and Speech Pathology Service, West Roxbury, MA 	This document constitutes a justification and approval for use of other than 	full and open competition for the acquisition described herein.  It is 	executed on behalf of the VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA.2.  	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.Sole Source Procurement for Audiology/ Speech Pathology equipment 	from: KayPentax3.  	The description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys 	needs (including the estimated value).Complete Digital Strobe recommended and funded by Central Office for the Polytrauma Program. Total cost: $53,770.00 (including shipping)Qty		ITEM					Price1 	Rhinolaryngeal Stroboscope (Model 9100B)	$15,9951	Rigid Endoscope (Model 9106)			$4,3201	Camera, 3-CCD (Model 9212)			$7,9251	22-37mm Zoom Lens Coupler (Model 9118)	$1,5751 	Digital Video Capture Module (Model 9200C)	$16,9951 	Printer, Color (Model 9264C)			$3251	Electroglottograph (Model 6103)			$2,1951	Cart (Model 9272)					$2,5951	Set-up & Training					$1,1954.	Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open 	competition.FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253  (1) only one responsible source. 5.  	Demonstration of the contractors unique qualifications:-	This equipment includes DICOM software which would allow for the capability of images from the evaluations done on this equipment to be transferred into CPRS/VISTA IMAGING. Other vendors/contractors of similar equipment do NOT include DICOM software.-	This equipment integrates with 6 fiberoptic endoscopes that we currently use, that can be used with this system. If other equipment were to be purchased, it would result in the equipment not being compatible these endoscopes that we currently use and we would have to purchase new scopes. The integration and compatibility of our equipment allows for more efficient patient care as our clinicians are already trained and familiar with this equipment and it allows for the most optimal situation for obtaining quality images during evaluations. -	We currently have a standard operating procedure for the reprocessing of Kay/Pentax scopes (which this equipment includes). Our staff is trained and demonstrates competencies in this reprocessing procedure. Obtaining different equipment would require that an additional standard operating procedure for reprocessing be developed and retraining for each staff member be completed.6.  	Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as 	many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FedBizOpps 	notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 and, if not, 	which exception under 5.202 applies.	A sole source notice will be published in FedBizOps.gov.7.	Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the 	government will be fair and reasonable.	Kay/Pentax has a Federal Supply Service contract with the VAs National 	Acquisition Center.  While these pieces of equipment are not on that 	schedule, the vendor has offered government discounted pricing.8.  	Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and 	date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the 	reasons a market survey was not conducted.	This is the only contractor that includes DICOM software, which allows for 	transferring of images to CPRS/VISTA IMAGING. 9.  	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, 	such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, or 	engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions 	suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not 	available.	- Our department currently uses the Digital Swallowing Workstation from 	Kay/Pentax, which has a similar set-up and also includes DICOM 	software. All our clinicians are trained with this equipment and therefore 	becoming familiar with this new equipment would require less training in 	comparison to purchasing a completely different system from another 	vendor.	This equipment was recommended by Central Office with the following 	rationale:	 This is an advanced laryngeal imaging system that digitally records 	stroboscopic and other endoscopic exams to a fully-integrated video 	capture and playback workstation. It includes a high quality imaging 	system for comprehensive assessment of the vocal folds structure and 	vibratory characteristics. It can also be used to record other endoscopic 	procedures (e.g., transnasal esophagoscopy) with superior image 	quality).10.  	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the 	acquisition.	None.11.  	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or 	overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition 	for the supplies or services required.	Contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition 	whenever possible.

VA258-P-0429Justification for Other ThanFull and Open Competition (JOFOC) Document
The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1"Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" and the Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 806.304.	1.  Agency Identification 	Department of Veterans Affairs (678)Southern AZ VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS)3601 S. 6th AvenueTucson, AZ 85723
2.  Description of Action Being Approved
This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) comes as a result of a current, on-going requirement at the Southern AZ VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) to provide the Dental Service a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) approved for use with VistA Imaging for long term image storage as required by VA Executive Decision Memorandum, Subject: Storing PACS Images in VistA Imaging, dated November 2005.  
Items being purchased in this acquisition: MIPACS Software Components which consist of MiPACS Storage Server Configurations, MiPACS Dental Enterprise Viewers (24) licenses, MiPACS Patient Updater, Implementation (Installation and Training) at SAVAHCS total number of days on site, Post Installation follow up visit to ensure the MiPACS Digital Imaging Enterprise system performance is at optimal level and to ensure good user experience with the system, number of days for post installation follow up two days and Technical Support which includes telephone and email support during normal business hours 9:00 am to 6:00 pm EST Monday through Friday.  
3.	Description  
Medicore Imaging's MiPACS solution was selected because it has been the only commercial off-the-shelve Dental PACS system able to: automatically acquire any digital image from any acquisition device; view acquired dental images on templates that Dental Service is familiar with (this translates to the MiPACS software has the hanging protocols which VistA does not have and allows dental studies to be saved as acquired in template fashion rather than one-by-one); and save images automatically in an electronic fashion to VistA imaging.  VistA imaging does not have the acquisition ability or the dental viewing environment. To the best of our knowledge, the MiPACS solution is the only product available that meets the needs identified by Dental.
 4.  Statutory Authority/Authority Cited  
The basis of this JOFOC is the criteria implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1,  "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." 
(a) Authority. (1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). (2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. 	5.  Reason for Authority Cited
The reason for citing FAR Part 6.302-1 as the statutory authority for this JOFOC is that it is appropriate in this situation where the agency's needs could only be satisfied by the unique supplies/services available through Medicore Imaging.  
Application. This authority shall be used, if appropriate, in preference to the authority in 6.302-7; it shall not be used when any of the other circumstances is applicable. Use of this authority may be appropriate in situations such as the following (these examples are not intended to be all inclusive and do not constitute authority in and of themselves): (1) When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by- (i) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities; 
6.  Demonstrate Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications.  
The following are some of the items that make Medicore Imaging. a responsible and reliable source:
The system shall support the Planmeca Digital Radiographic Equipment and images to DRM Plus, VistA Imaging and all current x-ray devices approved by the VA. 
The system must be compatible with the VA's existing VistA/CPRS systems, Windows XP, Dental Records Manager Plus (DRM Plus) and the VA's antivirus software. 
System must have future expansion and upgrading capabilities.  
The PACS system must be approved by the VA's OCIS-Health Information Security Division on three levels: Technical Vulnerability, Hardening Guideline Comparison, and HIPAA Control Analysis. System has to be capable of DICOM Query and Retrieve for complete inter-connectivity as well as DICOM Storage to VISTA.
 7.  Sources Sought Efforts.  
	 The MiPACs product is the only product currently on the market that has the hanging protocols to view dental images that is compatible with VistA Imaging. 
8.  Determination of Fair/Reasonable Price.  	
The price offered by Medicore is considered reasonable.

Software is approved by Silver Springs for use with VistA Imaging.  This requirement will be posted on FEDBIZOPS for ten days to give contractors the opportunity to submit quotes.  If no other firms are technically acceptable award will be made to Medicore Imaging

It is the government's intention to award this requirement using FAR Subpart 13.5 procedures. This is a full and open (unrestricted) procurement. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>Title/Description: Air Combat Command AMIC/PKA, Langley AFB, intends to purchase: 175 each "A" Bag Kits (Color: ACU); Various Qty of "Bag/Cases" (Color: ACU). Please see Attachment 1, for the individual contents of each kit/bag and bid schedule (offerors are permitted to use their own bid schedules).</p>
<p>Scope: The contractor shall supply all items and deliver FOB destination no later than the delivery dates noted in Attachment 1. Attachment 1 also lists the breakout of the items required to be delivered to the ship to address and POC. Offerors quoting an "or equal" item must provide a detailed description including manufacturer part number and literature with proposal.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria: Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA): Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><br />(a) Technical Capability;<br />(b) Delivery Schedule;<br />(c) Price</p>
<p>Offerors must meet the technical capability criteria by having any "or equal" submittals approved by the Government. Offerors must meet the delivery schedule criteria by being able to provide the required items no later than (NLT) the delivery dates noted in Attachment 2. Deliveries must be made in full by the required NLT dates. The Government will evaluate offerors delivery schedule for each individual item as a "pass" or "fail" based on whether or not the offeror possesses the ability to make full delivery prior to the NLT date required for each item. Offerors lacking the ability to deliver a particular item within the stated NLT delivery date will not be considered for award of that item (exception to follow). Those offerors with the capability of delivering prior to the NLT date(s) will be evaluated on their price of those items. The Government will not apply any type of special consideration to offerors who may be able to deliver items earlier than the required NLT deliver dates. The government may make multiple awards in order to obtain the best overall value for the Government. In the case of all offerors not being able to meet a NLT delivery date for a particular item, award may be made to the offeror providing the delivery date closest to the NLT date requested. Therefore, if an offeror cannot meet one or more of the NLT delivery dates, the offeror should provide the earliest date in which they can make delivery.</p>

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

1.	BACKGROUND: 
Founded in 1964, the White House Fellows program is America's most prestigious program for leadership and public service. White House Fellowships offer exceptional young men and women first-hand experience working at the highest levels of the federal government.
White House Fellows typically spend a year working as full-time, paid special assistants to senior White House Staff, the Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries and other top-ranking government officials. White House Fellows also participate in an education program consisting of roundtable discussions with renowned leaders from the private and public sectors, and trips to study U.S. policy in action both domestically and internationally. Fellowships are awarded on a strictly non-partisan basis.

4.	DELIVERABLES: 

The contractor will provide overnight accommodations, conference space, audio visual equipment, meal services, and shuttle bus service (if necessary), in support of the annual White House Fellows selection weekend event to be held June 9, 2009 through June 13, 2009.  Rendering of the services must occur before June 14, 2009 and include the following:

4.1.	Overnight accommodations
4.2.	Conference Space
4.3.	Audio Visual Equipment
4.4.	Meals
4.5.	Shuttle Bus Services

5.	QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN:

Note: the following Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)  is OPM’s codification of its method of implementing FAR 37.601, which requires that performance-based contracts or task orders- 

a)	Describe the requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; 
b)	Use measurable performance standards (i.e., in terms of quality, timeliness, quantity, etc.) and quality assurance surveillance plans; 
c)	Specify procedures for reductions of fee or for reductions to the price of a fixed-price contract when services are not performed or do not meet contract requirements; and 
d)	Include performance incentives where appropriate. 

Offerors must complete the QASP as part of their proposal. A description of the columns and information to be entered follows below. 

We will use the information provided as part of our evaluation of your offer.

(1)	Deliverable: One of the deliverables described in the “Deliverables” section above.

(2)	Performance Standard: The level of performance which the Government considers acceptable. A good performance standard in general should:
&#61607;	Measure important things;
&#61607;	Be simple, but not too simple;
&#61607;	Be auditable and capable of validation (quantifiable measures preferred, as they are less subjective);
&#61607;	Attainable and worth the cost;
&#61607;	Have a level of detail that corresponds to the intent of the stated measure and expectation;
&#61607;	Be consistently combined with other measures to reflect corporate priorities; and
&#61607;	Be controlled by the contractor.

(3)	Acceptable Quality Level: The range of deviation—if any—in which the Government will consider performance to be acceptable. Each offeror must propose an Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) for each performance standard for each deliverable. If the selected offeror fails to achieve stated AQLs, OPM will reduce the offeror’s payment for the services rendered in accordance with the disincentive formula. You must enter the AQLs for each deliverable in the Performance Requirements Summary Template for each deliverable that has a performance standard. 

(4)	Monitoring Method
(a)	This is the method OPM will use to monitor performance and determine the extent to which performance has met the standard. Offerors are encouraged to propose a sound process for verifying the accuracy of performance data on a continuing or recurring basis. Regardless of the method or degree of monitoring, we reserve the right to audit all performance data to independently verify its accuracy.

(b)	In general, we prefer monitoring methods that automatically capture measurements as part of the process and do not place a burden on either the offeror or OPM to collect and analyze data.

(5)	Incentive / Price Reduction 
(a)	For each AQL, your proposal must specify a maximum price reduction that will take effect if you fail to meet the AQL. The proposal must also specify the formulas and decision criteria that we will use to calculate the actual amount of price reduction for the related CLIN.

(b)	OPM is willing to consider proposals that include additional incentives for performance that exceeds the AQL. These incentives may be either monetary or non-monetary. 

(i)	For monetary incentives, your price proposal must specify a formula or set of decision criteria that we can use to calculate additional incentive payments to you. These incentive payments will only take place if you perform above the AQL. You must specify a maximum incentive payment that we will not be required to exceed, regardless of your performance.
(ii)	Some examples of non-monetary incentives that we would consider include, but are not necessarily limited to:
Revised schedule
Reduced oversight
Positive performance evaluation
Automatic extension of contract term or option exercise (FAR Part 17 still applies)
Lengthened contract term (award term contracting) or purchase of extra items (award purchase)
Publish article(s) in agency newsletter or speak at agency seminars
Letters of appreciation to individual employees, which may translate to bonuses
Use trade space for licensing, access to agency officials, etc.
Use those FAR clauses that can be negotiated to your advantage

(c)	Your selection of AQLs, incentive formula and price reduction formula will be important to our evaluation. Your response must specify the proposed method for measuring your performance against each performance standard, which we will compare to relevant industry benchmarks.

1752.205-70	Announcement of Contract Award 

OPM complies with FAR 5.3, Synopses of Contract Awards, in terms of synopsizing and publicly announcing contract awards. These actions take place at the time of, and not before, the contract is awarded. Contract award, in this case, means signature of the contractual document by the Contracting Officer and forwarding of the contractual document to the contract awardee. If the contract awardee wishes to make a separate public announcement, the awardee must obtain the approval of the Contracting Officer prior to releasing the announcement, and must plan to make announcement only after the contract has been awarded.

The Contractor must be capable of performing all the tasks described in the Statement of Work. The Government shall not be liable for any costs or other involvement in the purchase, repair, maintenance or replacement of Contractor items used to implement or comply with requirements of the contract.

(b)	Should the continued assignment to work under this order of any person in the contractor’s organization be deemed by the Contracting Officer to conflict with the interests of the Government, that person shall be removed immediately from assignment, and the reason for removal shall be fully documented in writing by the Contracting Officer.  Employment and staffing difficulties shall not be justification for failure to meet established schedules, and if such difficulties impair performance, the contractor may be subject to default.

1752.209-74	Organizational Conflicts of Interest 

(a)	The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor’s knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest (OCI), as defined in FAR 9.5, Organizational and Consultants Conflicts of Interest, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information.

(b)	The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential OCI is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure must include a description of actions, which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict.

(c)	The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contacting Office, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

(d)	The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer.

(e)	In the event that a requirement changes in such a way as to create a potential conflict of interest for the Contractor, the Contractor must: 
	(1)	Notify the Contracting Officer of a potential conflict, and;
	(2)	Recommend to the Government an alternate approach which would avoid the potential conflict, or
	(3)	Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will:
		(i)	Describe in detail the changed requirement that creates the potential conflict of interest; and
		(ii)	Outline in detail the actions to be taken by the Contractor or the Government in the performance of the task to mitigate the conflict, division of subcontractor effort, and limited access to information, or other acceptable means.
(4)	The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.
	(5)	If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to proceed with work, notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver must be submitted in accordance with FAR 9.503.

1752.222-70	Notice of Requirement for Certification of Nonsegregated Facilities

52.212-2  Evaluation—Commercial Items (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government intends to award a Best Value Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is determined by the Government to represent the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government’s needs.  In determining which offer represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government’s needs, the Government shall evaluate responses using the following factors in descending order of importance.  

1.	Technical Approach

The offeror will be evaluated on the extent to which you understand the scope of work, and that your technical approach to accomplishing this work is sound to include the following:  provision of space, quality of services and overnight accommodations, confirmation of overall quality rating and location, meal services, and shuttle bus service (if necessary).   The offeror should present their approach to meeting the requirements in sufficient detail to demonstrate their understanding of the project and to allow OPM to evaluate their approach. 

Your narrative should, at a minimum:

(1)	Indicate the initial plan to gain an understanding of OPM’s operations needs;
(2)	Discuss the anticipated methodology to complete the work listed in the requirements;
(3)	Discuss methodology to meet the requested delivery time frames; and
(4)	Describe your strategy for dealing with potential significant technical, administrative, or managerial problems that could arise, particularly those issues that impact deliverable deadlines.

2.	Past Performance 

Evaluation will based on your corporate experience (including results) with the provision of overnight accommodations, conference space, audio visual equipment, meal, and shuttle bus service contracts similar to this solicitation that the offeror has successfully performed in the past five years.

Your corporate past performance will be evaluated on the relevance of performance documented in submitted project summaries relating to type of work, complexity, and technical applicability of experience.

We will conduct reference checks in order to determine the offeror's corporate past performance.  In this regard, for each project listed, the offeror shall provide a point of contact (name and telephone number) to support past performance.  No more than three references are required.
The following considerations will apply to the evaluation of past performance: 

•	Quality of Product or Service: compliance with contract requirements – 

•	Timeliness of Performance: met interim milestones - reliable - responsive to technical direction - completed on time, including wrap-up and contract administration - no liquidated damages assessed.

•	Cost Control: within budget - current, accurate, and complete billings - relationship of negotiated costs to actual - cost efficiencies.

•	Business Relations: effective management - reasonable/cooperative behavior - flexible - business-like interest for the Government’s interests. 

•	Customer satisfaction: satisfaction of end-users with the Contractor’s services. 

Assessment of offeror’s past performance will be one means of evaluating the credibility of the quotation, and relative capability to meet performance requirements. 

Evaluation of past performance will often be quite subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will include a determination of the offeror’s commitment to customer satisfaction and will include conclusions of informed judgment.  However, the basis for conclusions of judgment will be documented. 

If an offeror, or its proposed employees, do not have a past performance history relating to this solicitation, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on this factor. 

3.	Price

Price, while neither a weighted criterion nor a controlling factor, will be an important evaluation consideration in selecting a contractor under this Request for Quotations.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  As technical scores for the contractors become more equal, price becomes a more determinate factor.

(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Feb 2009) An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. If an offeror has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at the ORCA website, the offeror shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (m) of this provision.

This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. The solicitation is not set aside for small business. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to procure the services for the NHLBI Division of Extramural Research Acquisition (DERA), Patrick Williams, 13600 Middlevale Lane, Silver Spring Maryland 20906-2121 to continue provide leadership, and advice to the Director, (OA) NHLBI on developing, implementing, and coordinating research contracts and simplified acquisition actions, as outlined below.

The estimated level of effort for this requirement is no expected to exceed 1,280 hours during the period of performance, beginning the date of award and for approximately six (6) months, for an average of three (3) days (24 hours) per week.

Period of performance:  The proposed period of performance for this service will consist of one (1) six (6) month basic contract period (May 1 thru October 31, 2009) and will include one option to renew for a six (6) month period (November 1, thru April 30, 2010).  

Background:
 The NHLBI Division of Extramural Research Activities (DERA) provides leadership and advice to the Director, NHLBI, on developing, implementing, and coordinating extramural research contract, grant, and training program policies. The Division also develops, implements, and coordinates cross-cutting, multi-disciplinary activities in the mission areas of the NHLBI. 
 
Objectives for the Procurement:  
The objective of this procurement is to acquire the services of an experienced and knowledgeable acquisition professional.

Task Description:
 Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide expert acquisition, management, and technical services to the NHLBI DERA Office of Acquisitions.  The general purpose of this statement of work is to provide overall acquisition and business management assistance to the NHLBI DERA OA Director, Deputy Director and Branch Chiefs.  These services include: planning, organizing, and coordinating assigned projects and activities. These services will enable the OA to more effectively manage its portfolio of research and development and station support activities.  

The specific current tasks include services as follows:
•	Advise OA leadership on critical issues, such as management, acquisition policies and procedures, organizational structure, and operational matters and specifically assisting the Procurement Branch Chief in evaluating the workload of the Procurement Branch to find more efficient and productive methods of operation;

•	Develop, prepare and provide training classes (developing relevant documentation and training materials on topics such as Market Research, Writing Statements of Work, Acquisition Plans, etc.);

•	Coordinate primarily with Procurement Branch Chief and with other R+D Branch Chiefs to assist and liaison with NHLBI and Customer ICs (CICs)  program staff on specific procurement related documentation and requirements;

•	Mentor NHLBI OA and program staffs on Federal and Departmental regulations and policies related to acquisition, especially in the Station Support areas;

•	Provide day-to-day assistance with file documentation, invoice processing,  training, and file reviews; 

•	Address problems with acquisition transactions, troubleshoot, and provide recommendations for correction; and

•	Perform policy and issue analyses for the OA staff on a myriad of topics as assigned.  Following these analyses, develop appropriate policy documents/memoranda/reports/presentations for higher-level review. 

Deliverables:
•	Monthly reports on all activities performed during the previous month.

•	Special reports, as specified by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative, in conjunction with the activities outlined above.

•	Status reports covering major project activities including issues, risks, staffing/resource changes, as required.


The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills, and expertise associated with Mr. Williams’ 25 years of employment with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in acquisitions.  Mr. Williams has extensive knowledge and experience of all phases of the NIH Research and Development and Station Support contract processes.  He is familiar with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the NIH contracting policy, procedures, and practices used within various Consolidated Operations Acquisition Centers (COAC) of the Institute.  In addition, Mr. Williams has extensive knowledge and experience with the NIH Business System (NBS), a new agency-wide, integrated financial and administrative computer system.  The functional knowledge of the NBS that Mr. Williams possesses is critical to carrying out the day-to-day business operations, i.e. the processing and execution of procurement actions.  This knowledge base coupled with his expertise in all phases of contracting, makes Mr. Williams an ideal individual to perform the required tasks.  An award to any other source would not be practical for NHLBI, Office of Acquisitions, in its mission to effectively manage its portfolio of acquisitions and station support activities; and furthermore, would not provide cost savings to the Government.

Basis for Award

The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter(s) whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach.  Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter’s quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoters’ technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.


Factor I - Technical Capability 

a. Contract Requirements 

Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter’s ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to lodging, meeting space, audio visual equipment and food and beverage requirements.  Quotations must address the offeror’s ability to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it relates to lodging and meeting space.  Quotations should reflect quality of services provided and maintained.
		
b. Location 
  
Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility located within the specified postal zip codes with adequate parking for participants and presenters.	 

c. Availability of Dates 
			
Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. The Government will not consider alternate dates.

Factor II - Past Performance 

The quoter must provide references for at least three (3) federal government contracts for similar work performed within the past three (3) years.  The quoter will be evaluated based on customer satisfaction and timeliness.  The contact information for each reference shall include the following: 

Contract type
Contract number
Contract/Task value
Agency/Company Name
Agency/Company point of contact telephone number
Duration of task/contract
Type of services provided (brief description)
List any problems encountered on each contract and the contractor’s corrective actions

EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of timely deliveries and customer service on similar requirements. NOTE: In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase quoters overall rating nor decrease it

Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable.  The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities portion of the technical evaluation factors.

Factor III – Price
The price quotation will be evaluated against the independent Government Cost Estimate.

Notice:  The Government reserves the right to make contract award without discussion with   quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, quoters must submit their most favorable terms from a technical standpoint.   In addition to the above, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The contractor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Item with your quote. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Item and Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order-Commercial Items are incorporated by reference.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the “bullpen”, serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field.  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.

The OTI Sr. Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed.  As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.  

OBJECTIVE

To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

The OTI Sr. Transition Advisor position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned.  The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.

Duties and Responsibilities

Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD), the Sr. Transition Advisor will:

•	Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in Washington, DC and the field, including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups and on-call technical assistance;

•	Conduct, in collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, assessments for possible new country programs, and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;

•	Act as OTI’s in-country Start-Up Manager for limited periods of time for new country start-ups, or provide support while an OTI Country Representative is on leave, or when OTI has not determined the length of a new country program, but is required to have a presence on the ground;

•	Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;

•	Negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee,  program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;

•	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;

•	Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;

•	Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;

•	Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;

•	Represent and articulate OTI’s mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials.

•	Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;

•	Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations; 

•	Advise Senior Management and Team Leaders on budget processes and reviews, preparing   justification documentation when necessary;

•	Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;

•	Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;

•	Help ensure that OTI’s programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;

•	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:

The OTI Sr. Transition Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the OTI Country Representative when in the field.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:

The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.

The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the “bullpen”, serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field.  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.

The OTI Sr. Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed.  As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.

OBJECTIVE

To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The OTI Sr. Transition Advisor, Worldwide position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned.  The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.

Duties and Responsibilities

Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD), the Sr. Transition Advisor will:

•	Act as OTI’s in-country Start-Up Manager for limited periods of time for new country start-ups, or provide support while an OTI Country Representative is on leave, or when OTI has not determined the length of a new country program, but is required to have a presence on the ground;

•	Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;

•	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;

•	Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;

•	Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;

•	Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is issued as a request for proposal.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31 effective March 19, 2009. The requirement will be a Full and Open Competition. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990, which has a Small Business Size Standard of $7.0M shall remain open for responsible sources to respond. Contractors are required to identify their company’s business size.  TSA plans to establish a single contract to fulfill this requirement. The resultant contract award will be one (1) year from date of award.  

BACKGROUND

In a continuing effort to reinforce security at GA airports, TSA will allocate funding to promote the use of the GA Secure Hotline, augment the current GA Grant Feasibility Study, and begin development of a framework for an airport security grant program. 

The GA Secure Hotline was instituted to provide a reporting mechanism for suspicious and security related activity at GA airports.  In the past the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) has developed marketing and promotional materials to distribute to 650,000 general aviation airport and aircraft operators, both members and non-members of AOPA.  TSA has previously funded the mailing services provided by AOPA to members of the general aviation community.

TSA completed a general aviation (GA) grant program feasibility study in December 2007 to answer the requirement in Section 161 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Act), Public Law 110-53, signed on August 3, 2007.  In order to further justify the implementation of a grant program, further study and analysis is required.  TSA will allocate funding to augment the current study and develop a framework for a future GA airport security grant program.

SCOPE

The contractor, in coordination with TSA, shall develop and implement a marketing plan, which includes distribution of informational materials, to promote the use of the GA Secure Hotline.   
Additionally, the contractor shall conduct an analysis of TSA’s existing GA Grant Feasibility Study and provide recommendations for implementing a GA airport security grant program.  The contractor shall develop a basic framework for a future grant program, to include guidelines for grant applications and the approval process.

The contractor shall distribute these materials to the current TSA Federal Security Directors (FSD) around the nation, who will deliver these materials to GA airports in their area.

Volume II Contents (5 pages): 
Factor 4.0 – Price Information   

All proposed prices will be evaluated via a Price Analysis to determine reasonableness and realism. The Government shall evaluate the Offeror’s proposed prices to determine that they are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror’s technical proposal and are reasonable as compared to the Government’s Independent Government Cost Estimate and other Offeror’s proposals.  

The proposal of each offeror determined to be technically acceptable or which could, after discussion (if applicable), be made technically acceptable, will be subject to a price realism analysis.  The price proposal will be evaluated to determine overall reasonableness and realism.

Price reasonableness and realism pertains to the offeror's ability to project prices which are reasonable and which indicate the offeror's understanding of the nature and the scope of the work to be performed. The Government considers that a fully justified and realistic proposal is of paramount importance in evaluating price proposals.  Any proposal lacking these attributes, regardless of its relative position with other proposals, will be considered lacking realism.  

In performing the price analysis, the Government may request supporting information from each offeror to substantiate the rationale for their proposed prices

If the Government determines after the analysis that the proposed price(s) are unrealistically low, these unrealistic prices will be considered in the risk assessment.  If the offeror’s technical proposal is within the competitive range, the Government will require the offeror to:

•	Demonstrate an understanding of the requirement for which unrealistic costs/prices are proposed; 

•	Demonstrate the capability to absorb the price differential between low costs/prices proposed and the probable real cost to meet the Government’s requirements;

•	Demonstrate an understanding that performance under a resultant contract will be carefully assessed to ensure that the appropriate caliber of support is provided. 

SOURCE SELECTION:  The Government intends to award a competitive Firm Fixed Priced Contract to the Contractor whose proposal, conforming to the combined/synopsis, represents the best value solution using a Trade-Off analysis. The Best Value Approach is a method of selecting the proposal that presents the best value to the Government, based on evaluation of each offer in the areas of Technical and Management Approach, GA Knowledge/Stakeholder Relationships & Experience/Past Performance and Price. The Source Selection Authority (SSA) may determine that a superior solution/approach merits a higher price, and therefore represents the best value to the Government. The SSA, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s relative capability.

The Government may: 
(1) Reject any or all submittals if such action is in the public interest; 
(2) Accept other than the lowest price submittal; and, 
(3) Waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 

Proposals that do not respond to all requirements in the solicitation may be rejected without further evaluation, deliberation, or discussion. The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be significantly not compliant with the solicitation requirements, unrealistically high or low in price, or reflects a failure to comprehend the requirement. 

The Government may award any resulting contract to other than the lowest priced Offeror, or other than the Offeror with the highest non-price rating. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions with Offerors. If the government determines that discussions are necessary, the government reserves the right to establish a competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306(c). The government reserves the right to limit the competitive range for efficiency.

<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>FACTOR 2: PRICE</p>
<p>Only price proposals submitted by offerors whose technical proposals are determined to be technically acceptable will be considered for evaluation. Award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable, responsible offeror with acceptable past performance. The lowest price offer will be computed by adding the total price for the basic period. Proposed prices will be evaluated using the price analysis techniques prescribed in FAR 13.106-2 to determine price reasonableness.</p>
<p>The standard is met when:</p>
<p>The price is determined fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 12.209.</p>
<p>FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Each offeror will be evaluated on their past performance based on existing and prior contracts using the attached Past Performance Questionaire as well as previous knowledge of contract performance.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

<p>(a) To the extent that this contract provides for furnishing supplies or performing services outside the United States and its outlying areas, this clause applies in lieu of any Federal, State, and local taxes clause of the contract.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>"Contract date," means the date set for bid opening or, if this is a negotiated contract or a modification, the effective date of this contract or modification.</p>
<p>Country concerned means any country, other than the United States and its outlying areas, in which expenditures under this contract are made.</p>
<p>"Tax" and "taxes," include fees and charges for doing business that are levied by the government of the country concerned or by its political subdivisions.</p>
<p>"All applicable taxes and duties," means all taxes and duties, in effect on the contract date, that the taxing authority is imposing and collecting on the transactions or property covered by this contract, pursuant to written ruling or regulation in effect on the contract date.</p>
<p>"After-imposed tax," means any new or increased tax or duty, or tax that was exempted or excluded on the contract date but whose exemption was later revoked or reduced during the contract period, other than excepted tax, on the transactions or property covered by this contract that the Contractor is required to pay or bear as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date.</p>
<p>"After-relieved tax," means any amount of tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that would otherwise have been payable on the transactions or property covered by this contract, but which the Contractor is not required to pay or bear, or for which the Contractor obtains a refund, as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date.</p>
<p>"Excepted tax," means social security or other employment taxes, net income and franchise taxes, excess profits taxes, capital stock taxes, transportation taxes, unemployment compensation taxes, and property taxes.

<p>(c) Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all applicable taxes and duties, except taxes and duties that the Government of the United States and the government of the country concerned have agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such country by or on behalf of the United States.</p>
<p>(d) The contract price shall be increased by the amount of any after-imposed tax or of any tax or duty specifically excluded from the contract price by a provision of this contract that the Contractor is required to pay or bear, including any interest or penalty, if the Contractor states in writing that the contract price does not include any contingency for such tax and if liability for such tax, interest, or penalty was not incurred through the Contractor's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) below.</p>
<p>(e) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any after-relieved tax, including any interest or penalty. The Government of the United States shall be entitled to interest received by the Contractor incident to a refund of taxes to the extent that such interest was earned after the Contractor was paid by the Government of the United States for such taxes. The Government of the United States shall be entitled to repayment of any penalty refunded to the Contractor to the extent that the penalty was paid by the Government.</p>
<p>(f) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that was included in the contract and that the Contractor is required to pay or bear, or does not obtain a refund of, through the Contractor's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) below.</p>
<p>(g) No adjustment shall be made in the contract price under this clause unless the amount of the adjustment exceeds $250.</p>
<p>(h) If the Contractor obtains a reduction in tax liability under the United States Internal Revenue Code (Title 26, U.S. Code) because of the payment of any tax or duty that either was included in the contract price or was the basis of an increase in the contract price, the amount of the reduction shall be paid or credited to the Government of the United States as the Contracting Officer directs.</p>
<p>(i) The Contractor shall take all reasonable action to obtain exemption from or refund of any taxes or duties, including interest or penalty, from which the United States Government, the Contractor, any subcontractor, or the transactions or property covered by this contract are exempt under the laws of the country concerned or its political subdivisions or which the governments of the United States and of the country concerned have agreed shall not be applicable to expenditures in such country by or on behalf of the United States.</p>

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.232-33 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER-CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)</p>
<p>(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.</p>
<p>(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--</p>
<p>(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or</p>
<p>(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).</p>
<p>(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.</p>
<p>(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.</p>
<p>(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--</p>
<p>(i) Making a correct payment;</p>
<p>(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and</p>
<p>(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.</p>
<p>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--</p>
<p>(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.</p>
<p>(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p>(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.</p>
<p>(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.</p>

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that— 
(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p>Respondents must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Milstar system and the 4th Space Operations Squadron (4 SOPS) &amp; 614th Space Communications Squadron (614 SCS)&nbsp;mission. Core personnel must have a thorough understanding and extensive background in Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, and joint deployment and tactics, as well as EHF terminal operations. This understanding is necessary for active participation in the 4 SOPS System Anomaly Resolution Team activities. The support requires an in-depth knowledge of Milstar EHF systems, communications operations, theater CONOPS, as well as a high level of expertise in network resource planning using the Milstar Communications Planning Tool-integrated (MCPT-i) and resource monitoring using MCPT-i and the Automated Communications Management System (ACMS).</p>
<p>A high degree of EHF satellite planning expertise is required to rapidly analyze new communications requirements, assess system and user impacts, and present well thought out options for the 50 SW and 14th Air Force Leadership, the EHF SATCOM Operational Manager, and/or the Joint Staff. Support must reflect a high degree of expertise in developing apportionment plans for the Milstar strategic community and experience in all levels of planning from peacetime to wartime scenarios.</p>
<p>Expertise in efficiently configuring constellation payload tables, developing terminal images for all EHF terminals, and experience in user data flow is mandatory. The effort involves detailed troubleshooting of user problems using Milstar Communications Asset Monitoring (CAM) data to identify and rapidly resolve communications related problems affecting Milstar users.</p>
<p>Expert support is required to plan, build, and manage the installation of Over-The-Air-Re-key tables for all terminals using the Milstar system and assisting in the operational activation of Key Authorization Tables. Support would be required to visit service key managers to reconcile 4 SOPS planning databases with those being used to distribute keys to active users.</p>
<p>Support personnel will analyze Satellite Authorization Requests/Approvals (SAR/SAA) submitted by military planners, prepare network activation schedules for 4 SOPS's 24-hour crews, distribute network communications plans, and provide real-time feedback of communications plans to Milstar managers.</p>
<p>Support personnel will interact with Unified Combatant Command and Joint Staff communications planners to ensure optimum 4 SOPS support is provided for exercise and contingency operations. Support involves daily analysis of all active Low Data Rate (LDR) and Medium Data Rate (MDR) communications services-constellation wide-and the preparation and distribution of daily user advisory reports to the war fighters outlining payload usage inefficiencies, services violating constellation usage directives, and addressing issues of concern to the user community.</p>
<p>Support will require active participation in Tactical Network Implementation Planning (TNIP) meetings to address single and global user issues, formulate/advocate/coordinate system policies, demonstrate/explain/train new capabilities, and develop courses of action to resolve system level deficiencies affecting Milstar communications. Effort will also require the regular attendance at working groups where issues affecting the current Milstar communications mission and future 4 SOPS capabilities are discussed.</p>
<p>Support personnel must be proficient in Milstar theory and satellite communications planning in order to provide routine classroom instruction for Joint Staff, Unified Combatant Commanders, Global and Regional SATCOM Support Centers (G/RSSC), RSSC planners, 4 SOPS personnel, and the Milstar Management community at large. Monthly training must be provided for the 4 SOPS 24-hour crewmembers in all aspects of the communications mission and advanced network troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<p>Support personnel will be required to produce documents that must adhere to professional technical writing and editing styles, and may include, but are not limited to: technical background papers, satellite resource utilization reports, monthly activity reports, and explanations of the results of data analyses.</p>

<p>General Information:</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) or the National Cancer Institute at Frederick (NCI-F). SAIC-F does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this Sources Sought Notice, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, SAIC-F may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in the future. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION SCHEDULED AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against SAIC-F shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the SAIC-F's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. Any questions concerning this solicitation must be directed through the SAIC-F Point Of Contact (SAIC-F POC).</p>
<p>RFI Number: S09-135</p>
<p>Posted Date: April 8, 2009</p>
<p>Intended Offeror's Response Date: May 1, 2009 by 4:00PM Eastern<br />Final day to submit questions: June 5, 2009 by 12 Noon Eastern<br />Final Response Date: June 30, 2009 by 3:00PM Eastern</p>
<p>Contracting office address: SAIC-Frederick, Inc.<br />92 Thomas Johnson Drive, Suite 250<br />Frederick, MD 21702-1201</p>
<p>Purpose of RFI:</p>
<p>SAIC-F is to seeking to identify a qualified contract research organization that is able to economically produce a new batch of clinical grade bulk endotoxin that is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices to replace the &gt; 30 year old bulk endotoxin currently in storage. PLEASE NOTE: An appropriate strain of E. coli would be required to be acquired by any potential Subcontractor should a Request for Proposal (RFP) and subsequent Subcontracting Agreement be offered to a selected offeror.</p>
<p>Project Goal:</p>
<p>The goal included in this statement of work is to produce a new batch of clinical grade bulk endotoxin that is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices to replace the &gt; 30 year old bulk endotoxin currently in storage. This project will be broken down into a Development Section, including MCB production, and purification process development. An engineering run of bulk endotoxin along with a pilot lyophilization study. The final stage includes cGMP Production; including GMP bulk endotoxin manufacture and GMP vialing and lyophilization plus a manufacturing report.</p>
<p>Anticipated Milestones and Deliverables:</p>
<p>Milestone 1 - Activity A: Production and characterization of a 200 vial Master Cell Bank.</p>
<p>The previous cGMP endotoxin was produced from the Escherichia coli (Braude strain) group O 113:H10:K negative strain that was isolated and characterized at the Bacteriology Division, Bureau of Laboratories, Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia (Ewing WH, Hucks MC, and Taylor MW (1952) J Bacteriology 63: 319-325). The BDP will contact Dr. Epstein to determine if this bacterial strain is available from the NIH Clinical Center, the FDA, or the CDC.</p>
<p>The potential Subcontractor will obtain the appropriate strain of E. coli and then manufacture and characterize the 200 vial MCB according to current standards. The potential Subcontractor will provide a list of tests to be performed. SAIC-F may provide the potential Subcontractor a source of the required strain if necessary.</p>
<p>Milestone 1 - Activity B: Purification Development.</p>
<p>R&amp;D grade E. coli cultures will be produced using the previously recommended chemically defined media and conditions. These cultures will be produced in the potential Subcontractor's laboratories using standard R&amp;D procedures and it is expected that this process will require minimal development work.</p>
<p>The resulting cell pellets will be used for purification development following the previous purification process used &gt; 30 years ago. The potential Subcontractor will provide a proposal for process modification (if any) to meet the required scale, cGMP compliance, and product quality. Such studies may include:</p>
<p>1. A 10 liter culture will be produced and subjected to phenol extraction to produce a single unpurified bulk that can be used for purification development studies. <br />2. Tests to replace a dialysis step with transmembrane flow filtration (TFF).<br />3. Determine whether the deoxyribonuclease digestion can be replaced with Benzonase digestion. <br />4. Testing chromatography as a replacement for the sodium acetate/ethanol concentration step.<br />5. Determine whether the final dialysis step can be replaced with TFF.</p>
<p>Milestone 1 - Activity C: R&amp;D Assay Development.</p>
<p>The potential Subcontractor will identify any method development necessary to perform the required release testing for the bulk and final vialed product shown in Tables 1 and 2.</p>
<p>SPECIAL NOTE: SAIC-F, with the NCI, will contact the US FDA for review of the proposed methods of analysis and specifications prior to initiation of the cGMP phase of the program. The results of that future discussion will be shared with the potential Subcontractor.</p>
<p>Milestone 2: Engineering Run/Pilot Lyophilization</p>
<p>The potential Subcontractor's laboratories will be used to perform a cGMP pilot run. A full scale production and purification will be performed to test the process and produce bulk drug substance. This drug substance will be used as an internal reference standard for the following studies:</p>
<p>1. QC assay development.<br />2. QC testing for comparability to previous endotoxin CC-RE-Lot3.<br />3. Drug Substance stability studies.</p>
<p>The potential Subcontractor may perform any or all of these studies. The potential Subcontractor will also perform pilot formulation and lyophilization studies based on requirements to produce final vialed product listed in Table 3.</p>
<p>Milestones 3 &amp;4: Production of cGMP Endotoxin</p>
<p>The potential Subcontractor will perform a full scale production and purification to produce cGMP grade endotoxin including the following activities:</p>
<p>1. Controlled fermentation will be conducted in a batch mode.<br />2. Purification will be performed to produce bulk drug substance. <br />3. QC/QA release of the drug substance.<br />4. Formulation, vialing, and labeling of endotoxin drug product (FVP).<br />5. QC/QA release of the FVP.<br />6. Stability program for FVP and, if required, bulk biological substance<br />7. Preparation of a Manufacturing Report (Appendix 1) to be included in <br />submissions to the US FDA with authorization to cross-reference any required <br />potential Subcontractor submissions to enable full review of the manufacturing <br />and testing documents by the US FDA for IND studies.</p>

Description:This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the NAVFACEngineering Service Center (ESC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement isopen until 15 May 2009. NAVFAC ESC is interested in a software based model thatcan be used to analyze the integration of photovoltaic systems, wind energysystems, conventional diesel generation, and energy storage.  The model shouldaddress design issues related to the following: 
.	Renewable energy resources have intermittent availability (e.g., windspeed varies, isolation varies, etc.).  .	Space limitations often restrict energy storage strategies and capacityof RE generation that can be installed.  .	There may be multiple renewable energy systems installed where little orno configuration was made to accommodate future integration and control.  .	Maintaining micro-grid/building-level circuit stability during outage
The purpose of the model includes the following: .	to provide analysis needed to optimize use of photovoltaic (PV) powerand wind power, diesel generation and maintaining stability during outage.	provide analysis of energy storage requirements.	provide an analysis needed to integrate multiple planned/unplanned PVand wind power 
This announcement is for abstracts only and shall be no more than five (5) pagesof technical material.  The abstracts shall outline the topics of interest.  Theabstract may be supplemented by resumes and list of publications relevant tothis announcement which will not count against the five (5) page limit.  Theaward will be for up to $400,000.   Multiple awards may be made under thisannouncement.  Topics of interest described below are provided as guides toareas that must be included in the abstract for the model.  Also, it is expectedthat abstracts will not limit the approach to only these specified in the topiclist.  Individual topics of interest are as follows:
1)	The model will include solar and wind generation, energy storage, andcontrols that isolate the building in event of a power failure, and integraterenewable power with that from diesel back-up emergency generators.  2)	The model will be enhanced by incorporating data from manufacturerperformance data. 3)	The model will provide an analysis of interoperability, performancecharacteristics and financial performance of various integrated renewablesystems and back-up diesel generation.  Measure system response time, firstcost, output, reliability, maintenance and percent load provided.  Test andrecommend strategies to power isolated loads directly from renewable systems,isolate buildings from the grid or control renewable and emergency generatorsvia control systems (e.g., Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems).4)	The model will predict interoperability of distributed, multiple,installation level renewables systems. The results will be used to recommendtechnical guidance for implementation multiple renewable systems through-out aNavy base for maximum benefit.


The software model shall be compatible with running on a MS Windows basedcomputer without having to make non-standard operating system modification(s).Past experience with utilities related computer modeling, renewable energysystems, power generation is desired.

<DESC>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). In accordance with FAR 15.209(c), responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form an agreement of binding contract of any nature.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will not award a contract based on this RFI. All information solicited and received in this Request for Information (RFI), will be treated as information only. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents are advised to not include any confidential business information with a response as the government does not guarantee confidentiality of the information received. The purpose of this RFI is to gather government, industry and public comment from all interested parties. The EPA OPPT is seeking comments, suggestions, recommendations and creative input for the development of a potential solution to manage data and documents, including electronic filings submitted to EPA by the chemical industry under authority of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  Initial focus of the solution shall be for Section 5, New chemicals submissions. More information on TSCA section 5 may be found at: 	http://www.epa.gov/biotech_rule/pubs/submain.htm For a complete description of this RFI please see:http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/0911567/index.htm or http://www.epa.gov/oam/hpod/index.htm#solam
This RFI has been altered to include the following extensions: Questions should be submitted no later than 4:00 EST April 1, 2009; Responses should be submitted no later than 4:00 EST April 10, 2009.
The following Questions and Answers have been posted by the Government:
1.	Question: I was hoping to find out if: MANAGE TOXIC SUBSTANCES SYSTEM FOR NEW CHEMICAL SUBMISSIONS, is a new opportunity or if there was an incumbent. If there is an incumbent on this opportunity could you please provide me with the following information: Award Date: Contract #: Contractor Name: Award Amount: ?	Answer: MTS for New Chemical Submissions is a new opportunity.2.	Question: Is there an anticipated time frame for an RFP release??	Answer: The anticipated time frame for an RFP release is first quarter of fiscal year 20103.	Question: Is there any current case/contract management system in place at MTS? ?	Answer: There is no current case/contract management system in place for MTS4.	Question:  Are they currently using Documentum just as content repository (or) is it integrated in their custom enterprise application? If so, what are the integrations? ?	Answer: Documentum is emerging as a legacy document repository with Captiva scanning interface and both JAVA based and WebTop search routines. 5.	Question: What tools of Documentum are currently in use (Content Server, WebTop, any other?) ?	Answer: See answer to question 4. 6.	Question: Is the Migration of legacy Documents from Oracle to be included in the solution??	Answer: There are no legacy documents in Oracle7.	Question: What is the current scope & volume of external systems/Agencies integration involved in processes (workflows) for reviewing (non confidential) information? ?	Answer: The RFI identifies required system interaction and integration, but the solution should be scalable as indicated in the RFI.8.	Question: Are there any web content management requirements to provide self service to the customers??	Answer: No. 9.	Question: Since scanning is not allowed, what are all the document capture methods (email, web, i.e. is there a requirement to integrate FAX also??	Answer: The document capture methods include receipt of electronic documents through CD and encrypted through CDX. Submission software has been developed by EPA and posted to EPA's web site for industry to download to client machines for preparation, validation and submission by CD or CDX. The solution should be scalable to allow document capture through web forms and web-based applications.10.	Question: With regards to the RFI TSCAQ MTS  attachment entitled  ?MTS New Chemical Submission System Requirement Specification Model Report? dated July 2008, was this report prepared by a vendor or by government personnel, and if by a vendor, is that vendor eligible to respond to this particular requirement??	Answer: The document was prepared by EPA with the assistance of a vendor. That vendor is eligible to respond to this particular requirement.11.	Question: How does EPA like Documentum in general? Are they really willing to move from Documentum to alternatives or is their preference to re-engineer the existing platform to be more efficient/cost effective.?	Answer: Documentum is the standard for records management and document management applications throughout  EPA. The key criteria for any solution is that it will effectively and efficiently receive, process, store, synchronize, provide pre-formatted and triggered responses to submitters, and provide centralized, internal EPA search and report access to regulatory documents submitted by industry or developed internally by EPA scientists and structured data extracted from documents submitted by industry as original submissions or amendments, substantiated by associated scientific studies sometimes comprising thousands of pages in several different formats (e.g., PDF, GIF, MOL, MS Word, etc.). All design options are being considered through a thorough analysis including review of cost-benefit.12.	Question: The RFI suggests that a COTS might be considered. Is it understood that even a COTS will take significant customization to work with multiple platforms and support a variety of workflow interfaces??	Answer: This is understood13.	Question:  Would EPA consider making this contract a small business set aside, 8(a)? ?	Answer: Yes, the EPA will consider this option.14.	Question: Would EPA consider issuing this contract under Alliant SB to reduce the procurement time, giving the agency and selected contractor to get to work quicker on MTS??	Answer: Yes, the EPA will consider this option15.	Question: Is the interface and file management capability to be for in-house use only (ie. PMN Notes) or does it require an interface to replace existing systems for industry submissions??	Answer: See answer to question 9 with regard to interface for industry submissions. The solution which this RFI seeks is to provide the key capability as indicated in the answer to question 11. 16.	Question: Is a browser interface desired??	Answer: Any reasonable interface will be considered17.	Question: By "secured communication between EPA and industry submitters", does this mean receipt/status/etc e-mails?Answer: The secured communication channel between EPA and industry submitters for sending encrypted CBI information between the EPA and industry uses CDX and submission software developed by EPA and posted to EPA's web site for industry download. The solution which this RFI seeks is to provide pre-formatted and triggered responses to submitters regarding their submissions using the secure channel.

<RESPDATE>042909
<CONTACT>Dave Keiss, Sandia Contract Representative, Phone 505 844 3708, Email dmkeiss@sandia.gov
<DESC><p>Background Information: From 1989 to 1993, Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) disposed of approximately 250 tons of Cold War legacy materials through burial in a roughly twelve foot deep unlined trench, now known as the TA-III Classified Waste Landfill, in Sandia&rsquo;s Tech Area III in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Located within a five-acre Limited Area, these burials included classified (up through SRD) weapon components, hardware, and data according to relatively extensive inventory records compiled at the time. Under a pending proposal to the State of New Mexico, New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), Sandia intends to completely excavate and empty the trench, destructively eliminate (demilitarize) the classified characteristics of all retrieved materials in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act and other regulations, process and dispose of all resulting wastes in accordance with current environmental regulations, and finally reseed and restore the site itself. Sandia proposed (Reference 1) five years, beginning in 2011, to complete the project; however, a much earlier start, including a possible start as early as Fiscal Year 2009, and much faster completion, as soon as Fiscal Year 2012 if feasible, would be highly desirable. A range of alternative project execution options were studied to accomplish this work scope and schedule. A recommended path forward is under consideration (Figure 1) which involves performing the excavation, sorting, and repacking the disinterred materials into handling containers locally under tent-like enclosures to provide visual protection of classified materials and prevent windblown loss. These sorted and repacked materials would then be moved into an immediately adjacent, roughly four-acre, Limited Area to the south of the existing landfill site for staging and demilitarization. The demilitarization facility is envisioned as a new, roughly 15,000 gross square foot metal warehouse-style building with a roughly 16 foot minimum internal height. This structure would need to be tailored to the space, security, and safety basis requirements of hosting demilitarization and waste processing/shipping operations. It is envisioned that one side of the building would be reserved for staging and storage of materials awaiting demilitarization or shipment, while the other side would be equipped with a series of internal containment enclosures housing the actual demilitarization workstations. To accommodate the staging and handling of classified materials, this structure would need to be built, equipped, and operated to Vault-Type Room (VTR) standards. To maximize the use of floor space and eliminate the need for maintenance personnel in the VTR, the demilitarization workstation enclosures would be ducted and exhausted to external Local Exhaust and Ventilation (LEV) systems, including high efficiency dust collector filtration systems, DOE-qualified HEPA filtration systems, exhaust fans, and exhaust stacks. To maximize the safety of all operations, the same approach would be applied to all building HVAC systems and to charging stations for electric forklifts and other equipment. To support shipping functions, the facility will need be equipped with overhead vehicle doors and sealed concrete floors designed to support heavy equipment. Finally, the facility would need to be equipped with office space, restrooms, break area, locker room and showers, and safety showers. Site improvements to support this demilitarization approach would necessarily include the Limited Area boundary and security infrastructure, as well as a small gravel parking area for the workforce. In addition, the need to reliably meet potential NMED-imposed schedule requirements will likely drive the need for up to forty shipping containers, equipped to serve as VTR storage, to accommodate the surge resulting from the initial excavation and sorting process. These storage units would be added only as required to accommodate the surge and would be emptied and eliminated as quickly as the demilitarization pace would allow. Sandia desires to assess the level of interest, if any, from potentially qualified commercial teams in accomplishing the Remediation of Sandia&rsquo;s TA-III Classified Waste Landfill. The Probable Scope of Work to be addressed is defined below, along with a draft set of Mandatory Qualifications that would be used to define potentially qualified teams, if any. Sandia seeks expressions of potential interest from potentially qualified teams who would potentially be interested in pursuing the full Probable Scope of Work as defined. Other project approaches suggested by potential qualified vendors which satisfy the site remediation and material demilitarization goals will be considered. Probable Scope of Work: With regard to facilities construction, provide all materials, workforce, capabilities, construction financing, and other resources required to execute completion of all necessary site improvements, facilities, and infrastructure as described above, including the procurement and outfitting of any temporary shipping container VTR staging facilities required to meet any operational surge from the excavation and sorting processes. With regard to excavation and sorting requirements, provide all required excavation and sorting equipment, supplies, expertise, and workforce including Q-cleared personnel, to accomplish these tasks in a manner that fully meets all potential environmental, safety, security requirements. With regard to demilitarization and waste disposition requirements, provide all required demilitarization equipment, supplies, and expertise, including Q-cleared workforce, to accomplish these tasks in a manner that fully meets all potential environmental, safety, security requirements. Potentially qualified teams should have relevant experience, through either employees or subcontractors who would be assigned to the project, in: 1. The planning, design, engineering, construction financing, and completion of site improvements, facilities, and infrastructure of similar complexity and scale to those described above. 2. Site or facilities remediation and restoration efforts, including excavation followed by restoration of surface contours and native plantscapes, of similar complexity and scale to those described above. 3. The handling, demilitarization, and disposition of classified materials, including weapon components, hardware, and data, as well as the resulting wastes in efforts of similar complexity and scale to those described above. 4. Dealing with the potential for hazardous materials, Special Nuclear Materials, explosives, or liquids and with the potential for hazardous, mixed, and low-level radioactive waste products. Potentially qualified teams should have the capability to obtain all necessary financing and resources and initiate work in FY09. All interested parties are invited to contact Dave Keiss, Contracting Representative for Sandia National Laboratories, at the following email address if they would like to be included on a bid list for a Request for Quotation for this requirement when it is published: dmkeiss@sandia.gov Please provide a brief response detailing your previous work experience in the four areas listed above and describe your ability to obtain the necessary financing and resources to perform this work. If you intend on providing a quotation response based on a team of bidders, please include a brief description of each team member and their area of expertise. Please send the required information to Dave Keiss no later than the close of business on April 28, 2009. The following two attachments are very lengthy and could not be included on this site.

<DESC>This is a notice of the Coast Guard's intent to solicit for the purchase of VHF Radios under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 6.302-1.  The purchase will include a brand name specification for Motorola Quantar radios.  The Government has determined that the use of a brand name specification is essential to the Government's requirements.

The US Coast Guard, Rescue 21 Project Resident Office Alaska (PRO AK) has an immediate requirement to purchase four (4) Motorola Quantar VHF radio sets that are directly compatible with existing Motorola Quantars, Motorola Digital Interface Units, Motorola ASTRO modems and Motorola CENTRACOM Gold Elite series dispatch console systems.  No other manufacturer's product is known to be "plug-in" compatible with the Coast Guard's existing Motorola inventories.  These radios will be used in the Rescue 21 PRO AK test lab in Douglas Alaska and tested for potential continued use through out the area of operations.

This notice is not a request for quotations.  An RFQ will be issued at a later date.  This notice constitutes public notice of the Government's intent to use a brand name specification.  Comments regarding this notice shall be provided in writing to the Contracting Officer, via e-mail, no later than 2:00 p.m. AST, Wednesday, April 22, 2009.

<DESC>This announcement resulted with at least six (6) awards being made on a combination of Small Business Set-Aside and Unrestricted basis. It was the intent of the Government to initially award four (4) contracts from the Unrestricted selection and two (2) from the Small-Business Set-Aside. The Unrestricted basis was open to all interested parties regardless of business size. The Small Business size standard is a maximum of $4.5 million of average annual receipts for its preceding 3 fiscal years. All firms responding to this solicitation MUST identify in which category they are submitting. All firms must state the words (UNRESTRICTED) or (SMALL BUSINESS) after the solicitation number in PART I, A. Block 3 of form SF 330. A separate response (SF 330) MUST be submitted for each category in which the firm wants consideration. No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation. Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract. Work under this contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders, with the total IDC contract value not to exceed $10,000,000 for Unrestricted basis over the five-year life of the contract and $5,000,000 for Small-Business Set-Aside over the five-year life of the contract. A firm fixed price contract will be negotiated. Contracts awarded will not exceed a term of five years. Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract. Selection of A-E firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional qualifications necessary for the performance of the required services. All interested Architect-Engineers are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. If a large business is selected for this contract, the firm will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan during contract negotiation. The subcontracting goals for this contract are as follows: a minimum of 70.0% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB), 6.2% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), 7.0% be placed with women-owned small businesses (WOSB), 9.8% be placed with HUB Zone small business, 3.0% be placed with Veteran-Owned Small Business, (VOSB), and 0.9% be placed with Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). If the selected firm intends to submit a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale in the plan why the above goals can not be met. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330. PROJECT INFORMATION: The selected firm will be required to perform a broad range of engineering services to satisfy fluctuating needs and conditions.

<DESC>The overall purpose of this procurement is to acquire Marine Corps Systems Command (MarCorSysCom)-certified wool Overcoats for MFR designated personnel. The Marine Corps uniform specifications have been established by MarCorSysCom to ensure that uniform items conform to any and all Marine Corps requirements.  Vendors shall comply with strict quality and uniformity standards in order to earn and maintain certification as an authorized supplier for Marine Corps uniform items.  Program Management for individual clothing items falls under the Individual Combat Equipment Branch within MarCorSysCom.  Pursuant to MARADMIN 072/06, the subject wool Overcoat may only be ordered commercially through certified vendors, at this time only Neptune Garment Company ("Neptune") of Boston, Massachusetts has been certified and authorized to manufacture the wool Overcoat to the specifications established by MarCorSysCom.
This acquisition is proposed to be made using other than full & open competition based on the availability of only one certified responsible source.  The contemplated acquisition is for the purchase of Marine Corps-specific wool overcoats ("Overcoat") to be utilized at MFR locations where harsh winter weather justifies its use for ceremonial details and color guard. The subject Overcoat is of limited production and is currently authorized for wear by only the Marines at Marine Barracks 8th & "I" and units performing ceremonial details and color guards. MFR requested, and received approval from the Commandant of the Marine Corps to acquire and authorize wear of the Overcoat for designated MFR personnel conducting these functions.

<AWDNBR>N62645-09-P-2114
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
	FOR OTHER THAN
	FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Identify the agency and contracting activity.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC), Fort Detrick, MD, on behalf of the Navy and DoD Drug Testing Program Offices.

2.  Nature/description of action/contract type.

This action is for the award of a firm fixed priced contract on an other than full and open competition basis to Spark Holland, for a Symbiosis Pharma instrument. 

3.  Description of supplies/services.

The Navy and DoD Drug Testing Program Offices have a requirement for a Symbiosis Pharma instrument to be used by the military drug testing laboratory, Navy Drug Screening Lab (NDSL) San Diego, for development of a totally automated solid-phase extraction (SPE) method. 

4.  Identification of statutory authority.

The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source as implemented by paragraph 6.302-1(c) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  

5.  Demonstration of contractor's unique qualifications.
Spark Holland is the only supplier of an entirely automated solid-phase extraction instrument. It is unique in nature, and automates the SPE process for the extraction of drugs of abuse prior to LC-MS-MS analysis.  The automated method saves time and manpower, completely automating a manual process that requires manual label transfers and is hence vulnerable to human error.  Automating processes reduces the possibility of errors and improves forensic integrity of the testing process.  There is no other company in the current analytical chemistry market that supplies an online extraction device that is automated and elimiates the need for human interference.

An automated system decreases errors due to manual interference and therefore is better relied upon in court cases.  The Spark Holland System has been proven to work with the LC-MS-MS instrument that is already installed at NDSL. This validation is both time consuming and costly.  Not only is the Spark Holland the only available automated system, but duplicating the validation testing with any other company would increase cost tremendously. The San Diego lab has dedicated significant time and resources for over two years to validate and test this equipment.

6.  GPE announcement/potential sources.

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
5.201, an announcement will be posted on Fedbizopps (http://www.fbo.gov) 

7.  Determination of fair and reasonable cost.

At the time of award, the Contracting Officer will make a determination that the award price is fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.

8.  Description of market survey.

Representatives from the NDSL San Diego have been looking at the market for this technology since 2000.  They have attended the trade show PITTCON each year and have talked to vendors.  Their extensive research has found that no other vendor has a completely automated system that integrates with the LC.

9.  Any other supporting facts.

NDSL San Diego, in support of the DoD Drug Testing Program, has committed to this line of automation research and has already developed and validated forensic drug testing analyses on a previous version of the Symbiosis Pharma instrument. This validation is both expensive and time consuming which further increases costs.
	
10.  Listing of interested sources.

Currently no other sources will be solicited.  All inquires received in response to FedBizOpps announcement will be considered.

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition.

See numbers 6 and 10 above.
 

12.  Statement of delivery requirements.

The equipment shall be delivered by April 2009.  It is estimated that one instrument at $176,000 will be required for NDSL San Diego, CA.


13.  Total estimated dollar value of the acquisition covered by this J&A, with funding specified by year and appropriation.

$176,000.00 from FY09 OP funds 


14.  Reference to the approved acquisition plan.

An Acquisition Plan is not required for this procurement under 
the criteria and thresholds established by DFARS 207.103(B).

	
15.  Documentation for spare/repair parts acquisitions.

Not applicable.
