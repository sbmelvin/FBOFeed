3) Add contractor logistics support for the new ACT pods and three years of contractor logistics support of the existing URITS assets.

This contract action is contemplated to be sole source based on the fact that URITS was specifically developed for USAFE.

The new pods shall be fully compatible with the existing URITS, including hardware and software interfaces such as the Data Transfer Devices (DTDs) and Datalink capability.  In addition, the new pods shall have system Certification and Accreditation mandated by the Chief Staff of the Air Force.

The primary purpose of this action is to provide small business access to acquisition information and enhance competition by identifying contracting and subcontracting activities.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division intends to award a sole source modification to Outstart, Inc., located at 89 South Street, 8th Floor Lincoln Plaza, Boston, MA 01760, to the existing NILARS commercial IQC N61339-02-D-0006.  The purpose of this modification is to provide for the possibility to order forty Evolution LCMS software stand alone client applications, its associated licenses, stand alone user training, the maintenance and support of those licenses as well as two hundred hours of technical support services on the existing NILARS commercial IQC.  The stand-alone client application is an extension of Outstart's Evolution software and resides on a client computer.  It contains the authoring portion of the parent installation of Evolution software server application.  The stand-alone client application enables assembly of courses at a remote client location with periodic connection to a network (versus constant connection to a network) for the purpose of exchanging learning and media objects with the Evolution database, and/or posting of learning objects or courses for review.  Outstart Incorporated is the sole proprietary owner of the Evolution LCMS software and as such has produced and owns the programming code necessary for the two parts of the application to operate together as one system.  Outstart personnel are the only source which provide both the training and annual maintenance and support for the stand-alone client applications as well as the technical support services for the Evolution LCMS software.  This is not a request for quotation, nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  This contract modification will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The General Accounting Office (GAO) will shortly publish Volume V of PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW, second edition--also known as "The Red Book."  Volume V consists of a comprehensive index and tables of authority covering all of the preceding four volumes.  Volume V completes the second edition of GAO's PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW. 

GAO will provide one copy of this volume to the heads of federal agencies.  Agencies may place advance (rider) orders for additional copies of this volume with their account representatives at the Government Printing Office (GPO).  

This notice is not intended to solicit orders from the general public for single copies or small orders of this volume.  GPO will offer volume V for sale to the general public at a later time.

Rider orders for Volume V should be placed on a Standard Form 1 and should specify GAO Requisition No. 200061.  Agency orders for Volume V must be received by GPO no later than August 1, 2002. Rider requisitions for Volume V will not be accepted after this date, and additional copies will have to be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents.  All rider requisitions must be submitted to GPO through each agency's Washington, D.C. headquarters printing procurement office.  We are advised that GPO will return all requisitions sent directly from field or regional offices.

In compiling your agency's total order, GAO suggests that you take into consideration the needs of legal offices, finance offices, contracting offices, libraries, Inspector General offices, field and regional offices, and any other elements of your agency that might use this publication.

Unlike the previous four volumes of this series, Volume V of PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW will be printed in the ?perfect-bound? format.  Consequently, it will not require a binder.

Questions relating to this notice should be directed to Neill Martin-Rolsky (202-512-8580; MartinRolskyN@gao.gov)

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  Reference RFI02AP0002 when responding to this announcement. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking vendors who can provide a mainframe-based output distribution tool to route print to TCP-IP devices.  In addition, SSA seeks a solution for its Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) document printing needs.  SSA has a complex, multi-protocol network (SSANET).  For years, SSA has successfully used, and continues to use, VPS as its output distribution tool for printing to Systems Network Architecture (SNA) based printers. With the recent implementation of TCP/IP for OS/390, SSA now has a requirement to route print output from mainframe-based applications to TCP/IP-connected devices.  The specific requirements include: Data stream conversion support No restriction of the number of TCP/IP devices defined Ability to send output directly to TCP/IP devices supporting a sockets connection. Advanced error recovery and notification is a must.  SSA requires bi-directional communication between the output facility and printers.  The print system needs to be able to receive acknowledgments and error codes from the printers (i.e., forms jam, paper out, etc.) and also to support checkpoint/restart. Compatibility with IBM?s OS/390 TCP/IP stack Ability to support the definition of additional printers without the need to update JES3 definitions.  This, in turn, eliminates the need to re-IPL each time a new printer needs to be defined and activated. No need to install and maintain server based components?only a mainframe based software solution is sought. Ability to print Advanced Function Presentation (AFP) output on TCP-IP network printers without needing SIMM Chips in the network printer. Provides a mainframe-based, full screen menu-driven user interface. Ability to electronically store forms on the mainframe eliminating the need for special forms residing on dedicated printers. Provides a management facility which allows authorized personnel to view the status of controlled printers and output; and provides the ability to start, stop, cancel, and manipulate the JES queue through a mainframe-based facility. The software and all related deliverables must be compatible with SSA?s requirements for Section 508 compliance, which are available online at http://www.ssa.gov/oag; then click on acquisition information and scroll down the page to Section 508.   More information on Section 508, is available at the official website: http://www.section508.gov. Responses must contain sufficient documentation to establish a potential capability to fulfill the requirement, as far as has been specified in this announcement. Closing Date for this submission is 15 calendar days from the date of this notice.  No FAXED responses will be accepted.  Respondents will NOT be notified of the results of ANY evaluation made from the information submitted.  NO award will be made from the basis of this announcement.  The information will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources.  NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  The Government will NOT pay for information provided in response to this announcement.  Interested parties should contact the POC identified above.

Second UPS system:  manufactured by Liebert model UDA63225A27A083 Serial # C250419-20548; battery:  Johnson Controls model UPS12-475 (2) strings of 40.  Request For Quote # TIRMS-03-Q-00001 is a request for quotation incorporating FAR provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 01-07.   The NAICS Code is 811310 and the size standard is $6.0 million (gross revenues averaged over the past three years).  This procurement is 100% set-aside for Small Business concerns and all qualified responsible sources may submit a quote.  The IRS plans to make award to the responsible, responsive Small Business vendor whose quote conforms to this solicitation and whose quote is determined to be the best overall value to the Government.  The IRS intends to issue a Purchase Order for the estimated base year of October 1, 2002 - September 30, 2003 with four (4) additional twelve-month option periods for an estimated total of 60 months of service.  All interested sources are instructed to provide a firm-fixed price for each of the Contract Line Items (CLINS) indicating the monthly price per machine, yearly total for each machine, and overall Grand Total for the award (including options) as well as provide a separate written presentation describing (a) company overview, (b) relevant past experience, (c) a minimum of three current references (including mailing address and point of contact's name, phone/fax numbers, and e-mail address), and (d) technical capabilities of meeting the needs of the IRS as set forth in the Statement of Work.  Verification that the company is classified as a Small Business and conforms to the size standard is also required.  The Government will evaluate both the written presentation and the price quote and make award to the vendor determined to be the best overall value to the Government with significantly more weight placed on the written presentation than the price quote.  It should be noted that evaluation of options shall in no way obligate the Government to exercise the options.  Quotes submitted should be the best effort of the vendor as revisions may not be allowed or requested.  It is recommended that all interested sources register at this time in the Central Contractor Registration database found at www.ccr.gov as the IRS can only make award to vendors in that database.  (Instructions and additional information about this may be found at that website.)  Requests for a copy of RFQ # TIRMS-03-Q-00001 and the Statement of Work should be e-mailed to Tina Greene at kristina.l.greene@irs.gov.  If e-mail is not available to the vendor, then the request may be faxed to 972-308-1928 instead.  No telephone requests will be honored.  The RFQ and other information will be distributed via e-mail starting on or about July 12, 2002 unless the vendor requests another method.  One copy of the price quote as well as two copies of the separate written presentations are due by 4:30 p.m. CST, Thursday, August 1, 2002 via e-mail, fax, or postal service.

<SUBJECT>B--CONDUCT A STUDY ENTITLED "A CHARACTERIZATION OF HARDBOTTOM HABITATS NEAR OCS STRUCTURES AND FACILITIES IN THE PACIFIC OCS REGION - SYNTHESIZED FROM EXISTING BIOLOGICAL AND FACILITY SURVEYS, GIS BASEMAPS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES."
<SOLNBR>1435-01-02-RP-85283

<CONTACT>DEBRA HOFFMAN, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, FAX 703-787-1009
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract to conduct a study entitled "A Characterization of Hardbottom Habitats near OCS Structures and Facilities in the Pacific OCS Region - Synthesized from Existing Biological and Facility Surveys, GIS Basemaps, and Environmental Studies." This study will synthesize existing data and information, held by MMS, in order to generate a written report and ArcView/ArcInfo GIS compatible data layers that describe the characteristics and relative importance of known hardbottom sites within two miles of Pacific OCS structures. Existing information and data include, but are not limited to, biological and facility surveys, videotapes, written reports, slides, paper maps, recent and historical studies contracted by MMS, and MMS ArcView GIS basemaps. ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT: The government estimates a period of performance for this contract of twelve (12) months and a cost range of between $80,000 to $120,000. BACKGROUND: The MMS defines decommissioning as the process of ending oil, gas, or sulfur operations and returning the lease or pipeline right-of-way to a condition that meets the requirements of the regulations. Decommissioning of oil and gas facilities can potentially cause adverse impacts to hardbottom habitats. Current technology available for platform removal includes bulk explosives, shaped explosive charges, mechanical cutters, and underwater arc cutters. Vessels and equipment used to remove platforms, pipelines, and power cables are often massive and require multiple anchors with multiple deployment. Challenges lie ahead for the structure removals from the Pacific OCS, particularly for the large platforms and pipeline segments located in deep water. MMS will conduct detailed environmental reviews of any proposed decommissioning projects to ensure that operations minimize impacts to hardbottom habitats. To better accomplish those reviews, MMS needs to know the characteristics and relative importance of hardbottom sites near existing Pacific OCS structures. A large information base exists on hard substrate distribution and abundance within the Southern California Planning Area. Nearly 200 videotapes, written reports, slides, and maps have been generated from biological surveys alone. Additional information has come from surveys of pipeline and power cable corridors and platform jackets. Although MMS has this information we do not have a compiled synthesis, either written or in GIS compatible data layers, of the characteristics and relative importance of known hardbottom sites near existing OCS structures. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: This study will (1) review existing information and GIS basemaps to determine which hardbottom sites are applicable and which data are relevant; (2) evaluate relevant data and determine specific characteristics and relative importance for each hardbottom site; and (3) synthesize the data into a descriptive report and ArcView/ArcInfo GIS compatible data layers for hardbottom sites near OCS structures. SCOPE OF WORK: TASK 1. INFORMATION ACQUISITION AND REVIEW -- The Contractor shall make arrangements to acquire existing information and GIS basemaps on hardbottom sites and OCS structures from MMS, POCSR, Camarillo, CA. Likely information and data sources include biological and facility surveys, videotapes, written reports, slides, and paper maps, GIS referenced ArcView data and maps of existing OCS structures and hardbottom sites, and reports from recent and historical studies contracted by MMS. The Contractor shall review the acquired information and determine which hardbottom sites and data are relevant in order to generate a descriptive report and GIS compatible data layers of the characteristics and relative importance of hardbottom sites within two miles of OCS structures. The contractor shall include in the Synthesis Report (TASK 3) the specific source(s) of the information, e.g., biological or facility survey, videotape, written report, slide, paper map and/or GIS basemap, used to determine which hardbottom sites and data are relevant. TASK 2. EVALUATION OF RELEVANT DATA AND DETERMINATION OF SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RELATIVE IMPORTANCE FOR EACH HARDBOTTOM SITE -- Using the relevant information, the Contractor shall evaluate the data and determine, as far as possible, specific descriptive characteristics and relative importance for each relevant hardbottom site. Descriptive hardbottom characteristics shall include, but not be limited to, size, vertical relief, dominant phyla, biological community, and keystone species, and substrate type such as rock, clay, scattered boulders, etc. Relative importance shall include, but not be limited to, considerations of scarcity of like sites, value as habitat for species of scientific or commercial interest, and potential sensitivity to disturbances such as turbidity. If a hardbottom site is large or complex enough to include more than one category of vertical relief, the Contractor shall also determine, as far as possible, the percentage of the relief categories present. The contractor shall include in the Synthesis Report (TASK 3) the specific source(s) of the information, e.g., biological or facility survey, videotape, written report, slide, paper map and/or GIS basemap, used to determine specific descriptive characteristics for each hardbottom site. TASK 3. DATA SYNTHESIS, REPORT, AND GIS COMPATIBLE DATA LAYERS -- Using the relevant data from TASK 1 and determinations through TASK 2, the Contractor shall synthesize the information into a report of the characteristics and relative importance of hardbottom sites near OCS structures. The Contractor shall report the location of hardbottom sites relative to OCS structures. Existing platforms will be referenced by name e.g., Platform Harmony. Pipelines will be referenced as to size, transported product, and origin and termination, e.g., 20-inch oil, Platform Harmony to Las Flores Canyon, or 12-inch gas, Platform Harmony to Platform Hondo. Power cables will be referenced as to size and origin and termination e.g., 6-inch, Las Flores Canyon to Platform Heritage. The contractor shall evaluate and synthesize the acquired information, interpret the results, and generate tables, graphics, and ArcView/ArcInfo GIS data layers as needed to fulfill the objectives and indicate the geographic location of hardbottom sites and OCS structures. The geographic data shall be expressed in latitude/longitude Datum NAD 27 and shall be compatible with the MMS TIMS CORIS data structure. A final decision on information to be mapped and its format shall be determined by the Contractor in consultation with the COTR and the MMS Information Technology Division. HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing Capabilities Statements by COB, July 30, 2002 Detailing: (1) Your key personnel, scientific and technical, (those who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project) with their qualifications and specific expertise and experience.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), of the National Institute of  Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is recompeting and expanding their current contract with the Baylor College of Medicine, Contract No. N01-AI-65298.  This solicitation will be a full and open competition, NAICS Code 541710, 500 employees.   

This RFP solicits proposals for reference laboratories to support the infection prevention program of the Respiratory Diseases Branch, DMID.  The Government has a need to continue this effort and expand reference laboratory support as part of the Bio-defense Research Agenda.  The focus of these laboratories will be the development of reagents and biological assays for bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens.  The Respiratory Pathogens Research Reference Laboratories will be part of a coordinated, interactive, multi-disciplinary network to help support the development of vaccines and drugs against respiratory pathogens, including those that present concerns for bio-defense and/or emerging infections. 

Separate proposals are solicited for separate parts of this solicitation:  Part A - Bacterial Respiratory Pathogens Reference Laboratory and Part B - Viral Respiratory Reference Laboratory.   An offeror may respond to either Part A or Part B, or both.  It is anticipated that a total of two contracts will be awarded to successful offerors demonstrating capability of responding to the requirements of this solicitation. It is anticipated that two (2) cost-reimbursement, completion-type contracts will be awarded for a period of seven (7) years at an estimated level of effort 3.5 FTEs for each year (Part A) and 2.25 FTEs for each year (Part B).  These Bacterial and Viral Research Reference Laboratories will provide a resource facility with a major effort on reagent and assay development, including distribution of procedures and reagents, for the measurement of the human immune response to targeted respiratory pathogens.  

The Part A reference laboratory will focus on improvement and/or development of biological assays important for studying bacterial respiratory and relevant neonatal infections as well as related vaccines (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, group A streptococcus (GAS), group B streptococcus (GBS), Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Burkholderia cepacia.).  The contract will provide a resource for assays and reagents, such as antigens, standard reference sera, and quality control samples and serve as a repository for their storage and distribution.  Further, analytical methods will be developed, evaluated, and validated to accurately compare immunogenicity results within and between laboratories for different vaccines.   

The Part B reference laboratory will focus on improvement and/or development of biological assays important for studying viral respiratory and relevant neonatal infections as well as related vaccines (e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses).  The contract will provide a resource for assays and reagents, such as antigens, standard reference sera, and quality control samples and serve as a repository for their storage and distribution.  Further, analytical methods will be developed, evaluated, and validated to accurately compare immunogenicity results within and between laboratories for different vaccines.  


Once awarded, the Respiratory Pathogens Reference Laboratories will become a part of a multi-disciplinary Respiratory Pathogens Research Network (RPPN).  This network  will include contracts for Respiratory Pathogens Research Units that support basic and clinical research involving bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens.  The Respiratory Pathogens Research Units will be awarded through a separate solicitation entitled ?Basic and Clinical Approaches to Controlling Human Respiratory Pathogens?, RFP-NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-05 that is also posted at this time.  

RFP-NIH-DMID-03-37, will be available electronically on the CMB Homepage on or about July 16, 2002, may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and will be posted on Fed Biz Opps:   www.fedbizopps.gov.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plans to issue an order on a sole source basis to the Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). The tasks to be performed under this purchase order are as follows: 1) implement the proposed model for the problem of monotectic solidification during vertical directional solidification, 2) generate the geometry files and the parameter input files for an axisymmetric Fidap algorithm, 3) perform calculations to determine the effect of shear flow on the solute transport for the directional solidification of the aluminum-indium monotectic system, 4) evaluate the feasibility of a model based on the mechanism of a pressure-driven flow generated by the dynamic Laplace-Young boundary conditions at the L1-L2 interface, and 5) produce a technical report detailing the results of the work.
The Binghamton University is the only source for this service as they have personnel who are uniquely qualified to perform the needed calculations and evaluations of the influence of convection on rod spacing in monotectic alloys. Professor Murray of the University has extensive experience on this topic and has authored papers that form the basis of the proposed work. He is especially experienced in application of the mathematics of crystal growth equations with convective effects; particularly in the use of computational fluid dynamics software to model flow in monotectic systems. The period of performance will be twelve (12) months from the date of award. The anticipated award date of this order is on or about 6 days from the date of this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. Interested persons may identify their intent and capability to respond to the requirement no later than the response date above. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For information, call the POC identified below.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plans to issue an order on a sole source basis to the George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). The objective of this requirement is to provide the following tasks: 1) provide a technical report detailing investigations on the analysis and computation of a diffuse interface model for solidification coupled with hydrodynamics, 2) a thermodynamically-consistent phase-field model for a binary alloy that incorporates the effects of fluid flow, and 3) the morphological stability of a binary alloy in the context of this phase-field model and compare to the predictions of a sharp-interface model. The George Mason University is the only source for these services as they have personnel uniquely qualified to perform the needed calculations and evaluations of hydrodynamic effects during solidification. The University has extensive experience in this topic and has authored papers that form the basis of the proposed work. The faculty is experienced in the application of the mathematics of crystal growth equations with convective effects, particularly in the application of diffuse interface theories to this subject. The period of performance will be twelve (12) months from the date of award. The anticipated award date of this order is on or about 6 days from the date of this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. Interested persons may identify their intent and capability to respond to the requirement no later than the response date above. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For information, call the POC identified below.

The proposed contractor, the incumbent under contract Delivery Order N01-ES-15459, will engage in an expansion of work currently being conducted thereunder in support of the Community Outreach and Resource Center (COEP).   Specifically, the contractor will undertake  database development, development of a web-based form that allows participating centers to electronically submit, review, and modify annual reports, and development of a web-based form that allows participating centers to electronically submit center news items and meeting information for the Core Center Program, of which COEP is a part.  Because of this interactive and closely related nature of the two distinct but associated efforts, the expansion of work as described above will be minimal.  Therefore, the Government does not anticipate negotiations with any other source.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The C-141 Directorate has a sole source requirement to provide engineering support for a suitable substitute display unit (DU).  The source is Honeywell Intl CAGE 017N4.  The flat panel C-141 Control Display System (CDS) Display Unit (DU), is the predominate instrument used to display flight information to the pilots.  The current DU contains obsolete parts.  The fielded DU?s glass is obsolete.  This requirement covers the efforts required to evaluate and qualify a suitable substitute DU.   These efforts involve engineering support to provide engineering analysis of the proposed unit that is logistically supportable and useable as a suitable substitute for DUs requiring glass repair or replacement; provide a prototype replacement kit; and provide and/or support qualification of the retrofit DU for use in the aircraft.   The C-141C will be used as the primary host aircraft for flight certification.   The contractor shall provide documentation that reflects the commercial and military specifications under which the substitute DU has been, or could be, qualified for use in aircraft.  The substitute DU shall meet, or have met, the same environmental testing requirements as the fielded DU. Primary emphasis shall be on safety and environmental requirements.  The contractor shall provide a retrofit upgrade / repair kit that can be used by depot personnel to repair a DU with damaged glass.  The contractor shall provide technical data, to include technical order source data and drawing packages or drawing changes, needed to repair and convert an existing DU to the substitute.

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on July 15, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>Provide the US Department of Energy with all labor, equipment, tools, supplies, materials and vehicles necessary to perform SF6 gas leak detection services at various Western Area Power Administration sub-stations located in 15 western states.  The geographic area where services are to be performed range from California to Minnesota (west to east) and North Dakota to Arizona (north to south).  Due to security regulations, a listing of sub-stations and their locations where services are required cannot be provided.  Sub-stations in these geographic areas are administered by four regional maintenance offices located as follows;  Sierra Nevada Region (Folsom, California), Desert Southwest Region (Phoenix, Arizona), Rocky Mountain Region (Loveland, Colorado) and Upper Great Plains Region (Billings, Montana).  Satellite (field) maintenance offices further divide each of these Regions.  The SF6 equipment consists of insulated breakers and switchgear, with voltages ranging from 500kV to 34.5kV.  There are 1 to 90 items of SF6 equipment located at each sub-station.  It is estimated that up to 100 breakers and interrupters per year may need to be scanned.  The number of sub-stations to be visited is approximately 50 per year.  Travel time to a sub-station is estimated to range from 1 to 10 hours over dirt roads that are subject to muddy and slick conditions.  A four-wheel drive vehicle may be required depending on weather conditions.  Upon arrival at the site, the contractor will scan for SF6 gas leaks and have personnel and equipment capable of detecting gas leaks down to a minimum of two pounds per year.  The contractor will provide written and video documentation of scan results.  A single requirements type contract is contemplated consisting of a one-year basic performance period with two option years.  For informational purposes, the North American Industrial Classification Code is 541620 and the size standard is $6.0 million.  It is estimated that the solicitation will be available on or about July 19, 2002. Telephone requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site listed below for the actual release date of the solicitation and any amendments.  Copies of the solicitation and amendment(s) will be made available by downloading from the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) home page located at: http://www.pr.doe.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Work consists of providing all labor, supplies, materials, supervision, transportation, equipment, and all else necessary to complete Repair Primary Distribution, Airfield/Munition at Seymour Johnson AFB, NC.  The work involved includes, but is not limited to: investigating the status of raceway system, replacing existing 15 kV underground power cables, installing new concrete encased duct bank with two 4-inch conduits, and updating aerial circuits.  A firm-fixed price contract award is contemplated.
This action is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns.  Interested HUBZone small business concerns should indicate interest to the Contracting Officer, in writing, as early as possible but not later than 5 calendar days of this notice.  As a minimum the following information is required:  (a) a copy of the certificate issued by SBA of your qualifications as a HUBZone concern; (b) a positive statement of your intention to bid on this contract as a prime contractor; (c) evidence of the recency and experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contacts and telephone numbers; (d) evidence of bonding capability to the maximum magnitude of the project to include both single and aggregate totals.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on availability of interested and qualified HUBZone concerns.  Failure to submit all information requested will result in a contractor not being considered as an interested and qualified HUBZone concern.  A decision on whether this requirement will be pursued as a HUBZone small business set-aside or on an unrestricted basis will be posted on EPS within 2 calendar days after the 5 calendar days have expired.
The project magnitude is estimated between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 235310 with a small business size standard of $12,000,000.00.   
The successful contractor will be selected using Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures, resulting in the Best Value to the Government. Past performance is significantly more important than price.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 25 June 02 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.eps.gov.  Paper copies will not be available. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. It is anticipated that the following viewers will be needed to view the solicitation:  Microsoft Word (.doc), Adobe Acrobat Reader (.pdf), WinZip (.zip or .exe.), MaxView/SourceView.exe, Audocad.  More information concerning these viewers can be found on the EPS website.  Note:  Any prospective contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number from Dun and Bradstreet.  Registration may take up to three weeks to process.  Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award.  Primary POC is Lt P. Matt Hazlinsky at (919) 722-5409; email: peter.hazlinsky@seymourjohnson.af.mil.

<DESC>Provide complete sequence of aflatoxin biosynthetic gene cluster from 5 isolates of Apsedrgillus with an accuracy better than 1 error per 2000 pb (99.95%).  The sequence is between 65 and 75 KB.  ARS will provide high quality genomic DNA sequence information derived from a single aflatoxin producing strain.  Sequence information is available for all genes in the cluster, as well as, most non-coding regions.  Sequence is available for both ends and the middle of the cluster.  The contractor will develop the necessary cloning strategy to separate the required sequence from other sequences, carry out the sequencing with sufficient coverage to provide the requisite accuracy, and perform sequence assembly.  Finally, the contractor will provide the sequence in the format accessible to common databases, such as Genbank.  Contractor will provide: 1) Cosmid, fosmid or BAC genomic libraries for each isolate. 2) Isolate clones from these libraries containing the entire 75 kb aflatoxin biosynthetic cluster using known sequence information for comparison. 3) Shotgun subclone form the socmid clones. 4) Sequence subclones to at least 6X coverage to provide sequence accuracy of >99.95%. 5) Assemble sequences from subclones. 6) Provide sequence in database accessible format.  We would prefer a strategy based on cloning and shotgun sequencing.  However, other strategies (i.e. long range PCR with high fidelity polymerase) will be considered.

Statement of Work--(A) Introduction: The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has a requirement to conduct a Records Management Program in accordance with the requirements set forth in the following documents:  44 United States Code 21, 29, 21 and 33; Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter XII, Subchapter B, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Publications.  The purpose of this Statement of Work is to solicit contractor support to perform specific tasks and duties that will ensure that the FEC satisfies these requirements to the fullest extent possible.  (B) Background--FEC Headquarters is located at 999 E Street NW, Washington DC 20463.  The Federal Election Commission consists of approximately 350 employees.  The FEC generates both hardcopy and electronic records but the hardcopy records constitute the official recordkeeping copy.  Most records are filed either at or near the employee's office/workstation in individual file cabinets or, when necessary, sent to the Washington Records Center for immediate storage.  (C) Definitions--(1) Disposition:  An action that removes a record from retention by the FEC because it is no longer needed for current agency operations/business.  Disposition of all records must be approved by NARA and may consist of actions such as the destruction, the deletion, and the shipment of records to a records center or directly to NARA for permanent retention.  (2) General Records Schedule:  A document that lists all FEC records not listed in the NARA's General Records Schedule.  This document consists of NARA approved records schedules and provides instructions for what to do with records that are no longer needed for current agency operations/business.  It is also called records disposition schedule, record control schedule, records retention schedule, or schedule.  (3) Record:  All books, papers, maps, photographs, machine-readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government because of the informational value of data in them. (4) 
Unscheduled Record:  A record whose final disposition has not been approved by NARA.  (D) Scope of Work--Work will be performed within the main office of the FEC at 999 E Street NW, Washington DC 20463.  The Contractor will provide all the personnel, expertise, materials, and services necessary to successfully perform the contract.  The approach/methodology to be used to accomplish this Statement of Work is to be the methodology that will be the most effective and economically feasible for the FEC.  Proposals for this effort should clearly show the methodology and the proposed cost structure and the Contractor's plans for accomplishing this effort.  E.

(b) Preparing disposition guides; (c) Reviewing nonrecords and preparing them for removal from the applicable offices.

The required rework does not negatively impact upon the respective program.
(2) Barely Meets Expectation:  Deliverables are completed on or prior to their respective due date approximately 95% of the time with minor revisions being required on approximately 15% of the items submitted.  The delayed submission and required rework of deliverables results in a minor negative impact to the respective program.  (1) Fails to Meet Expectation:  Deliverables are completed on or prior to their respective due date less than 90% of the time with significant revisions being required on greater than 15% of the items submitted.  The delayed submission and required rework of deliverables results in a significant impact to the respective program.

Questions and responses will be posted as received on a daily basis  starting July 12, 2002.   The Military Health System (MHS) of the Department of Defense is seeking vendors to provide information  related to available information systems support to  conduct Enterprise-Wide beneficiary medical appointing and scheduling, and beneficiary healthcare registration activities in both the ambulatory and inpatient settings  of the direct care system of the MHS.  In addition, the  MHS needs to acquire information systems support  to  conduct workload forecasting in association with  appointing and scheduling activities in its facilities.   The MHS is seeking support for both medical appointing  and scheduling as well as dental appointing and  scheduling across the spectrum of its facilities, both  in the continental United States (CONUS) and overseas locations (OCONUS).

Enterprise Wide Scheduling (EWS) encompasses the  capability to establish patient appointments with the right provider, at the right time, in the right  location, and supported by the appropriate resources of staff and equipment to optimally conduct the appointment  or procedure.  The MHS is seeking to establish this capability in both the ambulatory and inpatient setting.  Additionally, t he MHS intends to conduct scheduling of operating room procedures in both the ambulatory and inpatient setting using the EWS core solution. Enterprise Wide Registration (EWR) encompasses the capability to ascertain beneficiary eligibility and enrollment information (from an off-board system),  establish registration to medical facilities for  encounters, procedures, admissions and services and  conduct general admission, discharge and transfer  processes in the MHS.  Enterprise Workload Forecasting (EWF) encompasses the capability to establish recommended staffing profiles  based on patient acuity/severity index information (by industry standards) and apply these recommended  profiles to the scheduling process to assure that a  suitably skilled mix of staff resources are available at sites in a facility to meet the patient population's acuity based demand for ser vices. The system will be designed to meet DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) specifications, which will support  AES encryption as well as all Federal technological interoperability standards. Section 508 compatible  solutions are required. All vendors that have products that may fulfill part  or all of the above requirements are encouraged to  submit product specifications and descriptions.

The log booms are intended to retain woody debris flushed into Lake Chelan from several fire-affected tributaries, thus preventing this floating material from becoming a public safety hazard.  In addition, large pieces of wood retained by the booms will be designated for use in habitat improvement structures and small wood will be designated for dispersal and/or disposal via chipping.  These booms sites are at remote locations with limited access.

The Government is interested in contractors that could perform one or more of the listed tasks.   A prioritized list of contractors will be established for this ?on-call? work, under a Time and Materials format, using Basic Ordering Agreements.  The Government will place orders for work by contractor availability, according to a prioritized list.  This list of contractors may be maintained for a period of up to 5 years, the estimated life span of the log booms.

(1)	Provide a boat(s) or plane for use in: (a) visual inspections of the condition of the log booms .
(2)	small-scale maintenance work (e.g., minor boom hardware adjustment or replacement)
(3)	Provide a pair of boats (tug or equivalent) capable of moving and manipulating a log boom for relocation to another site or for sweeping woody debris from the Lake in the Rex Fire area
(4)	Provide boats (tug or equivalent), a barge, crane and tools necessary to perform large-scale maintenance work (e.g., anchor placement, log removal, etc.)
(5)	 Provide tug boats (tug or equivalent), a barge and crane capable of loading, transporting and unloading large woody debris from within the log boom to designated stockpile site(s)
(6)	 Provide tug boats (tug or equivalent), a barge and crane capable of loading, transporting and unloading small woody debris from within the log boom to designated disposal sites(s)
(7)	Provide a large capacity chipper capable of chipping large quantities of woody debris delivered to a lakeshore staging area
(8)	Provide tracked or walking excavator(s) capable of installing large woody debris structures in stream banks or along the lakeshore
(9)	Provide boats (tug or equivalent), a barge and crane capable of constructing and installing 
submerged, large woody debris structures along the shoreline in both shallow and deeper water
habitat areas

Offerors will be selected based on the following criteria: (1) guaranteed response time to a work needed call, (2) equipment availability and capability, (3) experience and past performance with similar projects and (4) price.  Interested offerors are requested to provide information addressing these four criteria not later than July 8, 2002.  A Schedule of Items for pricing is available either by e-mail or mail upon request.

Work consists of providing all labor, transportation, equipment, and materials necessary to provide photography services; provide graphic arts services to include interior signs, posters, charts, certificates, publications/repromasters, display art/emblems, and computer generated images on disks; produce and manage a VI web page/clip-art library; manage audio visual equipment for loan to occasional base users at Pope AFB, NC in accordance with the corresponding Statement of Work. A firm-fixed price contract is contemplated, with a base period and four (4) option years. This action is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns.

The successful contractor will be selected using Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures, resulting in the Best Value to the Government.

<DESC>The sources sought synopsis issued on 18 Jun 2002 is cancelled in its entirety and replaced with the following.  The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), 412th Test Wing, Electronic Warfare Directorate, is seeking sources with demonstrated expertise and experience to support Test, Operations and Maintenance (TO&M) for the Air Force Electronic Warfare Evaluation Simulator (AFEWES), a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) Test and Evaluation (T&E) facility located at Air Force Plant No. 4, Fort Worth, Texas.   The Air Force Electronic Warfare Evaluation Simulator (AFEWES) Test, Operations, and Maintenance sources sought synopsis serves as a dialogue between the Government and potential sources and constitutes one form of early industry involvement.  The Government requests industry recommendations, opinions, and feedback.  Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way, or solicit offers from all responsible sources.  The Government will consider all responses to determine the extent of interest of qualified sources in the AFEWES Program.  Industry must submit sufficient information for the Government to determine their capabilities and experience to perform the AFEWES requirements.  The Air Force Flight Test Center anticipates the award of a five-year fixed priced Indefinite Quantity contract that has a three-year base period with one two-year priced option period; however, the Government will consider other contract types.   Anticipated award will be in Q3 FY03 with the performance period to begin 01 Oct 2003.  It is anticipated that the resultant contract will include at a minimum a ninety (90) day phase-in period to afford sufficient time to be able to operate all AFEWES Infrared and Radio Frequency simulators, including, but not limited to, the Jammer Techniques Simulator, Multi-Emitter Generator, AFEWES Clutter Generator, RF and IR high-fidelity threat simulators and other unique, one-of-a-kind AFEWES test equipment.   Since the facility inception in 1958, AFEWES simulations have been developed, operated, maintained, and periodically upgraded at the AF Plant 4 location by Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics Company (or its predecessors) under contract to the United States Air Force.  AFEWES contains high-fidelity, fully-dynamic background (open-loop) and primary player (closed-loop) T&E resources in the Radio Frequency (RF), Millimeter Wave (MMW), and Infrared (IR) spectral regions.  AFEWES simulations represent widely diverse computer and technology levels.  All simulations operate in real-time, at real frequency/wavelength.  The RF/MMW background player simulation is the Multiple Emitter Generator (MEG).  When used autonomously, the MEG provides a dense signal environment for testing passive Electronic Warfare (EW) receivers.  When used in conjunction with the Primary Players, the MEG supports multi-spectral T&E and the evaluation of defensive countermeasures effectiveness in a realistically dense battlefield scenario.  The RF primary player simulations are high-fidelity Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM), simulations that operate between 0.5 and 18.0 GHz.  IR primary player simulations are comprised of multiple red and gray SAM and Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) simulations which include representative hardware, integrated with a flight motion table and target scene projector that operates at correct IR wavelengths.  AFEWES simulations support testing throughout all phases of the electronic warfare acquisition cycle for Department of Defense (DoD), foreign military customers, and contractor EW programs.  Successful TO&M contract performance requires in-depth knowledge, and hands-on staffing to perform daily testing, operating and maintenance functions.  Additionally, technical management of the AFEWES test facility is required.   Firms having an interest, capability and appropriate background are invited to submit particulars of qualification and experience.   Sources must demonstrate the experience and capability to perform preparation, set-up and conduct tests in all areas of the AFEWES laboratory complex.  Sources must demonstrate the knowledge and capability to perform operation and maintenance for the entire AFEWES facility; including unique computer control systems, simulator cable maintenance, flight motion tables, data collection and analysis equipment, secure communications and data transmission hardware and software and internal/external interfaces.  Sources must demonstrate the experience and capability to operate and maintain the existing AFEWES systems without the use of pre-existing operation and maintenance manuals, as they do not currently exist.  Sources demonstrated capability to upgrade existing simulators according to latest information will be evaluated as well as their capability to acquire replacement or spare parts for and repair of simulators and Special Test Equipment (STE).  Critical to this program is the sources knowledge, capability, and demonstrated performance to develop and/or integrate new simulators and STE into the existing AFEWES architecture as this new equipment becomes available from AFEWES upgrade tasks/contracts.  Sources must be capable of integrating Government Furnished Equipment into applicable AFEWES simulators and configuring this equipment for Open Air Range data input, processing, and operations.   Potential sources will be screened for their demonstrated knowledge, experience and capability in the following areas:  operating and maintaining the AFEWES legacy system simulators, as well as conducting multiple, simultaneous tests to include planning, conducting, and reporting functions. Sources possessing the demonstrated experience and capability to perform the requested work are invited to submit a summary of their capabilities and descriptive literature addressing the above technical areas. Responses to this sources sought synopsis should include sufficient information to demonstrate the experience and capability to perform all areas of the required support, as listed above, as part of a qualification package.  The statement of capability should include relevant background and experience, with contract numbers, names and phone numbers of contracting office POC, and names and phone numbers of technical office POC for each contract. Responses to this announcement should be unclassified. Any company proprietary information shall be separately marked. Responses shall be single spaced, single sided and shall be submitted in five copies. There are no page limits to responses. Drawings, diagrams, or figures may be provided as an attachment to the response to clarify stated capabilities.  Because of the nature of EW testing, and the technical characteristics of the simulators, the successful offeror will be required to have as a minimum, a secret clearance, and be qualified to upgrade the clearance to TOP SECRET, immediately upon award.   Sources are advised that the Government intends to use non-Government personnel (Tybrin Corp) to provide technical reviews of statements of capability submitted in response to this synopsis.   Industry is also advised that the solicitation and any resultant contract will be subject to AFMC FAR Sup Clauses 5352.209-9002 Organizational Conflict of Interest (AFMC) (Jul 1997), and 5352.217-9010 Associate Contractor Agreements (AFMC) (Jul 1997).   Sources are advised that any future, actual solicitation issued on the AFEWES Program shall be in accordance with Air Force Material Command FARS Clause 5352.227-9001, (Jul 1997) Qualification of Offeror under Export-Controlled Restricted Solicitation, which states: (This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF RFP ISSUANCE. The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA 209) is seeking information from interested bidders for an airborne navigation system that will enable the strike fighter aircraft such as the F/A-18 E/F to accurately target and deliver guided munitions. This system will be referred to as the Accurate Navigation System (ANAV).  A Request for Proposal is expected to be released in FY 2003. 

ANAV will replace existing navigation systems such as the Carrier Aviation Inertial Navigation System (CAINS II), the Miniature Airborne Global Positioning Receiver (MAGR), and/or Embedded Global Positioning System ? Inertial Navigation System (EGI), depending on the platform.  It will be a navigation unit that combines a high-accuracy INS with a military PPS GPS receiver and act as an upgrade to the medium accuracy systems it is replacing.  ANAV will enable the F/A-18E/F to use sensors such as AESA and ATFLIR to accurately target GPS (Global Positioning System) weapons such as JDAM and JSOW, which require targeting data with Target Location Errors (TLE) within specified limits.

This procurement will be supported by an Organizational to Commercial Depot maintenance philosophy. The initial projected procurement quantity range is 200- 400 units plus the associated equipment and documentation.   Due to the nature of this potential effort, no foreign country sources will be considered. Prospective sources will be required to have a DOD security classification at the SECRET level (both personnel and facility) and the ability to access and store COMSEC material. They will be expected to be knowledgeable of current GPS security issues and HAE requirements and to be in compliance with all aspects of GPS PPS / crypto security documentation. The GPS receiver they select for ANAV must have approval by the National Security Agency (NSA), as well as the GPS JPO.

Interested sources should submit their responses in writing within 30 days of the date of this announcement.  Telephone and other oral means of requesting information will not be permitted.  All correspondence relating to this matter should be directed to Mr. Dave Kelley, Naval Air Systems Command, AIR-2.5.1.8.1.4 KelleyDC@navair.navy.mil.  The Navy will not pay for product research, qualification testing, re-packaging, re-design and/or information received in response to this announcement.  The Navy may use support contractor employees from, DCS Corp., J. F. Taylor Inc., Titan Systems, Inc., Ketron Corp. and Raytheon Technical Services Center (Indianapolis, IN) to assist in reviewing the responses received under this announcement.  Interested sources should provide business size, cage code, phone number, email and point of contact via email and/or telephone.
	
Reasonable questions, not excessive in length, will be answered if submitted to the point of contact at the above email address.

First mixer, Baker & Perkins 100 gram, Model 4 Cu.: Second mixer, Baker & Perkins 500 gram, Model 2 CX Special Horizontal Batch Mixers. Energetic Thermoplastic Elastomers (ETPE) have been developed that can be formulated with nitramines to produce propellants that have many advantages over conventional single and double based gun propellants. The propellants have been mixed with horizontal sigma blade mixers and extruded without  solvents. Nitrocellulose based propellants are also processed using the horizontal sigma blade mixer prior to finishing operations. The horizontal sigma blade mixer is the only explosion proof mixer that can provide homogenous mix and good kneading action on the highly viscous propellant and explosive formulations consisting of energetic ingredients. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of  FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>A -- AMENDED PHASE 2 EFFORT FOR CONTRACT 68-C-01-170:  PERFORMANCE OF A 2.5 m CUT PRE-CLASSIFIER FOR THE VEHICLE EXHAUST PARTICULATE MASS MEASUREMENT MODULE
<DESC>Under authority granted in FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to modify and extend contract 68-C-01-170 with the Particle Technology Laboratory of the University of Minnesota (UMN-PTL) on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS. This modification action involves the integration and characterization of a PM sample probe, pre-classifier, and secondary diluter as a sample path for two prototype diesel exhaust Particulate Mass Measurement Module (PM3) systems.  These PM3 systems are to be integrated into EPA's Simple Portable On-board Test system (SPOT) being developed for the collection of real-world PM exhaust emission data.  This requirement represents a modification to phase 2 of an effort with UMN-PTL for the PM3 system development.  Under phase 1, currently being performed by UMN-PTL, a proof-of-concept sample pre-classifier for a prototype PM3 is being developed and calibrated.  During phase two of the effort the contractor will finalize the design of the pre-classifier, fabricate two units, integrate these pre-classifiers with exhaust PM sample probes and a secondary dilution fixtures form a sample path system for two PM3s, and provide aerosol characterization for  the resulting integrated sample probe/pre-classifier/diluter sample paths.  The aerosol characterization will consist of generating monodisperse liquid particles tagged with a fluorescent dye using a vibrating orifice aerosol generator followed by fluorometric analysis to determine the system 50% cut size, the shape of the penetration efficiency curve and internal particle losses.  UMN-PTL has on-point experience with virtual impactor technology and virtual impactor pre-classifier development giving them the unique ability to provide the design and evaluation of the required pre-classifier for use by EPA in calendar year 2003.

The selected minority health organization offers technical assistance in the areas of administration and program management, busines management, and any other areas of specialized training that community-based and women's service organizations identify to enhance their capacity to deliver HIV services to minority women living with HIV/AIDS.

In response to the g rowning numbers of women in the rural south who are testing prositive for HIV, OWH has developed an additional initiative for HIV/AIDS and women living in the rural south.  This program is titled: Linking HIV/AIDS Primary and Secondary Prevention Education for At Rick Women and Women Living with HIV/AIDS in the Rural South.
