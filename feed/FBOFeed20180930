<p>The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition: <br />FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items <br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items.<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). The offeror's technical proposal shall be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. Offerors who rate unacceptable in Technical will be removed from further consideration for award. Price will be evaluated to determine reasonableness of the proposed price. Unreasonable offers cannot be selected for award.<br /><br />Technical Proposal. Submit a technical proposal that indicates how your company will perform to the Statement of Work, specifically section 3. There are eight individual areas identified in section 3 of the SOW; paragraphs 3.1 - 3.8. Include the following with your quotation for the purposes of technical evaluation; 1) specification sheets for all major hardware, separately identified for each area, 2 a schedule indicating number of days required to complete the project for each area, and 3) the design approach for each area.</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE: Proposal meets the requirements of the solicitation.<br /><br />UNACCEPTABLE: Proposal does not meet the requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>Past Performance: Please include in your proposal three (3) references for recent and relevant projects similar in scope to this project. Recent projects would include similar projects within the past three years. Relevant projects would include the completion of projects that are similar in scope; A/V system design and equipment installation. The Government will evaluate the quality, timeliness, management and safety of the offeror's past performance. The references do not have to be government contracts. Past Performance will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis using the following:</p>
<p>Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown (or "neutral") past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, a neutral rating shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.
