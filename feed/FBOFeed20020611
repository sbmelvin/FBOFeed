<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors, International Broadcasting Bureau (BBG/IBB), Office of Contracts (M/CON), has a requirement for Architect/Engineer Planning and Design services related to Broadcast System design, maintenance, repair, alteration, and facility construction projects at various IBB Transmitting Stations (e.g., Greenville, NC; Delano, CA; Greece, Germany, Kuwait, Botswana, Sao Tome, Morocco, Sri Lanka, Saipan, the Philippines, Thailand, and Belize).  The Government may make multiple awards.  Design projects will be of a general nature involving the design, maintenance, repair, alteration, construction, and installation of various broadcast systems, power generation, satellite facilities, water-sewage treatment, electrical, security, fire protection, fuel storage, HVAC, civil, and building systems in support of broadcasting facilities.  The A/E firm selected shall be required to: (1) perform site surveys and condition assessments, compare alternatives, and recommend design solutions; (2) prepare Statements of Work, drawings and specifications; (3) prepare construction cost estimates and schedules; and (4) provide post-award construction support services.  The BBG/IBB will evaluate each Offeror for this proposed A-E work in accordance with the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.602-1 (Selection of Firms for Architect-Engineer Contracts, Selection Criteria), using the following seven  below evaluation criteria [note: criteria number 1 is significantly more important than the remaining 6 criteria, which are weighted equally]: (1) Professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the required services - i.e., mix and depth of engineering disciplines available in the firm.  At a minimum, firms MUST HAVE immediate access to the following disciplines: Architectural; Civil/Structural; Mechanical/HVAC; Electrical; Fire Protection; Environmental; and Electronic (to include satellite facilities) engineering;  (2) Specialized technical experience and technical competence (including use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design) in the maintenance, repair, alteration, construction, and facilities condition assessment of Broadcast Systems, power generation, water-sewage, security, fire protection, satellite systems, and fuel handling/storage; (3) Capacity to accomplish work in accordance with project schedules;  (4) Degree of successful past performance on Government agency and private sector contracts in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with standards and performance schedules;  (5) Demonstrated capability to accomplish A/E work in various domestic and overseas geographic areas; (6) Proposed method of communication/data transfer with IBB Office of Engineering in Washington, DC.  An indefinite quantity contract is anticipated, with each Task Order being individually negotiated for a firm-fixed price.  None of the above-stated work or locations represent IBB firm requirements, but the selected firm must be able to perform engineering investigation, analysis, design, and construction support services for the above-stated types of projects and locations in order to be considered for this proposed A/E contract.  The estimated amount for all tasks is not expected to exceed $500,000 per year for the base year with a minimum contract amount of $25,000.  Four unilateral Government 1-year options will be included in the base contract with the same estimated maximum and minimum contract dollar amounts per year.  This proposed A/E contract is being solicited, and will be awarded, on an "Unrestricted (full and open) Basis".  Firms desiring to be evaluated for this proposed A-E design and related services work are invited to submit: (1) a Standard Form 254, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire; (2) a Standard Form 255, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project; and (3) any data demonstrating the firm's capabilities in the seven  above-stated A-E evaluation criteria (e.g., reference listing of previous customers, listing of professional recognition/awards, and staff resumes) not later than 2:00 pm EDT, Wednesday, August 28, 2002 to the BBG/IBB Office of Contracts, Switzer Building, Room 2519, 330 AC@ Street, SW, Washington, DC 20547.  Following an initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, BBG/IBB will hold discussions with at least three of the most highly qualified firms to provide the type of services  required.  Selection of firms for such discussions shall be done through an order of technical preference using the seven above-stated evaluation criteria.  Interested firms should note that Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project) are available via the following Webpage address: http://www.gsa.gov/forms/zero.htm.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), operated by the University of California  for the Department of Energy (DOE), is preparing a solicitation for a comprehensive utility planning study (CUPS). By issuing this RFI, we are soliciting sources, information and suggestions for the solicitation, including: proposed contract type; feasibility of the requirement (including performance requirements and data requirements); statement of work; proposal instructions, and evaluation criteria (including the approach for assessing past performance information); the availability of reference documents; and any other industry concerns or questions.

We currently anticipate a two-phase solicitation: In Phase One, we would issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ). Using published evaluation criteria, we would rank responding sources and determine a Short List of the top-rated sources (approximately three). In Phase Two, we would issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the short-listed sources only and, using published evaluation criteria, rank responding offerors, select the source offering the best value to the government, and negotiate a contract with that top-ranked source. The contract would be on a firm, fixed-price basis with four annual, fixed-price options to do an annual update. However, the foregoing is simply our current thinking and our approach may change, based on various factors, including programmatic, schedule, or budget needs, as well as responses to this RFI.

CUPS will evaluate the ability of LANL utility systems to meet our projected utility loads for the next ten years and recommend changes to meet those loads. Future utility loads are to be modeled from the projects listed in the Laboratory?s latest Ten Year Comprehensive Site Plan. The utility systems that are to be evaluated include electrical power, natural gas, steam, water, wastewater, radioactive liquid waste, and storm water systems.

For each utility system?

<DESC>The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has a need for consulting services related to its financial management systems.  The consultant will serve as Financial Management?s functional resource and work in coordination with Information Resources Management on technical changes affecting the legacy business financial system interfacing with the core financial system, ensuring compliance with financial management requirements.  As a government corporation subject to the Credit Reform Act of 1990, OPIC has unique accounting and budget needs.  The Corporation must keep three sets of books to accommodate the accounting requirements of the federal budget, of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB), and of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  OPIC uses version 11i of Oracle Government Financials (OGF), with product extensions to handle federal government accounting and budget requirements, as its core financial system.  OGF links to the legacy business financial systems via an interface program that runs daily.  The legacy system has been moved to an APPX-based platform.  As part of the on-going interface process which ranges from recording entries in the legacy system to generating financial reports from the system of record, OPIC seeks consulting services to perform the following:  1) Assess the impact of the APPX-based platform on the daily interface process, as follows:  Assess ways to eliminate the complexity of transactions processed through the daily interface.
Advise on ways to prevent data entry errors at the source.  Review APPX functionality to suggest enhancements to simplify the daily processing of transactions.  Review the current method of processing daily transactions through the interface scripts to determine if script changes will improve efficiency of the process.  Devise ways to minimize the amount of follow up review required to ensure proper translation of transactions into OGF.  Assess and recommend changes to mapping tables, programs and other aspects of the daily conversion process as required.  Provide documentation for the various process flows, procedural changes and efficient reconciliations.  2)  Ensure that interface processes allow for timely and correct recording and reporting of data for internal and external users, as follows:  Recommend ways to improve the various reconciliation processes needed to ensure efficient, timely, and accurate processing of all financial transactions.   Assess the impact of internal policy and procedural changes on the processing of financial information and subsequent reporting requirements.  Assess the impact of Credit Reform regulations and recommend changes to the processing to ensure proper classification of credit reform transactions and interact with OMB to ensure compliance with reporting requirements.  Evaluate the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on financial management and ensure that the changes are reflected in the recording, processing, and reporting of financial information.  Design and develop parameters for reports for internal and external purposes that efficiently access financial data from both the legacy and the core financial systems.  As a result of the preceding assessments and evaluations, provide written recommendations and examples that can be used to implement those recommendations. The most successful candidate will have extensive technical and functional experience with Oracle Government Financials in a federal government entity (preferably a U.S. Government corporation) subject to GAAP, FASAB, budgetary, and federal credit reform regulations and reporting requirements.
The government contemplates a one (1) man-year effort .  The Period of Performance for the base year will be July 3, 2002 to July 4, 2003 with five one-year options.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), through the Program Support Center, AOS, Division of Acquisition Management, intends to award a 12-month simplified acquisition to The Alliance Project on a sole-source basis.  The mission/goals of SAMHSA/CSAT is to promote awareness of:  1) substance abuse as a national health issue, 2) the effectiveness of substance abuse treatment in America, 3) the need to expand the availability of substance abuse treatment to Americans, and 4) the need to reduce the stigma associated with substance abuse addiction.  One way CSAT accomplishes its mission is by educating its target audience of policymakers; federal, state and local government entities; business leaders; substance abuse and addiction associations and organizations; community-based groups; health providers; clinicians; managed care providers and the general public.  The Alliance Project is unique in its ability to provide CSAT with the outreach and education efforts needed to effectively spread the message that substance abuse treatment is effective and available.  Many of the allied organizations connected with The Alliance Project are current and past partners and sponsors of other CSAT events and programs.  In addition, The Alliance Project has created a database consisting of key leaders of supporting organizations and influential contacts for the dissemination of information regarding substance abuse.  These public-private partnerships are a powerful source of reliable and current information sharing and message dissemination that is critical to CSAT?s success.  The purpose of this simplified acquisition is to continue a collaboration between The Alliance Project and SAMHSA/CAST on projects and initiatives currently in progress such as the Recovery Community Support Program and the National Treatment Plan:  ?Changing the Conversation? and the National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month.  Specifically, The Alliance Project shall:  1) develop and disseminate an information/educational kit of existing materials to assist grass roots organizations in becoming organized and funded community-based organizations; 2) participate in the Recovery Community Support Program annual meeting and provide copies of the minutes to grass roots organizations requesting information and guidance; 3) cultivate and establish a specific outreach with an emphasis on incorporating special populations recovery community organizations in The Alliance Project; 4) develop a constituency database and statistical resources compatible with SAMHSA/CSAT information technology standards, needs and requirements; 5) partner with SAMHSA/CSAT in the National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month celebration; and 6) recognize SAMHSA/CSAT as a partner and funding entity of The Alliance Project.  Under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), the Government intends to solicit only one source for this requirement.  Interested concerns may submit capability statements to demonstrate their ability to provide the required services by June 27, 2002.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotations.

A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received by June 27, 2002, the Contracting Officer will proceed with an award to The Alliance Project.

These roads are located on the Tonasket Ranger District, with the exception of one road segment on the Methow Valley Ranger District.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC SD), intends to award a sole source, cost reimbursement type contract to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, 86 Cobb Drive, Marietta, GA 30063. Requirements include the flight testing of two Government furnished operational C-130 aircraft with  sensors and decision aides cross decked from P-3 aircraft using Fiber Optic Bus Wavelength Division Multiplexing (FOBWDM ?)  Multiple Access Architecture (MAA), using technology developed during a previous SSC-SD program under contract No. N66001-97-C-8605.  The effort will be executed in two phases, with each phase resulting in one completed aircraft, to include design updates, final design preparation, implementation planning, fabrication of FOBWDM? MAA system components, installation, and flight evaluation/testing. Flight evaluations of the modified operational C-130 aircraft shall be conducted over a one-year period, and will require preparation of a final test report for each aircraft incorporating both lessons learned and technical engineering performance data.  The period of performance for the proposed contract is three years from the date of contract award.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330, and the small business size standard is $20M.  Requirements include personnel and facilities cleared at the secret level.  Additionally, personnel are required to possess in-depth knowledge, experience, and understanding of the programmatic and technical decisions leading to the present architecture and current prototypes, as well as the ability to interface with other government agencies involved in the on-going research and development effort.  The Government has determined that this procurement is not available for competition because of the substantial duplication of cost, not recoverable through full and open competition, should it be necessary for another contractor to become familiar with the technologies developed during the previous five-year program.  An in-depth study of the documentation, understanding of the demonstration configurations used on P-3 and C-130 aircraft, and replication of the substantial hands-on experience related to installation and testing would be required.  As a result, it is estimated that an unacceptable delay of approximately two years would result while another contractor developed the specialized knowledge and skills needed to demonstrate an adequate technical and operational capability.  See government-wide numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This procurement is for the continued development of hydroacoustic software codes for the detection of nuclear / seismic explosions. A current challenge of the NEM R&E Program is to formalize accurate event location and identification methods using hydroacoustic data from hydroacoustic installations at various locations around the globe.  The intended technological solution to this challenge is the use of DOE NNSA Knowledge Base location grids of bathymetry incorporating signal reflection and blockages. For this purpose, a hydroacoustic analysis model and software tool has been developed.  This tool needs to be refined and upgraded incorporating newly available data.  Tasks and requirements include: 1) integration of high-resolution bathymetry data from various locations into the model; 2) integration of hydroacoustic observations and predictions for blockage calculations at various locations; 3) software support; and 4) program management and reporting.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541511, Computer Software Programming Services, Custom, and the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 7371. The anticipated contract will be for five years.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Laboratory of Biochemistry intends on entering into a sole source contract with Gatan Inc., 780 Commonwealth Drive, Warrendale, PA 16086 for a Room Temperature Multi-Specimen Screening System. The Laboratory of Biochemistry studies high resolution molecular imaging using FEI Tecnai 12 and Tecnai F30 electron microscope.  Due to the complex technology of the Tecnai microscopy Gatan Inc., is the only source known to the Government that can supply and install the System for integration with the Laboratory of Biochemistry micscrope.  The Multi-Specimen Screening System minimum specifications required: 1)accommodation of 1 to 100 specimens; 2) single axis drive; shall be capable of loading specimen in a small cartridge and locked in the mulitple specimen carrier and mounted on a specially designed workstation which is capable of automatically advancing to the next free position; 3) sample insertion mechanism shall be mounted permanently to the Transmission Electron Microscope and incorporate a bellows seal to preserve vacuum integrity; 4)specimen carrier will be connected to the insertion system and pumped down by a turbo molecular pump; 5)specimen rod shall remain in the microscope at all times; 6) specimen cartridge mass must be designed such that thermal shock is minimized when connecting to the specimen rod to reduce drift; 7)cartridge exchange shall occur automatically without intervention.  The above features extends the FEI Tecnai 12's capabilities for 1)structural determination of membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes at atomic resolution and 2) structural determination of macromolecular assemblies from single particle imaging studies.  Recent advances will allow the ability to examine specimens in a frozen hydrated state.  This will make high resolution specimens-easier to study than with X-ray diffraction and NMR spctroscopy.  Gatan Inc., is the only known source to the Government that can provide a System with the above characteristics.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a stereo microscope that meets the following criteria: -Possess a large viewing area to reduce eye strain -be CCTV/digital camera compatible -possess an integrated lighting system -provide enough focal distance to allow soldering of printed     circuit boards below the lens  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Vision Engineering. This recommendation is pursuant to FAR 6.302-1-ii, for the acquisition of supplies deemed to be available only from Vision Engineering.  A follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof is contemplated.  Competition is impractical because Vision Engineering is the original manufacturer.  Therefore, they are the only vendor capable of providing equipment compatible with existing microscope systems. Full and open competition is not being considered at this time due to the substantial duplication of cost the government would incur and could not recover through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 6/18/02.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Sources believing themselves capable of performing this work must provide a state of capability to the contract specialist by June 27, 2002, 3:00 PM PDT. Description of Requirement: A current challenge of the NEM R&E Program is to formalize accurate event location and identification methods using hydroacoustic data from hydroacoustic installations at various locations around the globe.  The intended technological solution to this challenge is the use of DOE NNSA Knowledge Base location grids of bathymetry incorporating signal reflection and blockages.  For this purpose, a hydroacoustic analysis model and software tool has been developed.  This tool needs to be refined and upgraded incorporating newly available data.  Tasks and requirements include: 1) integration of high-resolution bathymetry data from various locations into the model; 2) integration of hydroacoustic observations and predictions for blockage calculations at various locations; 3) software support; and 4) program management and reporting.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541511, Computer Software Programming Services, Custom, and the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 7371.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Pathology (LP), Specialized Diagnostics Unit plans to procure a Ventana Discovery Automated Staining System and a Ventana Benchmark Automated Staining System from Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., 3865 North Business Center Drive, Tucson, AZ 85705. The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  Minimum Specifications: 1) individually temperature controlled slide holders designed to control denaturation, hybridization and stringency conditions for in-situ hybridization; 2) capable of performing all immunohistochemical procedural steps, including baking of tissue sections on glass slides, heat-induced antigen retrieval and immunostaining; 3) capable of utilizing barcoded dispensers, and should be compatible with automated slide labeling technology that act as recipes to instruct the machine on specific immunohistochemical in-situ hybridization procedures and; 4) shall utilize a technology to prevent evaporation and allow mixing of reagents while the staining/hybridization procedure is in progress, such as or equivalent to liquid coverslip technology.  Although the primary reason for purchasing the above listed equipment from Ventana Medical Systems is to extend the capability of the Unit to perform rapid immunohistochemistry testing and in-situ hybridization studies using the most advanced currently available platforms, there are additional reasons for purchasing from Ventana Medical Systems.  Under a previous contract the NCI has purchased, and currently operates, several automated immunostaining systems from Ventana Medical Systems. In addition, the NCI currently has a contract with Ventana to purchase specific proprietary reagents necessary for operation of both current and proposed automated systems, at pricing linked to volume usage.  The Unit wishes to maintain standardization of equipment and reagents as changing variables at this time would require extensive optimization studies that would be expensive, time consuming, and deleterious to the clinical operations of the unit.  In addition since the reagent contract pricing is linked to volume usage, the government will achieve additional benefits from this contract.   Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. is the only source known to NCI that can meet the above specifications. This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on June 18, 2002.   If you have and questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Faxed copies of capability statements will not be accepted.  All interested parties are to submit one (1) original and two (2) copies to the following address: Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, NIH/NCI/RCB, 6120 Executive Blvd. Suite 6072, Rockville, Maryland 20852-7194.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) seeks offers to continue operation of the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry (the Registry). The Public Health Service Act, Section 379, mandates the Registry to facilitate unrelated bone marrow transplantation by matching patients with volunteer unrelated donors. Successful marrow transplants require a close match of tissue types between patient and donor. The Act requires the Registry, among other things, to: (1) establish and maintain a Board of Directors that meets certain compositional requirements; (2) establish and manage a system for finding marrow donors suitably matched to unrelated patients who need a marrow transplant; (3) conduct public education activities regarding the availability of unrelated donor transplants facilitated by the Registry and the need for additional donors; (4) recruit and conduct tissue typing of potential marrow donors; (5) maintain a nationwide registry of potential volunteer donors and a scientific registry of recipients of unrelated donor transplants; (6) establish standards for tissue typing, donor selection criteria, and procedures for marrow collection and transportation; (7) collect, analyze and publish data pertinent to unrelated donor marrow transplantation and the operation of the Registry, including data concerning patient outcomes at each transplant center; (8) provide advocacy and case management services to patients and donors; and (9) conduct other activities to increase marrow donation and the success of unrelated donor marrow transplants, and to reduce the differences in the chances of finding a matched donor between Caucasians and other population groups.

The Registry currently maintains formal agreements with numerous organizations in the U.S. and other countries, including 136 transplant centers, 91 donor centers, 16 foreign cooperative registries, 9 recruitment groups, 90 apheresis centers, 110 marrow collection centers, 11 cord blood banks, 22 laboratories, and 3 tissue repositories. The Registry contains 4.6 million volunteer potential donors. Each year, the Registry conducts approximately 8,000 searches for donors and facilitates nearly 2,000 transplants, many of them involving foreign donors or patients. The Registry must comply with Section 379 of the Public Health Service Act and other pertinent Federal requirements related to informed consent, confidentiality and privacy, data collection and publication, and computer security. The Registry submits proposed international agreements to HRSA for submission to the Department of State for clearance. Federal funding of the Registry began in 1987 with a grant from the Department of the Navy; Department of Health and Human Services funding began in 1990. The fiscal year 2002 HRSA appropriation for the Registry approximates $20 million. The Government contemplates awarding a cost-reimbursement contract with one base period and four one-year options.

Sources of further information include the Public Health Service Act and the web sites of: the current Registry contractor, the National Marrow Donor Program www.marrow.org, and the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry www.ibmtr.org. The agency will consider proposals from all responsible sources. Send a pre-addressed envelope with your written request to the person above specified to obtain a paper copy of the request for proposals.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Conduct and Independent Analysis and Validation of Information Resources Management Organization Structure, Staffing, and Mission, and Work Assignments and Recommend Any Necessary Changes and Improvements Necessary to Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Rural Development Information Resource Management and Information Technology Support Programs

1.0	General

1.1	Background

Information technology (IT) in both the private and public sectors has undergone a significant transformation within the past several years which has expanded and altered the type of automation support activities now delivered by organizations assigned this responsibility.  The emergence of web-based applications and systems has expanded automation support activities by emphasizing the need for increased telecommunications capabilities and improved security processes to protect information assets.  The deployment of mainframe applications has been superceded with the design, development, and implementation of web-centric applications hosted on servers.  Organizational constructs such as ?web farms? have been introduced.  New automation technologies have been introduced such as firewalls, intrusion detection, public key identification (PKI), electronic data interchange (EDI), data warehouses/data marts, imaging and workflow management, fully automated call centers, automated mail handling, and many others.  New software tools have been introduced which has and continues to alter the landscape of IT organizations as they struggle to keep pace with the accelerating availability of new automation technology.  Organizational structures that, in the past, supported a mainframe environment and a limited array of tools, operating systems, and data base management systems are no longer effective to responding to the automation support demands of today.

In addition to this technical evolution, congressional mandates have emerged that require government agencies to better plan and manage IT capital investments.  IT managers must now be knowledgeable in financial management concepts such as the computation of present values, pay-back period computations, and the computation of return on investment.  Performance goals must be defined and measured continually throughout the life of an investment.  The Department of Agriculture has developed and deployed an Information Technology Investment Planning System (ITIPS) to monitor the performance of agencies in the accomplishment of all capital planning activities.  Annual reporting and review processes are coordinated through the Department with the Office of Management and Budget.  These new capital planning activities have been absorbed by IRM but not efficiently integrated into the organization.

Over the past several years, like most organizations within the federal government, the Information Resources Management organization has been impacted by staffing cuts and decreased budget allocations.  In some divisions and branches reductions in supervisory staff has increased supervisory-to-employee ratios above 25 to 1 while other parts of the IRM organization experience significantly lower ratios. Although this allows IRM to maintain an overall acceptable ratio, realignment of managerial and supervisory ratios is imperative to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of managers in IRM divisions and branches with the extremely high ratios. Secondly, as a result of hiring restrictions and budgetary limitations, the IRM organization has been unable to transform itself to keep pace with the changing technical environment as well as the emerging legislative and Departmental mandates impacting on its mission.  New mission and work assignments have been made to divisions and branches based on the availability of personnel and not necessarily on assigned mission.  This has resulted in much overlapping of work assignments and conflicts in carrying out assigned missions. Thirdly, the reduction in staff has caused many tasks performed within IRM that are directed to monitoring and improving IRM efficiency and effectiveness have been abandoned and the performance of other tasks has been reduced in frequency.   Some examples of such tasks include the constant monitoring and analysis of cost reports related to National Information Technology Center billings, strategic IRM planning efforts,  and the analysis of National Finance Center costs.
 

1.2 Objective

This Statement of Work (SOW) is directed toward the completion of an analysis of the current organizational and staffing make up of Rural Development?s Information Resources Management organization.  This includes the development of recommendations that will allow the Agency to build an IT organization better able to provide the automation support required by the Agency and better positioned to meet the ever changing automation technologies that are rapidly emerging through out the industry.


1.3	Scope

The Agency requires the analysis of current mission responsibilities and workload assignments throughout the IRM organization both in Washington, D.C. and St. Louis, Mo.  The organization structure of the Rural Development IRM should be studied, evaluated, and compared to the structure in other government agencies and in private industry.  Recommendations for organizational and staffing changes should be based on an assessment of ?best practices? throughout the IT community.  Interviews of key IRM managers including the Chief Information Officer, Deputy Chief Information Officer, all division directors, and selected branch chiefs should be conducted.

The Agency requires this analysis and the resulting recommendations in order to effect changes in the IRM organization that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of automation support program throughout the Agency.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) has a requirement for an integrated communication system for the Dragon Eye (DE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) System that provides both downlink of video and telemetry data and uplink of autopilot commands in a Military Frequency Band. The basic requirements to fulfill this effort as described under the Statement of Work are as follows: 

The Contractor shall provide one integrated communication system with cables for the DE UAV System that provides both downlink of video and telemetry data, and uplink of autopilot commands that meets the following communication system requirements:

(a)  Video shall be in the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) format and digital telemetry data and command data up to19,200 baud asynchronous RS-232 data (the minimum rate shall be 9,600 baud).

(b)  Process asynchronous digital data that is bursty in nature.

(c)  The downlink may be idle for several seconds, and the uplink (always on) may be idle for several minutes of receipt of data, or not used to transmit data at all during a mission if no modification to a programmed flight is required.

(d)  The uplink transmitter shall be Radio Frequency (RF) "quiet" (minimized), -40decible (dBm) of radiated power, when no command data is being sent to the aircraft.

(e)  The audio subcarrier in the NTSC downlink shall be used for the telemetry data. An optional second audio subcarrier can exist.

(f)  The integrated communication system shall provide a minimum of four (up to a maximum of 16) switch or jumper selectable non-interfering channels for both uplink and downlink.  Downlink frequencies shall reside in 1710 - 1850 Megahertz (MHz), and uplink frequencies shall reside in 335.4 - 399.9 MHz band.

(g)  The airborne equipment (downlink transmitter and uplink receiver) shall be combined in a single metal enclosure and shall fit in form factor A or B as specified in Attachment A. {Note: See instructions below to link to MARCORSYSCOM web site for viewing attachment}  Power supply voltage shall be 12 volts and the downlink shall provide a minimum of 1 watt of RF output power.  Channel selection switches shall be accessible without opening the enclosure.  Video and antenna leads shall use RG-178 coax.

(h)  The ground equipment - Communication Control Box (CCB) (downlink receiver, uplink transmitter, modem, video overlay, +6Volts Direct Current (VDC) regulator, and goggle control box) shall be small enough to fit into a watertight container (e.g. pelican case model 1120) that has internal dimensions of 7.38 inches by 4.88 inches by 3.12 inches.  The video goggles (Olympus Eye-Trek FMD-250W) and external interface cables shall also fit in case described above.  Power supply - BA5590 (external connections to the metal enclosure) voltage shall be 12 volts and the uplink shall provide a minimum of 1 watt of RF output power.  Switches shall be accessible without opening the enclosure.  The data stripper shall output RS-232 asynchronous data at or above 9,600 baud, and shall be compliant with the Autopilot Comms Interface Control Document (ICD). See Attachment B  {Note: See instructions below to link to MARCORSYSCOM web site for viewing attachment}

(i)  The integrated communication system shall be able to measure Receiver Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) (airborne and ground).

(j)  The integrated communication system shall be compliant with the Autopilot Comms ICD and the Ground Control System (GCS) ICD.

(k)  All ground cables delivered (data, video, and RSSI) shall be shielded, and all airborne cables shall be shielded RG-178 coax (for data, video, and RSSI).  Direct Current (DC) power lines shall be number(#)26 red and black wires, and the transmitter output power lines shall be 2 #26 wires. See Attachment B  {Note: See instructions below to link to MARCORSYSCOM web site for viewing attachment}

(l)  The transmit output power for the airborne and ground module shall have a minimum of 4 power level settings (up to a maximum of 8), between 0W (-40dBm is optimal) to 1Watt (W).

Responses should be mailed to the following address: COMMANDER, Marine Corps Systems Command, Code CTQ1DBM, 2033 Barnett Avenue, Suite 315, Quantico, Virginia, 22134-5010.

<DESC>Research Services for Comparing the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey to the Current Population Survey

Supporting Statement


Introduction
This solicitation is being issued as an Intent to Award to Wayne Vroman of the Urban Institute.  Customer Success Center 2100 M Street, NW. Washington, DC  20037 for research in accordance with FAR Part 13, NTE $55,000.00.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; and a written solicitation will not be issued.      

The Census Bureau conducted the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS) during 2000 and 2001 in nationwide tests of the American Community Survey (ACS) questionnaire.  For both years, the sample size was 700,000 households.  The tests were designed to demonstrate the viability of using data collected over several years as a replacement for the Census long form.  The C2SS included questions about work and search for work so that some rough measure of labor force would be available along with the other social and economic data collected in the survey.  

BLS staff has conducted preliminary reviews of the 2000 C2SS data.  (Data for the 2001 C2SS will be available during the summer of 2002.)  These data differ from the official measures of employment and unemployment for the nation obtained from the Current Population Survey and from the official State labor force data developed from the LAUS program.  The C2SS data report a population and civilian labor force that are lower than the CPS annual average for 2000.  Employment and the employment-to-population ratios from the C2SS are lower than those obtained from the CPS and unemployment levels and rates are higher.  The difference in the population data is counter to expectations, especially because the C2SS uses 2000 Census population controls as enumerated.  However, the universe for the C2SS does not include group quarters, which are included in the CPS.

A number of factors may account for the differences in the estimates.  For example, the C2SS has less detailed questions about employment and unemployment than the CPS.   In addition, the CPS collects data for a fixed reference period, the week that includes the 12th of the month, while the reference period for the C2SS depends on when the respondent fills out the survey.  Other reasons for differences in the estimates include the population controls and universe used by the surveys and different modes of collections ? interviewers for the CPS versus primarily mail response for the C2SS.  


Objectives
The aim of this project is to understand the nature of the differences in labor force estimates between the C2SS and the CPS.


Description of the Project

1.	Review what is currently known and available.  This includes a careful review of existing documentation and interviewing BLS and Census research staff.
2.	Examine the year 2000 tabulations of the C2SS and compare findings with the CPS.  Extend current analysis by making comparisons by age and ethnicity, retaining State detail.  Explore differences attributed to collection mode, reference date, and nonresponse adjustment.
3.	Identify and compare the consistency of patterns observed in the C2SS data for 2001 with 2000.  It is possible that the differences observed in 2000 will be smaller in 2001. 

Description and Scope of Work

The contractor shall develop and test a methodology for comparing the C2SS (both 2000 and 2001 estimates) with those for the CPS.  Further, the contractor will make recommendations on the potential use of the C2SS data in the LAUS methodology, either directly or indirectly. 

The research shall be carried out over a 9-month period, July 1, 2002?March 31, 2003.   Regular contact with BLS staff is planned.  Contact with Bureau of the Census staff may also be required.  A draft report concerning the research shall be submitted by September 30, 2002.  Two presentations at BLS conferences may be performed with travel expenses the responsibility of BLS.   The draft  report in October 22-24, 2002, in San Antonio, Texas.   The final  report will be submitted by January 31, 2003.   Throughout the period, regular communications (at least twice a month) with BLS will take place in the form of e-mail and other exchanges.

Inspection and Acceptance

BLS will make the final inspection and acceptance of all items called for in the project.


Deliverables

The provider shall submit the following items to BLS.  The delivery dates are measured from the commencement of the project, July 1, 2002.  

Item		Description					Delivery Date
1.  	Letter of understanding on work 		2 weeks upon award of PO
				
2.  		Draft project report				September 30, 2002

3.	                  Presentation of findings			October 22-24, 2002

4.			Final project report				March 31, 2003




The report shall include at least:
Descriptions of methodology
Results
Recommendations for implementation
Suggestions for further research

<SUBJECT>A--Interest and participating in controlled laboratory and field demonstrations to baseline the performance of existing Air Warfare Command and Control (C2) Multi-Source Integrator (MSI) systems.
<SOLNBR>MSI
<CONTACT>CDR Kevin Redman, 202-781-0759
<DESC>The Single Integrated Air Picture System Engineer (SIAP SE), in concert with United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) and Joint Air and Missile Defense Organization (JTAMDO), solicits interest for participation in controlled field and laboratory demonstrations to baseline the performance of existing Air Warfare Command and Control (C2) Multi-Source Integrator (MSI) systems.  Using a multi-phase, multi-event approach, these demonstrations will use live-data inputs from military field-environment exercises, as well as recorded inputs during subsequent event phases in a laboratory environment.  A Phase One event was successfully conducted during Joint Combat Identification Evaluation Team (JCIET) 02, requiring passive operation of each participating MSI system (no output to the data links, no local sensor integration).   Phase Two and Phase Three MSI Systems Demonstrations will  be conducted in the laboratory environment.  Specifically, a Phase Two event will be conducted in Sep/Oct 02 and will require passive operation, but the systems will be able to use local sensors if/as applicable.  A Phase Three event has yet to be planned, but this event will place the MSI systems into the data networks as active participants, enabling MSI nodes at each sensor to share data among each other. During all phases, quantitative comparisons of the various MSI systems output file (i.e., composite track-file databases) to the available truth data will be the criteria for determining baseline performance.  Results from each of the three phases of the MSI Demonstration will be used to provide recommendations for operational, technical, and interoperability standards for an objective integration/fusion capability that map to current (and influence future) Joint Requirem ents Oversight Council (JROC)-validated requirements. INDUSTRY DAY BRIEFING AND SITE SURVEY FOR PHASE TWO MSI SYSTEMS DEMONSTRATION.  Interest is hereby solicited for participation in the Phase Two demonstrations to be conducted for approximately two weeks in Sep and/or Oct 02 at the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), Fort Huachuca, AZ.  This event will involve controlled playback of live-data recorded at JCIET 02 as input to each of the participating MSI systems.  Quantitative comparisons of the participants output files to the available truth data will be the criteria for determining system performance.  An Industry Day Briefing and Site Survey highlighting Phase Two objectives and participation requirements will be held 10-11 Jul 02 at JITC, Bldg. 57305, Conference Room 2 from 0800-1600.  On 11 Jul 02, the Government will conduct a group Question and Answer se ssion, as well as individual company breakout conferences where attendees can discuss with the Government their company specific issues related to participation.  A SECRET security clearance will be required for vendor personnel attending this industry event.  See instructions below for submitting the required visit request/security clearance information.   NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO PARTICIPATE.  Vendors interested in participating in the MSI Systems Phase Two Demonstration must submit their notifications of intent and both name and physical/functional description of their MSI systems by Wednesday, 31 Jul 02.  Via written notification, the Government will formally invite prospective candidates to attend a Participant Planning Meeting to be held on Wednesday, 14 Aug 02, at JITC, Fort Huachuca, AZ.  A SECRET security clearance will be required for personnel attending.  Any ven dors/systems not selected for participation in this event will be provided written notice with supporting rationale for their exclusion from this phase of the MSI Demonstrations.    GOAL OF THE MSI DEMONSTRATIONS.   The goal of the multi-phased, multi-event demonstrations is to baseline the performance of existing Air Warfare Command and Control MSI systems.  Results will be used to provide recommendations for standards for an objective capability that map to (and influence future) JROC-validated requirements.    The Government will derive objective, quantitative performance criteria for this experiment from Theater Air and Missile Defense (TAMD) and Combat Identification (CID) Capstone Requirements Documents (CRD).  The data analysis will be performed based on ground truth data, inputs from networks, and data recorded by each MSI system participating in the demonstrations.   The Government will use the criteria to compare ground truth with the composite track-file of each MSI device, to gain a better understanding of individual systems capabilities.  The Government will conduct data analysis and will be responsible for generating quick-look and formal performance reports.  A list of applicable documents that form the basis of the SIAP attributes and the Governments analysis for these demonstrations is available upon request.  The intent of these demonstrations is for data collection purposes and will not result in a contract award. BACKGROUND AND PHASE ONE MSI SYSTEMS DEMONSTRATION INFORMATION.  Multi-Source Integration (MSI) is the process that (1) performs association/correlation and fusion of target track and measurement data received over a variety of tactical and intelligence data networks (e.g., Link 11, Link 16, CEC, TIBS, and Live Ra dar) to create and maintain a composite track-file database, and (2) combines a priori data with dynamic data.  The MSI systems may have organic sensors that contribute to the composite track-file database, and they may also have the capability to both transmit and receive data on the various data links.  Previous studies have demonstrated that fusion/correlation techniques, algorithms, and technologies are mature, but there exists a lack of common quantitative standards for assessing the performance of candidate MSI systems.  The studies recommended development of technical, operational, and interoperability standards for an objective integration/fusion capability. An MSI Systems Phase One event was successfully conducted during JCIET 02 in Apr 02.  The Government provided the following live data feeds to three participating MSI systems: Link 11, Link 16, SADL, CEC, TIBS , TPS-75, ARSR-4, and STARS.  The Government also recorded the available live-data feeds and the truth data (e.g., TSPI) from all JCIET-network participants.  The recorded data is currently being used for post-event, quantitative performance analysis, and selected recordings from this data will be used in the Phase Two event as input feeds for the participating systems.   PHASE TWO MSI SYSTEMS DEMONSTRATION DATA HANDLING AND SECURITY. A Government team will be the primary operators of all Government-furnished equipment (e.g., data input feeds, interfaces, and recorders) and will ensure strict control of data and results to protect against release of classified information, as well as, proprietary interests and intellectual property.  Each participant will be required to provide a copy of (or access to) its systems output file (i.e., track database data-extraction file).  D etails concerning security procedures for the handling, storage, and processing of classified materials will be provided to participants that take part in the event.    CONSIDERATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN PHASE TWO MSI SYSTEMS DEMONSTRATION.   The Governments intent is to provide a forum for the conduct of these demonstrations and a means of data collection and analysis.  Individual participants will not receive funding from the Government to support personnel expenses or the transportation, storage, operation, maintenance, or repair of their system and/or equipment.  Specifically, for the Phase Two event, the Government will provide the following to each invited participant: (1) Opportunity to demonstrate their product and to influence the development of an objective-capability standard for MSI. (2) Copies of the live-data feed recordings used as input sources for Phase T wo (Subject to use and non-disclosure terms and conditions of participation.). (3) Workspace area at JITC. (4) Results of the Governments evaluation of the participants own systems data output file.   (5) Access to the Governments software-based evaluation tool used to evaluate the systems output file, to the extent access is authorized. PHASE TWO MSI SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS. To be considered eligible for participation in the demonstrations, vendors must meet the following requirements: (1) By Wednesday, 31 Jul 02, provide the Government with notification of intent to participate in the Phase Two event and furnish both the name and a physical/functional description of their MSI system (not code level; describe as a black box). (2) Participants MSI system must function at the Command and Control (C2) system level (e.g., link level) and su pport the use of more than one type of input source.  The Government will specify the data feeds and formats to be used in the proposed Phase Two event.   (3) Participants will be responsible for all expenses associated with participation in the demonstration and to honor all terms and conditions of a Memorandum of Agreement, which will specify details of the demonstration including formats for common inputs such as requirements for electrical and physical layer interface, data link layer, network layer (addressing), and transport layer (format), security classification guidance and applicable data handling, use and non-disclosure requirements. (4) During the demonstration, participants must be willing to provide all equipment and personnel required to operate and support their system during the demonstration; provide access to output data (track database data-extraction file ) for recording purposes; and be available to support and participate in data reduction effort (if/as needed).  (5) Participating companies must be able to satisfy SECRET (NOFORN) security clearance requirements. (6) Eligible participants will be required to enter into a Bailment Agreement for use of their equipment. SECURITY CLEARANCE FOR INDUSTRY DAY BRIEFING.  SECRET security clearance is required for the Industry Briefing, Site Survey and sessions with the Governments MSI Team on 10-11 Jul 02.

<CONTACT>Lou Mondello, PCO, 973-724-3104
<DESC>AFuture Combat System: Objective Force Indirect Fire (OFIF) The U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research,  Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey  is conducting a market survey of industry to identify sources that are capable  of supplying prototype engineering and indirect fire concepts that could be  available by 30 September 2003.  The products developed will be parametric  system engineering analyses of a lightweight armament system capable of  providing lethal terminal effects on a wide range of targets at ranges of 2  kilometers minimum to 50 kilometers maximum.  In addition to the system  engineering analyses, concepts and prototype demonstrators will be developed  and evaluated.  Sources responding to this market survey must have established  capabilities and processes to provide System Engineering efforts by generating  draft requirements.  This includes performing parametric analyses at the force  level and below (down to the individual vehicle) to determine Measures of  Effectiveness with which to evaluate the suitability of both the draft  requirements and the system concepts.  The effectiveness modeling should have  the capability to address such factors as mobility, survivability, rate of  fire, resupply capability (of both the system and the Armys logistics train),  reaction time, situational awareness, accuracy, reliability, availability,  deployability (both strategic and tactical) and any other relevant factors  which have a significant impact on the Objective Force-Indirect Fire (OFIF)  concepts ability to optimally and successfully perform its mission. The ability to generate complete OFIF system concepts is also necessary.  The  contractor must have the expertise and capability to evaluate and integrate  such diverse technological areas as automotive; indirect fire armament;  defensive armament; electronics; software; communications; automation;  controls; fire extinguishing; environmental control; nuclear, biological and  chemical survivability; acquisition hit avoidance; penetration avoidance;  diagnostics; prognostics; electronic technical manuals; security and any other  subsystem expertise applicable to accommodating and allocating space, weight,  power, etc. in the OFIF concept.  The contractor must have the capability to  develop concepts in a common development environment (hardware, software and  personnel) which allows concurrent evaluation of the concept layouts with  respect to structural integrity, mobility, vehicle dynamics, component movement  timelines, firing shock, blast overpressure, transportability, thermal  conditions (heating and cooling from external and internal loads), human  engineering/integration, shot lines, munitions, propellants, ignition sources,  internal ballistics, external ballistics, and compartmentation adequacy.    Throughout the effort, the contractor will be required to utilize and present  virtual representations of the concepting and engineering analyses results to  the Integrated Product Team members. One of the significant challenges will be to develop a system that can package  all of the components in a volume and weight that is consistent with transport  on a C-130 aircraft.  As a result, the contractor must provide demonstration of  their ability to generate, mature and fabricate systems that have similar  constraints.  The contractor must also provide details about the processes and  management controls which will be used to achieve these capabilities. The responding contractor's must possess the capability to fabricate,  integrate, test and evaluate prototype demonstrators.  This includes facilities  conducive to assembling breadboard and subsystem prototype hardware,  electronics and software for maturing and proving out Technology Readiness  Levels. The contractor must have the capability and experience to operate within  Department of Defense and US Army statutory and regulatory limitations.   Management functions must be provided which support Cost As an Independent  Variable trade-offs, Risk assessment and management, cost and performance  management and control and information security. The contractor should have a proven record of operating in an Integrated  Product Development environment  coordinating with governmental and non- governmental stakeholders in order to arrive at the best achievable compromise  with respect to performance, schedule, cost and risk. The contractor should show how they would ramp up and execute the prescribed  effort in a 12 month window from approval to proceed  including the personnel,  equipment, subcontracts, processes, manufacturing, test, evaluation, analyses,  and requirements generation and documentation.   Interested vendors are invited to identify their interest and capability to  respond to the requirement by submitting supportive documentation.  Documentation must clearly show evidence and ability to provide support  described herein. This is not a request for proposals. Questions concerning  above to be addressed to Peggy Schomp, SFAE-GCSS-CR-C, email:  pschomp@pica.army.mil or Lou Mondello, mondello@pica.army.mil See Numbered Notes 25 & 26.

<SOLNBR>W81G67-2162-0001

<ARCHDATE>08012002
<CONTACT>Kevin Henricks, 651-290-5415
<DESC>NA The Army Corps of Engineers St. Paul District is planning to replace stop logs at three dams in north-central Minnesota.  The total stop log closure area is approximately 4500 square feet.  Responses to this Request for Information will be used in establis hing requirements for the stop log replacement project. The existing stop logs are timber and approximately fifty years old.  Many cannot be removed in a non-destructive manner without partially dewatering the gate bays.  Revised design criteria require the new closure system to allow a full range of operation under anticipated hydraulic conditions.  The St. Paul District has been unable to identify examples of successful stop log applications for similar hydraulic conditions.  Water control gates have been considered unjustifiably expensive for the infrequent h ydraulic events requiring full capacity operation. Winnibigoshish (Winni) Dam is currently scheduled to be the first to undergo stop log replacement.  While each dam presents unique characteristics, Winni Dam typifies the design issues involved.  Drawings of Winni Dam are enclosed for your review.  Winni i s comprised of five sluice bays and a log sluice bay.  Each of the five 20'H x 14'W sluice bays has a 3.5x5 foot slide gate centrally mounted in a frame with the remainder of each sluice gate bay is filled with stop logs.  The slide gates provide capacity for the majority of water control requirements and the slide gates will be retained.  Passing floating debris and higher flow requirements are accommodated by removing the top ten feet of stop logs in one-foot increments.  Typical conditions require removi ng and replacing only a couple stop logs annually.  Hydraulic events estimated to occur every fifty years require fully opening all bays.  For the five sluice bays, this translates into removing and replacing columns of stop logs in twenty feet of water ac ross a differential hydraulic head of twelve feet. After considering the following general design concerns: Reliability in removing and placing stop logs; Ease of operation and operator safety; Leakage and affects of ice on operation; the Government anticipates procuring commercial product aluminum stop logs customized to satisfy the requirements at each dam.  Your response to the following topics will assist in completing the procurement effort. Identify examples where your product has been successfully applied in high flow applications similar to Winnie Dam.  Include physical characteristics (i.e. dimensions, hydraulic head, lifting force) and a customer point of contact for each. Identify salient design characteristics of your product that ensure it can reliably be placed and pulled in high flow applications similar to Winnie Dam. Does your company have experience submitting proposals for DOD best value procurements?  If so: Did these procurements include installation? Did your company act as the prime contractor  acquiring construction support from a sub-contractor? What recommendations would you make regarding a best value procurement for Winnie Dam? Any additional information that may be beneficial to the Governments procurement team. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. Questions pertaining to this announcement may be directed to the POC, Mr. Kevin Henricks via e-mail at: kevin.p.henricks@mvp02.usace.army.mil.  Responses to this RFI is requested by 2 July 2002, 5:00 PM CDT.

<SUBJECT>B--DUST CULTURABLE FUNGI  ANALYSES ON ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE - Several studies have linked residential mold growth or moisture problems with asthma in children.  The systematic study of asthma in relation to bioaerosols and characteristics of residential environments has not been paralleled by system efforts to understand the effects of identical exposures in the work environment.  It has been shown that office buildings and schools commonly incur moisture problems and moldy conditions.  Despite very strong evidence that fungi are likely a major cause of asthma, data are inadequate to support exposure guidelines.  This is in part due to the sampling inadequacies for fungi and bacteria.  The conventional method for detection and quantification of bioaerosols in the indoor environment is short-term grab sampling for culture of the microorganisms.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  (NIOSH) laboratory facility in Morgantown, WV intends on entering into a sole source procurement with Environmental Microbiology Laboratory, San Bruno, CA to obtain analytical services for chair and floor dust culturable fungi analyses on environmental samples collected within the scope of the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) Work-Related Asthma in Schools and Office Building Project.  Environmental Microbiology Laboratory was the laboratory used in the Environmental Protection Agency's Building Assessment Survey and Evaluation (BASE) study for fungal spore trap analyses.  This procurement will allow standardization of our NORA (Work Related Asthma in School and Office buildings) data with previous research contract data (BASE).  Any change in analytical laboratories would affect the quality and standardization of the data and compromise the research study because there could be potentially significant differences in fungal species identification and quantification between different labs with different protocols and procedures.  Expertise and standardization of methodology is essential, therefore,  Environmental Microbiology Laboratory is the only available source.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIOSH to determine whether the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capabilities statements must be received in the contracting office no later than seven (7) days from the date of this announcement.   Submit information to Brenda Goodwin, MS-1019,  Reference #2002-Q-00469, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   This notice is  issued for informational purposes only.
