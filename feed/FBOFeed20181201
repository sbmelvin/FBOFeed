<DESC>The government intends to solicit local area hotels for a Blanket Purchase Agreement&nbsp;(BPA) that&nbsp;will be renewable annually for a duration of 5 years. It is the intention of the government to award BPA contracts to interested and qualified hotels in Newburgh, Fishkill, and Montgomery NY only. This agreement is used as a tool to outline what we are expecting from the hotel and what the hotel can expect from the government. Room payments will be made using the government purchase card (GPC). Room prices must be at or below the local per diem of the hotel. This is a local area set-aside. Hotel qualifications are identified in the attached Statement of Work. The government estimates calls per hotel can range between 5-40 rooms per month depending of various factors, including but not limited to, room availability from the hotel, mission requirements of the government, cost per rooms, etc. This is just an estimate and does not obligate the government to meet the above mentioned range per hotel/per month. In most cases, the requirement will be for double rooms, double occupancy.
