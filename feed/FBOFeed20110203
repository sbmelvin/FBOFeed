authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  
The anticipated effort requires the development of a trade study to determine 
the feasibility of redesigning the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station 
(CROWS) -05 system to allow full functionality while reducing the overall 
height of the system hardware on the M1A2 Abrams tank.  This CROWS-05 system 
height reduction is necessary to meet the M1A2 Abrams requirement of tank 
commander frontal visibility over the CROWS system in order to assist the tank 
driver to effectively maneuver the tank.  KDAs CROWS are a proprietary design 
and no other contractor could provide these alterations and analysis without 
obtaining KDAs proprietary data.  KDA is the sole contractor possessing the 
ability to provide alternate configurations, variants, and improvements to the 
CROWS systems without introducing significant cost, schedule, technical, and 
safety risk to the program.  These additional risks for  another contractor to 
obtain the design details necessary to perform this task are considered to be 
unacceptable.
Please note that this notice does not constitute a Request For Proposal 
(RFP).  A determination by the U.S. Government not to compete this proposed 
contract action based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the 
discretion of the U.S. Government.  The anticipated award timeframe for this 
action is 2QFY11.

<SUBJECT>An Integrated Approach to Understanding Host-Pathogen Interactions
<SOLNBR>NIAID-DMID-NIHAI2010100
<CONTACT>George W Kennedy, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 451-2607, Fax (301) 480-2248, Email kennedyg@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS<br /><br />Introduction:<br /><br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement to establish multi-disciplinary centers that focus on understanding at a molecular level the host-pathogen interaction using a systems biology approach.<br /><br />Description:<br /><br />The primary goal of the activities carried out under this contract will be to investigate and identify the metabolic, regulatory, signaling, and other biological pathways generated by host-pathogen molecular interactions to help explain and predict clinical manifestations of infectious diseases, host responses, disease progression, and outcomes. Studies will focus on persistent or recurrent infections with well-defined, highly-specific phenotypes. Examples of such infections include, for example, tuberculosis, malaria, leishmaniasis, histoplasmosis, and infections caused by cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes virus, Salmonella spp., Group A streptococci, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Although a systems biology approach could be used to investigate complex biological events, such as cell behavior or microbial communities, the focus of this contract is only on molecular cellular events of the interaction of the pathogen and the host, such as those involved in the biological, biochemical and biophysical processes of microbial organisms or in pathogenesis and disease progression in humans.
<p>Each multi-disciplinary center, composed of teams of investigators with a wide breadth of skills and scientific and technical expertise, will carry out these investigations through one or more Research Projects. The research findings of such projects should have the potential to be applicable or relevant to a variety of pathogenic organisms, which may help to identify common molecular mechanisms that cause persistent and recurrent infections and should lead to a better understanding of the biological, biochemical and biophysical processes of host-pathogen interaction or of the initiation and progression of infectious diseases in humans. Examples of Research Projects include:</p>
<p>&bull; predict, identify and quantify changes in expression of the transcriptome or proteome of both the host and the microbial organism in a human macrophage culture model during various stages of persistent and recurrent infection of the host.<br />&bull; predict, identify and quantify the transcriptional, regulatory and metabolic response of the host's immune response system in various stages of persistent and recurrent infection. <br />&bull; develop models that predict metabolic and regulatory networks that will facilitate the identification of genes that may be coding for virulence determinants and contribute towards the progression of persistent and recurrent infection and disease in different host cells; verify experimentally.<br />&bull; apply transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics profiling to assay the network state of infected host cell cultures; develop a predictive model and validate in infected human tissue for persistent or chronic infections.</p>
<p>Research Projects conducted under this contract should employ a combination of innovative, experimental systems biology approaches, including high-throughput "omics" technologies, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics or lipidomics. Rigorous novel algorithms and analytical methods, including bioinformatics should also be included. It is expected that integrated data sets will be used to build mathematical models of host-pathogen interactions that can be validated by experimental approaches, explaining the molecular basis of clinical manifestations of infectious diseases, including severity and response to treatment and vaccines. Furthermore, results obtained from these studies should identify novel, unique, as well as common molecular signatures that may represent future targets for intervention and could aid in the identification of emerging pathogens and in the development of drugs, immunotherapies, vaccines and diagnostics for prevention and treatment of diseases caused by potential agents of bioterrorism and emerging/reemerging infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Please Note the Following:<br />-&nbsp;This requirement will NOT support studies on HIV/AIDS.<br />- This contract will NOT support studies that focus exclusively on the molecular interaction networks of the microbe with no consideration of those in the host cells, and vice versa. Examples of research areas that are not responsive include:</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with MANTECH Security &amp; Mission Assurance Corporation, 7799 Leesburg Pike, STE 700S, Falls Church, VA 22043-2436 for Program Management Security Support Services for the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JSFPO). The Government intends to procure the above service under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1, to ensure there will not be a break in the services required, while a competitive Seaport-e Task Order is being put in place. The period of performance on this procurement will be six months from date of award, with two (2) three-month option periods.
<p>The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) (F-35) program is a joint DoD ACAT 1D major acquisition program that includes the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps. JSF also includes eight foreign partner countries formally identified as Cooperative Partner Participants (CPP) along with two other countries called Security Cooperative Participants (SCP). Because of the international nature of the program, combined with the highly sensitive technologies being designed into the total air system, consolidated security support to ensure proper technology protection and dissemination is paramount in the execution of the JSF program. MANTECH Security &amp; Mission Assurance Corporation is currently supplying the support services for this requirement. It is in the Government's best interest to issue a new contract to MANTECH for a continuation of services. This will insure there will not be a break in the services required, which would be detrimental to the JSF Program. The impact of failing to award this continued support for the JSF program is both operational and financial. Protection of the critical technologies that distinguish the combat effectiveness of the JSF from legacy programs is essential to the security of the program and essential that the current support be maintained to continue to protect those technologies throughout the entire program life cycle, including deployment and sustainment. Any interruption to these services would cause the entire program to cease operations. Furthermore, there is a financial impact to disrupting the JSFPO Operations because a restart after a stoppage will lead to duplication of costs that will not be recovered.</p>
<p>This contract is being processed solely for the purpose to insure continuity of services to avoid interruption of program support. There is a competitive SEAPORT-e package in process for the contractor support service requirements. This sole source action is a temporary bridge for the continuation of services until the SEAPORT-e Task Order is in place. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice. Any responses should reference N68335-11-R-0096. The Point of Contact is: Ms. Elaine Lovering, email Elaine.lovering@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC>This procurement will result in the award of up to four Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design-Build contracts to successful Hubzone contractors.  The work will primarily consist of Design-Build, Construction Contracts for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) roofing, demolition, repair of facilities and infrastructure including but not limited to: 1) barracks and personnel housing facilities, 2) administrative facilities, 3) warehouses and supply facilities, 4) medical and dental facilities; 5) abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including but not limited to asbestos, lead paint and PCBs); 6) the civil, sanitary, stormwater, mechanical and electrical systems  for the Area of Responsibility(AOR) of PWD Midsouth Contracting Office, NSA Mid-South, Millington, TN.
  This Area is limited to: Naval Support Activity Mid-South, Millington, TN.  

The estimated value for all contracts is $9 million.  Each contract will be for one base year and two option years.  The anticipated range for each task order is between $650,000 and $3,000,000.  This range is for information only and may vary.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.   

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase of up to 6 offerors (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Safety, Technical Qualifications, and Management Approach.
  Phase I design-build factors relate to the three year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including new construction, roofing, demolition, routine renovation and repair of facilities and infrastructure, not just the seed project to be identified in Phase II RFP.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed to Phase II.  

In Phase II, the selected Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals for the seed project.  Offerors who fail to submit their Phase II technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the seed project, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality requirements of construction.
  Price proposals may include total price evaluation or evaluation of scope/design options, within the Governments published budget for award. The best value offeror will receive a contract for the seed project and the best value offerors will receive minimum guarantees. Up to four IDIQ design-build contracts will be awarded for a maximum three years term.  If there is more than one seed project, the offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.
  The Size Standard is $33.5M.
    
After award of the initial contracts, the successful offerors will compete for task orders based on either Best Value to the Government or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.  Proposers will be required to submit a bid bond for the seed project and for each task order.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders.  Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.
  The task order statements of work may be written based on a Government/Contractor Team cooperative scoping of the work. Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may require incorporation of sustainable design features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.
  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one or more of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.

<DESC>The Defense Activity for Nontraditional Education Support (DANTES) has a continuing need for a system whereby representatives of American higher education examine learning experiences occurring within the Military Services to determine the comparability of those experiences with those in the civilian post secondary education community so that where applicable, learning achieved in the military can be applied to a college degree or a vocational credential that can lead to career and educational advancement.  These services are currently being provided under Contract N00189-08-C-Z002 with the American Council on Education.  For the evaluations to be widely accepted, the Contractor must have a wide involvement with American higher education and possess the highest professional reputation to support its recommendations and policies.
  The American Council on Education has demonstrated that it meets those criteria therefore,  FISC Norfolk Contracts Department Philadelphia Division intends to extend Contract N00189-08-C-Z002 with the American Council on Education for a 12-month period extending from 01 Oct 11 through 30 Sep 12.   Numbered Notes #22 and #26 apply.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Sensemaker is a proprietary software developed and owned by Cognitive Edge Solutions (Dr. Dave Snowden). This is a unique, one-of-a-kind software that captures and analyzes narrative data (not numerical data as most surveys do). So that a large number of employees can be surveyed and they would answer narratively.
<p>OBJECTIVES</p>
<p><br />1. Measure attitudes and beliefs of approximately 1700 employees regarding implementation of new strategic plan by using and testing narrative capture and analysis techniques rather than survey research techniques.</p>
<p>2. Use the data to develop and use visual representations of culture and cultural change</p>
<p>3. The narrative capture and analysis study objectives:<br />a. Test the effectiveness and efficiency of using mass narrative capture and analysis techniques <br />b. Compare the types of data collected and analyzed with those typically collected using survey research methods <br />c. Test the concept of disintermediation by making data available to Management without extensive analysis to see what learning occurs.</p>
<p>4. Present a formal written and oral report of findings to Management Team. <br />This will require the vendor to travel.</p>
<p>5. In accordance with the objectives, the contractor shall provide a report of the analysis of narrative data from the use of Sensemaker suite of software (or equivalent) to include an Executive Summary, the analysis itself, an electronic replica of the data set, and a next steps scenario to go beyond the scope of this initial study for agency consideration.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Oregon State Office, plans to negotiate a noncompetitive purchase order with Apparatus Equipment & Services, Inc., 2015 Milestone Drive, Suite D, Salt Lake City, UT 84104-6544 for the repair of a Twin Disk fully automatic power shift model TD-61-1177 transmission.  This transmission is in a fire engine that was made by American Truck Company (ATC) and is called a TATRA.  The following services will be required: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  GENERAL  Repairs needed include:  1) Diagnose and determine repairs needed.  2) Remove 2,500 gallon water tank, plumbing and electrical lines. Then remove and repair transmission as needed.  3) Clean contaminated oil out of cooling system.  4) Re-install transmission, 2,500 gallon water tank, fire truck plumbing, electrical lines by a certified fire apparatus manufacturer mechanic.
SPECIFICATIONS/HISTORY - While working on a fire, the truck operator noticed that he was not  able to drive on reverse at the fire. When the driver returned to his duty station, he contacted the mechanic at the Interagency Equipment Shop to evaluate the problem.  After the mechanic inspected the truck he determined they could work on the transmission, but would not be able to remove the transmission from the truck which would be needed to repair the problem.  It has been determined by the Bureau of Land Management that the transmission will need to be pulled out of the truck by a certified fire apparatus manufacturer.  The tank must be pulled out of the truck without damaging any of the plumbing which would require the axles to be rolled back.  This fire engine is made by American Truck Company (ATC) and is called a TATRA.  The type of transmission is a Twin Disk fully automatic power shift model TD-61-1177.  This transmission is integrated into the chassis backbone tube, eliminating transfer box.  Lockable torque divider front to rear axles incorporated inside the transmission.  Transmission is connected to the torque converter by a heavy duty drive-shaft.  The whole drive train must be pulled when the transmission is removed. The transmission will have to be pulled and inspected to determine repairs needed.  
DELIVERY:  The Government will deliver and pickup the truck to the Contractors site for repairs.
Vendors who possess the capability to perform the named service repairs may submit their qualifications in writing specifically addressing ability to provide the service to the Contracting Officer.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received by 3:30 p.m., February 15, 2011, local time (PST).   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Submittals should include the solicitation number, qualifications, and contact information.  They may be sent by either mail or facsimile.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  All eligible and qualified contractors may submit capability statements for consideration. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the quantity and availability of contractors who have the technical level of expertise, administrative and management capability to perform the effort described below.  The capability statements received will be used to determine The Bureau of Reclamation's overall procurement strategy.
The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement to find out what is causing the deterioration, of the Monument Plaza which is located on the Nevada side of Hoover Dam.  The walking surface of the Monument Plaza is made of concrete-based black terrazzo with brass inserts placed to form a star chart.  Panels of the terrazzo are joined by brass joints.  In the middle of the Plaza is a large black diorite base on which two (2) Winged Figure Statues are placed on each side.  In the middle stands a tall flagpole.  Millions of people walk atop the Monument Plaza each year.  The Plaza sits outside, unprotected in the Nevada weather, which can span from 20 degrees to 130 degrees Fahrenheit.  Over the years the terrazzo has shifted, creating tripping hazards and the diorite is cracking.  
Tests need to be performed to determine the current construction and condition, and obtaining recommendations varying from preservation to restoration.  A testing and evaluation work plan must be developed for the entire site including all terrazzo; brass features, and state ornaments.  Required information for each area is as follows:
Terrazzo The contractor shall conduct a minimum of four (4) underlying tests in various areas of the Plaza.  Tests must not be in close proximity to each other in an effort to understand the full Plaza area as many areas may structurally be different.  These underlying tests shall include removing small panels of terrazzo or core drilling to gain adequate information for this requirement.  Any destructive testing will require NEPA and Section 106 cultural compliance.
The tests shall determine the current condition, makeup, and stability of the terrazzo, make up and stability of the substrate, current construction  and condition of the foundation, and current construction, condition, durability of the expansion joints and their compatibility with the temperatures in the area.
At the conclusion of the tests, the contractor shall determine the cause or causes for deterioration as well as options for levels of stabilization, rehabilitation, and/or restoration that is needed for the terrazzo, substrate, foundation, and expansion joints.  They will also provide preliminary cost estimates for the options.
Brass FeaturesThe contractor shall determine the current condition and stability of the inlayed brass features (zodiac, star chart, and state ornaments).
If the contractor determines that destructive testing is required, they shall submit the proposal to Reclamation for approval.  Any destructive testing will require NEPA and Section 106 cultural compliance.
At the conclusion of the tests, the contractor shall determine the cause for deterioration (if any) as well as the level of stabilization, rehabilitation, and/or restoration that is needed for the brass features.  They will also provide preliminary cost estimates for the options.
"Winged Figures of the Republic"The contractor shall determine the current condition and stability of the "Winged Figures of the Republic" which are cast bronze statues.  This includes the connection to the diorite base, concrete, and foundation.
At the conclusion of the tests, the contractor shall determine the causes for deterioration (if any) as well as the level of stabilization, rehabilitation, and/or restoration that is needed for the "Winged Figures of the Republic".  They will also provide preliminary cost estimates for the options.
FlagpoleThe contractor shall determine the current condition and stability of the flagpole.  This shall include the construction condition since the flagpole is embedded in the diorite base and foundation.
At the conclusion of the tests, the contractor shall determine the causes for deterioration (if any) as well as the level of stabilization, rehabilitation, and/or restoration that is needed for the flagpole.  They will also provide preliminary cost estimates for the options.
Diorite BaseThe contractor shall determine the current condition and stability of the diorite base.  This shall include the current construction to document the thickness of the diorite, adherence to the concrete, and other important information for documentation purposes.
At the conclusion of the tests, the contractor shall determine the causes for deterioration as well as the level of stabilization, rehabilitation, and/or restoration that is needed for the diorite base.  They will also provide preliminary cost estimates for the options.
Culvert and drainage systemThe contractor shall determine the current condition and stability of the culvert and drainage system located directly behind Monument Plaza.  This shall include a study to determine if the system is adequately catching and diverting water.
At the conclusion of the tests, the contractor shall determine if water is seeping through the culvert and drainage system and affecting Monument Plaza, the causes for deterioration (if any), as well as the level of stabilization, rehabilitation, and/or restoration that is needed for the culvert and drainage system.  They will also provide preliminary cost estimates for the options.
A report shall be produced in a historic structures format which lists the current conditions; information discovered during the testing/analysis phases; supporting historical documentation; and recommendations ranging from stabilization, rehabilitation, and restoration.  A minimum of three recommendations will be required and identified as short term (1-2 years), mid-term (3-10 years), and long term (11+ years).  A life-cycle cost analysis of each recommendation will be required.  
Upon final project recommendation by the Government, the contractor will be required to develop a statement of work and final cost estimate that can be used for a future acquisition.  The contractor will also be required to perform research and provide information on any available sources of funding or grants to perform the repair work.
Responsible sources are welcome to submit a capability statement on or before 3:00 P.M. February 28, 2011.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) marshals the department's intelligence and enforcement functions with the twin aims of safeguarding the financial system against illicit use and combating rogue nations, terrorist facilitators, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferators, money launderers, drug kingpins, and other national security threats. Subordinate offices carry out these responsibilities: <br /><br />The Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. <br /><br />The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) has the mission to support the formulation of policy and execution of Treasury authorities by providing expert analysis and intelligence production on financial and other support networks for terrorist groups, proliferators, and other key national security threats and timely, accurate, and focused intelligence support on the full range of economic, political, and security issues. <br /><br />The Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (TFFC), which works across all elements of the national security community - including the law enforcement, regulatory, policy, diplomatic and intelligence communities - and with the private sector and foreign governments to identify and address the threats presented by all forms of illicit finance to the international financial system.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Treasury has an ongoing requirement for support to efforts in analysis, investigation, enforcement and policy development and customer outreach to assist TFI with accomplishing its operational goals.</p>
<p>The eight major areas where TFI is currently seeking expertise are:<br /><br />1. Sanctions Investigation Support, which requires the research, documentation and analysis of complex financial and other activities, relationships, and holdings of terrorist organizations, narcotics trafficking organizations, proliferators of weapons of mass destruction, malign regimes, non-state actors, and their agents; and assisting in identifying vulnerabilities of these groups to sanctions and other actions. This work may include reviewing and analyzing a wide range of financial and business data and developing and writing extensive strategic analysis which will support the designation of specific persons as Specially Designated Nationals and applying U.S. and multi-lateral sanctions to them and the production of administrative records documenting the factual and legal basis for such action.<br /><br />2. Sanctions Enforcement Support, which involves the research, analysis, and documentation of possible violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC to support USG Enforcement actions. Research often involves national or international commercial trade or banking operations. This work may include reviewing and analyzing information, the drafting of memoranda evaluating enforcement responses, making recommendations for the Government's consideration, and coordinating information across other government agencies and offices.<br /><br />3. Transaction Licensing Support, which facilitates the process of reviewing requests for authorization to conduct transactions which are generally prohibited by existing sanctions programs and licensing those which are consistent with U.S. foreign policy. Services may include analyzing requests and making recommendations regarding exceptions to OFAC-administered sanctions programs, especially those related to Iran (including proliferation and terrorism), transnational illicit finance, or narcotics trafficking and drafting for Government review licenses, denials, or interpretive guidance in response to exception requests.<br /><br />4. Sanctions Compliance and Evaluation Support, which assists the investigation of violations of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Acountability and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) and other apparent violations of OFAC administered sanctions programs. The contractor may also assist in recommending new enforcement/evaluation methods or initiatives affecting the financial sector, predicting sanctions-related vulnerabilities within the industry, and reacting to sophisticated sanctions evasion techniques.<br /><br />5. Financial Community Outreach Support, which enables the production of media in a variety of formats for use by Treasury to explain office programs and initiatives. Media will be targeted at government officials and private sector parties within the US and in other countries. Media will require translation to local languages and be sensitive to target audience culture and mores. This may also require support to prepare, organize and conduct electronic outreach events, such as webinars, and the organization, coordination and support of symposia for the public and private sectors for presentations by US Treasury personnel and invited attendees.<br /><br />6. Sanctions Policy Support, which includes providing advisory support regarding the development of economic sanctions policy. Support may include creating written analysis of current and future sanctions efforts and their impact, including areas for change. It may also require the creation of draft briefing and discussion materials on current sanctions programs which will inform efforts by the sponsor to support senior government personnel and to inform external audiences.<br /><br />7. Freedom of Information Act Request Processing, which supports OFAC in its FOIA (5 USC 552) and PA (5 USC 552a) requests processing, document review, agency coordination, draft correspondence preparation and document/information release recommendations. Support may include the review of FOIA/PA requests to obtain associated responsive document located within OFAC divisions, review relevant records, reconcile divergent office/agency responses and prepare documents for release, subject to government authority review.<br /><br />8. Policy Support on Iran Financial Sanctions, which supports the development of financial sanctions policy regarding Iran with policy responsibility for all aspects of Treasury's anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) programs, sanctions efforts, and special projects such as anti-kleptocracy, counter-proliferation financing and counter-insurgency financing initiatives. The contractor will work closely with offices within Treasury, and with relevant U.S. agencies. Support may include assisting in identifying illicit finance trends being deployed by Iran to facilitate proliferation and/or evade sanctions, and proposing policy options to counter this activity. Work may also require analyzing or drafting policy and position papers, and drafting briefing materials to assist in supporting senior Treasury officials, and in supporting international initiatives. Contractor may also review and analyze relevant legislation and policy initiatives, and assist in developing relevant strategies for implementing such laws and policies.<br /><br />The purpose of this sources sought notice is to gain knowledge of the interest, capabilities, and qualifications of prospective offerors in support of the service areas described above. Treasury is particularly interested in understanding the capabilities and qualifications of interested small business concerns. Treasury's choice of solicitation vehicle and acquisition strategy will depend in part upon the responses to this notice of all firms including small businesses.<br /><br />Interested vendors are requested to provide a written response to this notice which is limited to a maximum of 9 pages with a minimum font size of 10 point, one page covering all information necessary to address items 1 - 4 below, and one page per each of the eight categories (items 5 and 6 below).

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) in 2011 for the procurement of analytic projects and is seeking statements of capability from potential offerors. Preference will be given to small businesses with experience and staffing to perform the requirement as demonstrated in the capability statement.
<p>Study Overview</p>
<p>FNS seeks the services of qualified contractors to assist with analytic projects, short studies, research and programming tasks, and other work as needed. The contractor(s) will provide programmatic and technical expertise to FNS to support the agency's evaluation of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the agency's assessment of current and emerging policy issues affecting the program.</p>
<p>FNS expects that several contractors will be awarded the BPA and then the contractors can choose to bid competitively on each task. Each year approximately 3 to 6 tasks will be awarded based on the priorities of the agency. The parameters of the tasks are fixed, with stated objectives and a limited set of well-defined deliverables.</p>
<p>FNS expects that most of the tasks under this BPA will be completed with previously compiled public datasets, although some tasks may require small scale data collections. Work to be performed under this contract may include, but is not limited to, statistical analysis of existing data, econometric modeling, authoring reports, independent review of reports including those produced under other FNS contracts, creation of analytic files from existing primary source datasets, literature searches and reviews, and related research and analysis tasks.</p>
<p>Examples of the tasks that may be awarded each year are as follows:</p>
<p><br />Task 1: Research Review of the Extent and Nature of Under Reporting of Nutrition Assistance Program Participation in National Surveys</p>
<p>This task examines under reporting of SNAP participation in national Census surveys. These surveys contain counts of SNAP participants that tend to be lower than what FNS finds in its own Quality Control (QC) data and in State administrative records. The undercounts differ across surveys, and potentially exist for different reasons. Examples include, but are not limited to the following:<br />&bull;The American Community Survey (ACS) only has one question that addresses Food Stamp/SNAP receipt in its questionnaire. Moreover, this survey is intended to be a rolling replacement for the long-form Decennial Census and is not necessarily designed to extract detailed information about household income and/or participation in government assistance programs.<br />&bull;The March Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC), while more detailed than the ACS regarding household income and employment, still has shortcomings regarding its ability to capture SNAP participation. CPS collects income sources on an annual basis, rather than a monthly basis used in the SNAP eligibility determination and does not collect information on assets and deductible expenses which affect SNAP eligibility. Moreover the CPS also underreports public assistance benefits, like Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) that would be counted as income in SNAP.<br />&bull;The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) tends to have the most detailed survey with regards to household income and program participation. However, SIPP (like CPS) also underreports TANF; has high attrition rates across the length of its survey panels, and has a long time lag (over two years) between data collection, processing and release that may affect its SNAP undercount. <br />&bull;The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has a series of questions that ask about previous and current SNAP receipt, including benefit amount. SNAP participation is underreported.</p>
<p>In addition to the possible reasons for misreporting across the surveys as posited above; households could potentially misreport for reasons related to household characteristics, program participation characteristics (i.e. the length - or shortness- of the participation spell, the size of the monthly benefit), or due to reasons inherent in the design of the survey questionnaire(s).</p>
<p>Overall, this task seeks to assess under reporting of SNAP participation in four national surveys with the goal of identifying potential remedies to the problem.</p>
<p>More specific objectives of this task are to:</p>
<p>&bull;Review and summarize research conducted to examine the extent and nature of under reporting participation in SNAP, other nutrition assistance programs or other major assistance programs targeted to low-income persons.</p>
<p>&bull;Document and compare the magnitude of under reporting that occurs for SNAP participation in the CPS, SIPP, NHANES and ACS.<br />&bull;Identify and compare any variation in SNAP under reporting by household characteristics, SNAP participation patterns, time, question construction or administration, and other potentially relevant factors as observed in the CPS, SIPP, NHANES and ACS.</p>
<p>&bull;Identify possible next steps for addressing the issue of under reporting SNAP participation - e.g. additional analyses to assess problem, question/questionnaire changes, analytic adjustments to currently available participation estimates. i</p>
<p><br />Task 2: Examine the Feasibility of Using GIS Data to Catalog a Representative Sample of Food Deserts and Characteristics of the SNAP Households Residing There<br />SNAP benefits are targeted to the purchase of food for home use and are delivered through normal channels of trade - currently about 200,000 authorized food retailers. Access to a variety of high quality and affordable foods are essential to meeting the Program's mission.<br />There has been an ongoing concern that some SNAP household, especially those living in rural areas or densely populated, low-income communities have limited access to the stores providing nutritious and reasonably priced foods. Such environments are known as food deserts. Most often they are defined in terms of the distance between one's residence and the closest supermarket or large grocer Economic Research Service, 2009).<br />EBT transaction data provide a clear picture of the types of stores SNAP recipients use to redeem their benefits. However, there is little information about the proximity and variety of store types to SNAP households. This project will examine the feasibility of using geographic information system (GIS) tools and extant data sets to identify and catalog a representative sample of urban and rural food deserts, along with the characteristics and shopping patterns of SNAP households living within them.<br />General objectives of Task 2 are to:<br />&bull;Determine available sources of information (addresses, characteristics and food shopping patterns) on SNAP households and stores (addresses and characteristics) to use as inputs in identifying food deserts.<br />&bull;Determine available GIS tools capable of electronically linking relevant data sources. Determine also whether data sources can be linked through other means. <br />&bull;Determine the steps and/or resources are needed to access these data sources.<br />&bull;Identify the key features of these data and GIS tools. Compare these features in terms of format requirements, accuracy, detail, cost, and ease of updating.<br />&bull;Identify any other advantages, constraints or unknowns associated with any identified GIS tools and data sources.</p>
<p>Task 3: Estimating the Racial and Ethnic Characteristics of SNAP Participants</p>
<p>With the introduction of additional response categories for recording race and Hispanic/Latino background, there has been some concern about the Agency's ability to accurately identify these characteristics among SNAP participants. To date, there has been a substantial amount of missing data for these variables in the QC sample. The purpose of Task 3 is to determine if there are strategies to improve the quality of such information.</p>
<p>Among the approaches to consider are:</p>
<p>&bull;Meeting with representatives from the Census Bureau and federal agencies with programs serving low-income populations to share information on the extent to which obtaining racial and ethnic data is problematic and on strategies to address the problem; and/or</p>
<p>&bull;Compare for the same time frame aggregate racial and ethnic data for SNAP participants recorded by States on the FNS-101 form and stored in the Agency's National Data Bank with information in the QC sample. This strategy would also involve obtaining more detailed information on how SNAP eligibility workers assign racial and ethnic codes that are captured in the FNS-101.</p>
<p><br />Task 4: Create a Searchable Database for SNAP Nutrition Education Evaluations</p>
<p>Because SNAP Nutrition Education (SNAP-Ed) takes a variety of forms and is targeted to diverse program subgroups both across and within States, a single comprehensive evaluation is not feasible. In addition, while States are required to conduct needs assessments and use evidence-based educational interventions, they are not required to conduct implementation or impact evaluations.</p>
<p>The evaluations conducted may or may not be communicated beyond the implementing or State SNAP agencies. When shared, they may be found in SNAP-Ed reports to FNS, organizational web-sites or reports, or peer-reviewed journals. Typically the content varies substantially from one report to another.<br /><br />The purpose of Task 4 is to identify the body of SNAP-Ed evaluations completed in the last five years that meet a set of selection criteria established in coordination with FNS. These criteria shall include some indication of design strength for impact assessments as well as indicators of the completeness of information contained in the report.</p>
<p>Key information from each evaluation shall be extracted and used to create a searchable database. The data base shall include links to obtaining the full report, be searchable with variety of keys, user friendly, and easily expanded to incorporate additional evaluations.</p>
<p>Other Information</p>
<p>All responses must be submitted to belal.hammad@fns.usda.gov NO LATER THAN 4:00 p.m. on February 10, 2011. Responses will be considered solely for information purpose only. This is not a request for proposal (RFP) and responses may or may not be used for future RFP. The Government is under no obligation to pursue further action on this request. For questions concerning this notice, please contact Belal Hammad, Contract Specialist, at 703-305-2262.</p>
<p>Please limit the length of the packages to 20 pages. Packages over 20 pages will not be assessed.</p>

<DESC>Subject: Request for Information (RFI) to support the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Security Technology, Checkpoint Efficiency.
<p>1. DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is currently conducting market research to determine if products currently exist to create efficiencies within the checkpoint environment. This RFI does not constitute a future contract and vendors shall not be compensated for providing information. TSA is currently performing a market survey to determine if vendors exist that can meet the following concepts. <br /><br />The two concepts that are being investigated are the following:<br /><br />Automation of Passenger Flow<br /><br />Data identification and correlation<br /><br />Specifically, TSA seeks to obtain (1) information about solutions based on vendor experience in environments similar to TSA, (2) information about products and services offered by industry that provides a turn key solution that meets the above concept(s), and (3) suggestions on alternative approaches to minimize total life cycle cost.</p>
<p>Background: TSA is responsible for "protecting the Nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce." The proposed concept are initiatives being investigated by TSA that incorporates hardware and software in order to move toward a process improvement solution.</p>
<p>There are over 12,000 pieces of airport security equipment installed nationwide including Advanced Imaging Technologies (AIT), AT X-ray, Explosive Trace Detectors and Electronic Metal Detectors (EMD). Passengers currently arrive at a checkpoint and traverse the checkpoint process. This includes divesting items from their person and carry-on items. Their carry-on items and divested items pass through the AT X-ray while the passenger passes through either the AIT or EMD.</p>
<p>The concept that is being investigated includes the following properties: <br /><br />&bull; Provide automated flow of passengers through the process identified above</p>
<p>&bull; Identify and correlate data for systems and processes;</p>
<p>&bull; Be mindful of space constraints within the common checkpoint environment</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BEING RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) PART 10: MARKET RESEARCH.  This RFI is issued solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an Invitation For Bid (IFB), Request for Quote (RFQ), or Request for Proposal or a promise to issue an RFQ/IFB/RFP in the future.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.  In addition, respondents are advised that the United States (U.S) Government is under no obligation to pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  At this time, proprietary information is not being requested, and respondents shall refrain from providing proprietary information in response to this RFI. <BR><BR>SCOPE: <BR>The USACE Nashville District is seeking sources interested and capable for a construction project entitled: Pistol Creek.  The work is located on Greenbelt Lake in Maryville Tennessee (Blount County). Tentatively this will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract. Construction magnitude is between $1,000,000 and 5,000,000.  Performance and payment bonds equaling 100% of the contract award price will be required.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $33,500,000.  Duration of the project is approximately 6 to 12 months.<BR><BR>PURPOSE:<BR>This sources-sought announcement is being issued to identify small business concerns with the capability to accomplish the work. Only those firms responding to this announcement by submitting the following information will assist the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. After review of the responses to this announcement, if the Government still plans to proceed with this acquisition in a competitive nature a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity for the respective project. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. All interested offerors will have the opportunity to respond to solicitation announcement at a later time if a competitive acquisition is pursued. <BR><BR>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <BR>Greenbelt Lake is located in Bicentennial Park, a popular municipal park in the center of the City. This is a 5.4 acre lake that is located adjacent to the public library and serves as a centerpiece for Bicentennial Park.<BR><BR>The existing control structure at the lake consists of a concrete gravity weir. The weir is about 100 feet wide. Elevation drops about 14 feet from the lake impoundment to the Pistol Creek channel below the dam. The dam is equipped with two low-level screw gate outlets to allow drawdown of the lake.<BR><BR>The lake has suffered detrimental impacts due to severe sedimentation and a large population of nuisance wildlife (Canada geese and various duck species). These waterfowl add large quantities of nutrients and bacteria to the lake, negatively impacting the quality of the aquatic environment. The proposed project would excavate sediment from Greenbelt Lake and relocate most of the waterfowl.<BR><BR>This alternative - the lake would be drained and the lake bed excavated using standard earth moving equipment. <BR><BR>Four different configurations of various depths and cross sections for sediment excavation in Greenbelt Lake were assessed to optimize potential benefits versus costs. Variations between the configurations included such factors as different depths, transition zones, and underwater structures.<BR><BR>Sediment Excavation and Removal activities at Greenbelt Lake involve:<BR><BR>Prior to sediment removal activities, the lake will be drained by siphoning the water around the dam. The inflows from Pistol and Brown Creek will be diverted through temporary piping to the spillway south of the dam to prevent an increase in turbidity downstream of the lake. Approximately 2,230 feet of piping will be required to divert the water.<BR><BR>Cofferdams, approximately 7 feet high, equipped with outlet pipes at the base, will be placed at the outfalls of Pistol and Brown Creeks as a detainment area for the inflows prior to discharge through the temporary piping system. The exact height and location of the cofferdams will be determined through site specific measurements. Cofferdams will be placed in such a way as to maximize the lakebed area available for excavation and facilitate connectivity with the shoreline. The cofferdam system will incorporate the use of nylon or polyester reinforced fabric to create watertight seals with the existing shoreline. A flume boot will be installed to create a watertight seal around the discharge pipe. Any necessary reinforcement within the substrate support system will be evaluated and remedied by a certified installation technician.<BR><BR>Conventional mechanical equipment, such as excavators and bulldozers, will be used to remove sediment from Greenbelt Lake. The sediment will be de-watered at designated locations within the project site. The sediment will then be trucked to the local landfill for disposal. Temporary bridges will be utilized throughout the lake as crossing areas for the excavation equipment.<BR><BR>A sediment weir structure will be constructed at the small island near the upstream end of the impoundment. The purpose of the weir is to facilitate sediment deposition in the upstream end of the lake. This will trap and remove sediment during high flows before it can be transported downstream. The weir will consist of large-sized boulders (3ft x 2 ft) to create a natural boulder wall. The top elevation of the weir will be approximately 1 foot above the water surface. To provide additional erosion protection and enhanced fisheries habitat, large<BR>cobblestones will be placed on top of geotextile fabric at the lake bed. The upstream impoundment area will be used as a sediment collection area, which will require periodic maintenance at approximately IS-year intervals. The Sponsor is aware of this requirement.<BR><BR>Greenbelt Lake, Alternative GL - 3. Excavate to 8-foot depth in all areas, with steep slopes. The 8-foot depth would begin at approximately 14 feet from each shoreline and be sustained throughout the center of the lake. The objective of this alternative is to excavate the bottom of the lake to elevation of 862 and create a short, sharp transition from the shoreline to deeper water. An estimated 37,614 cubic yards of sediment would be removed from the lake to achieve the desired elevations. The excavated material would be stacked to drain, and then hauled to the local landfill. The shoreline profile would provide an aquatic vegetation planting area at the O-foot to I-foot planting zone that extends 6-feet beyond the shoreline before dropping off sharply into deeper water. Hard stabilization features such as riprap would be placed within the I-foot to 8-foot depth interval to help stabilize the slope and provide additional fisheries habitat.<BR><BR>Quantities:<BR>  Aquatic vegetation planting area (0-1 ft depth zone) = 16,690 sf<BR>  Riprap or other hard stabilization structures (1-8 ft zone) = 16,690 sf<BR><BR>REQUESTED INFORMATION:<BR>Respondents interested in providing a response to this RFI should carefully read the attached draft specification and submit information which clearly describes the following: (In A through H).<BR><BR>A.  Business name, address, telephone number and point of contact.<BR>B.  DUNS number and CAGE code.<BR>C.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)


The US Army Contracting Command-Picatinny, on behalf of the US Army Office of
Project Manager (OPM) Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) - Technical Management
Division (TMD), is requesting information regarding mature capabilities of
industry/government agencies to provide possible cost-effective 155mm metal
parts processing technologies implemented on cannon launched artillery
projectile casings resulting in controlled fragmentation against both
personnel and materiel target sets. The metal part processing technology must
result in no degradation of IM performance nor reduction in the structural
integrity/safety of the projectile. Capabilities of interest include increased
effectiveness and/or enhanced lethality with controlled fragmentation achieved
by metal part processing implemented on a 155 mm projectile that can withstand
the high cannon launch g-level (>18kG).  This capability must be mature at a
demonstrated Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 or higher and easily/cost-
effectively integrated with established US large caliber indirect fire
munitions infrastructure without loss of throughput or manufacturability. TRL
6 is defined as a system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a
relevant environment.  TRL 6 is described as a representative model or 
prototype system that is tested in a relevant environment. It represents a
major step up in a technologys demonstrated readiness.  Examples include
successfully testing the capability on a 155 mm prototype in a High-G cannon-
launched relevant environment. 


The white paper should include a description of the capability addressing all
the above characteristics, its technical maturity based on TRL with auditable
fact-based test results supporting this assessment, and the point of contact
(POC), telephone number, and email address. Please do not include corporate
capabilities, technologies still requiring development/maturation to achieve
TRL 6, or past performance discussions. White papers must be submitted to
Government POCs no later than 3 March 2011. Selected vendors will be contacted
via email on or about 9 March 2011 to schedule a follow-up meeting. Specific
questions generated from the white paper will be provided and are required to
be addressed as part of the follow up meeting.


This request for information (RFI) if for planning purposes only, and does not
constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a 
commitment by the U.S. Government. No award will be made because of this
request for information. If a formal solicitation is issued at a later date, a
solicitation notice will be published.


Responses should be submitted by 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on Thursday, 3 March
2011. The subject of the mail message shall be:  Request for Information for
155mm Metal Parts Processing Technologies , Your Companys Name. All responses
must be submitted via e-mail to the attention of Renee Prendergast at
renee.prendergast@us.army.mil. Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of  PM Soldier intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Belleville Shoe Manufacturing.  <BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR>1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 13.106-1(b)(1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs:  The boot required is the Belleville Model 340DES from Belleville Shoe Manufacturing, Inc. This is the only boot available that meets the construction, safety and delivery schedule requirements of the US Army for these limited sizes. The Belleville Model 340DES is a flame and conductive heat resistant combat boot for use in hot weather environments by the US Army Aviation community.<BR><BR>3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): The Belleville Model 340DES is the only commercial off the shelf model hot weather boot that is authorized by the US Army Aviation Center and School for use during US Army flight operations. The 340DES was tested in accordance with NFPA standard 1971 Standard on Protective Ensemble for Structural Fire Fighting (2000 edition) and was the only item that met or exceeded the following criteria for US Army flight use: Sole-System Heat Resistance section 6-8, Boot Upper Heat Resistance section 6-7, Flame Resistance sections 5-4.5 and 6-5, and Liquid Fuel splash protection.<BR>  <BR>4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  PM-SCIE has been working with DLA-Troop Support (DLA-TS) to openly solicit this hot weather flame resistant combat boot since 2006. DLA-TS has an open solicitation with a closing date of 10 Feb 2011. However, that solicitation was originally scheduled to close Fall 2010 and has been delayed multiple times due to lack of sources available able to meet the safety criteria. Even with a closing date of 10 Feb 2011, a contract will not be in place until June/July 2011 with sustainment quantities available for funded requisition until 1QFY12. On 17 Jan 2011, DLA-TS held a pre-proposal conference to clarify any questions and verify sources. During that meeting it was verified that only one COTS source (Belleville Shoe Manufacturing) exists currently, however multiple sources should be on line to make this item in the next couple months.<BR>	 <BR>5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: This procurement is for specific low- or zero-balance sizes only. These sizes/quantities are urgently needed to meet immediate fielding schedules for deploying Soldiers. Without these quantities/sizes there will be Soldiers deploying without the required life saving safety gear.<BR><BR>6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:  PM-SCIE submitted an SRP to DLA-TS to centrally stock and sustain this item in 2006. Current solicitation closes 10 Feb 2011 and item should be available for funded requisition in normal supply system 1QFY12.<BR><BR><BR>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: Nathan.c.jordan@us.army.mil no later than 12:00 p.m. on  Monday February 7, 2011.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Nate Jordan, Contract Specialist<BR>Nathan.C.Jordan@us.army.mil<BR>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source follow-on award with BD Bioscience. The CDC Agency utilizes the aforementioned laboratory equipment, manufactured by BD Bioscience, to generate valuable analytical data for HIV prevention reseach studies.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">U.S Customs and Border Protection (CBP) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA).&nbsp; AAMVA develops model programs in motor vehicle administration, law enforcement and highway safety. The association also serves as an information clearinghouse in these areas, and acts as the international spokesman for these interests.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">CBP queries the license plate numbers of all vehicles that cross the border into the United States. To simplify this process for CBP Officers (CBPO) at the primary inspection booths, CBP uses automated License Plate Readers (LPR) to read the license plate number and send the query for each vehicle. Questions have arisen regarding whether "stacked letters" or symbols on license plates are or are not part of the official plate number.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA">CBP's intent to address the issue of whether these stacked letters on license plates are/are not part of a license plate's official number. CBP seeks to determine (1) whether officers should enter or should not enter, and (2) whether LPR software should read or not read stacked letters that appear on some licence plates as being part of the official license plate number. &nbsp;There is a lack of uniformity between jurisdictions on this issue, and on broader issues including non-alpha/numeric characters being used by some jurisdictions, graphics being incorporated into the background of license plates, character fonts and even colors that could affect the accuracy of license plate readers. LPR technology is a relatively new tool for the federal, state and local law enforcement community. This new technology has already proven itself useful in detecting stolen vehicles; identifying vehicles registered to drivers with suspended licenses; identifying vehicles associated with terrorist watch lists; and solving crimes. However, the effectiveness of LPR technology is often hampered by the aforementioned license plate issues.</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">Market research was conducted to identify companies with the proper contacts within both U.S. states and Canadian provinces to access information on licensing and registration of motor vehicles. As none were identified, AAMVA is the only organization that has direct access to motor vehicle and law enforcement agencies at the State/Province levels through its network of established contacts and relationships; hence the basis for this Sole Source determination.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 923110. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">***The Government intends to solicit and negotiate directly with AAMVA. No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities must be submitted in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can perform the requirement. A determination to compete this action based on the responses received is in the sole discretion of the Government. All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities in writing via email. Documents over 10 pages total will not be accepted. No faxed documents will be accepted. Verifications of receipt of responses are the sole responsibility of the contractor. If no responsive statements are received by 18 February 2011, 12:00 NOON EST, an award will be made to AAMVA. The Government anticipates award on or before 21 February, 2011. </span></p>

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has a requirement for the continued engineering, development, test, integration, fielding and on-site operations and sustainment support for the fielded C2BMC capabilities located worldwide. This effort will also include deliverables of hardware and software data and products, training material and systems, test support and operations and maintenance. This requirement is a part of the C2BMC Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) program element (MDA/BC).
<p><br />MDA intends to award a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation as part of a consortium of five major defense contractors (known as the Missile Defense National Team B (MDNTB)) to provide this follow-on effort. The proposed contract action is for system engineering expertise for the next spiral development and continued operations and sustainment of the C2BMC system for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(ii). The MDNTB is the only source that currently possesses the in-depth technical knowledge of the system requirements to satisfactorily perform the work contemplated herein within the needed timeframe. No other source has access to the required technical data and resident expertise to perform the described effort. This expertise cannot be attained by any other contractor within the anticipated period of performance without incurring an unacceptable delay and risk to the overall program in fulfilling these agency requirements and mission and without incurring a substantial duplication of costs. The sole source award will ensure continuity of the program until such time that this requirement can be procured competitively at the completion of this award. The anticipated period of performance is for five (5) years after contract award.</p>
<p>A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No formal solicitation package is available. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Lockheed Martin Corporation directly.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a contract on an other than full and open competitive basis with the incumbent provider Equinix for temporary data center services under FAR Part 12. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a continuing need for uninterrupted data center services, at its Alternate Data Center (ADC), which can be provided, in the near term, only by the incumbent contractor. The current ADC contract is scheduled to expire March 16, 2011. This action is to bridge the ADC site contract to extend services without interruption while the SEC determines revised requirements due to federal data center consolidation initiatives, industry best practices reviews and improvements, and physical infrastructure considerations. The period of performance will be for a 12-month Base Period and one 12-month option period. The incumbent provider is the only source capable of satisfying temporarily the SEC's requirement for uninterrupted data center services. <br /><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and use of this authority is supported by a Justification and Approval. The SEC intends to award a contract to Equinix no later than March 15, 2011. The estimated value of this action is $4,091,000. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSAL. A competitive solicitation will not be issued and no further information will be provided. <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.50 per hour or $140.00 per week or $606.67 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689).<br />The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) _____Are, _____are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) _____Have, _____have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) _____Are, _____are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) _____Have, _____ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />-(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to&emsp;<br />request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is<br />not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br /><br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product List Countries of Origin<br />______________ _______________<br />______________ _______________</p>

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation/Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NIAID-NOI-11059 a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-49 dated January 24, 2011. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414, which has a business size standard of 500 employees. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure a standing order for Britelite Plus on a sole source basis with PerkinElmer Health Sciences. Item/Description/Quantity: 1) Britelite Plus Reporter Gene Assay System, 1000 mL, #6016769, qty-30 cases; (5 cases per month from date of award for 6 months). Britelite Plus is an ultra-sensitive luciferase reporter gene assay system for the quantitation of firefly luciferase expression in mammalian cells. This system is especially suitable for use in 96-, 384-, or 1536-well microplate formats, as in use in the high-throughput environment, because of the short half-life of the reagents. The Britelite Plus is compatible with the luminescence detection technology currently in place with the lab. This technology is used for the detection of other substrates in different applications, so replacing it with another product would be extremely costly and inefficient. Any attempts to change reagents for this particular application at this point would provide results inconsistent with previously gathered data. In addition, the relevance of various projects would be harmed because of the incompatibility of new data with data from previous trial runs; comparison would prove impossible with a change in reagents at this point. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) capability to meet required specifications, 2) price, and 3) delivery. Delivery shall be for 6 months from date of award to Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878. The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor. The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30. FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.232.33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Center Contractor Registration (Oct 2003). In order to be considered for an award, an Offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201 (a).

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated contract award date is on or before February 23, 2011.<br />BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.<br /><br />EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance): Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.<br />Factor 1 - Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements. Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audiovisual equipment and technical support, food and beverage service and menu options, business services, and lodging. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to meet or exceed the requirements of the ADA, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act as it relates to the facility conference space, lodging, and parking. Quotations will be evaluated on the quality of the customer services provided, the layout design and quality of the facilities as reflected by the physical layout and atmosphere of meeting space and the maintenance and upkeep of the facilities including amenities to support the conference such as free wi-fi in the conference space. (b) Availability of Dates. Quoters will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to quotations which demonstrate availability of facilities on the preferred dates in order of preference, i.e. 1st choice date, 2nd choice date, and 3rd choice date. (c) Location. Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility on or near the boardwalk within the zip code 08401 U.S. Postal Code area, with adequate low cost or free parking for participants and presenters. Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities portion of the technical evaluation factors.<br /><br />Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on room design/layout and quality/upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, and the availability of amenities (e.g., high-speed internet, etc) and staff to support the conference. In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.<br />Factor 3 - Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Cost Estimate. Each quoter shall complete the Response Form, Attachment A. which includes the quoter's pricing quotation. Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages; rates for audio-visual and business services; sleeping room rates; and cost options for facility parking rates. The EEOC is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales tax in quotations for which the Federal Government is exempt.<br /><br />Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items and 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, and 52.222-52 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Certification, apply to this acquisition.

The Government may also use any relevant information in its possession or in the public domain.  Ability to provide functions that are not required by the specifications but described as "preferred" may increase an offer's rating for this factor.  

2.	Price.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed price.

3.	Quality/Past Performance.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's reputation for quality and past performance.  By quality and past performance the Government means the offeror's reputation for conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror's reputation for adherence to contract schedules, including both technical and administrative aspects of performance.  The Government will evaluate quality/past performance on the basis of information that may be obtained from the offeror, such as previous commercial and Government contracts.  The Government may also use any relevant information in its possession or in the public domain.

4.	Work plan.  Phasing of the work and schedule for completion are important factors that will be evaluated.  Production down time must be kept to a minimum.  Bidder's ability to keep the laundry up and running to the maximum extent is an important consideration.  Likewise, time is of the essence.  Bidder's ability to furnish and install the new equipment in a timely fashion is an important consideration as well.

(b)	The individual factors are considered to be of equal importance; therefore the non-price factors of technical capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important when compared to price.  

(c)	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

TIME OF DELIVERY

Delivery shall be made within 14 calendar days after award.  The required delivery date will be annotated on each individual delivery order.  Delivery dates specified on delivery orders may be adjusted by the contracting officer to coincide with the date the hospital will be ready to receive installation.  The contracting officer will advise the contractor of the new delivery date at least 45 days prior to the original or adjusted delivery dates.

Truck Delivery:  Truck delivery is accepted 8:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., local time, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays.

Weekend installation is preferred.   Installation site will be available for work to be performed under the contract from 12 Noon Friday to 6:00 a.m. Monday, local time, excluding Federal Holidays.

GUARANTEE

The contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of one year, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government.  The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material which are found to be defective during the guarantee period.  Replacement of material and parts shall be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States.  Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor.

SERVICE

(a) Service during the guarantee period shall be provided within 24 hours of notice from the Chief, Acquisition and Materiel Management Service or his/her designated representative.  A routine service request will be issued upon any failure which degrades system performance but does not prevent continuation of patient care.

(b) Emergency service by a qualified technician must be provided within 24 hours of notification.  Telephone response does not satisfy this requirement.  An emergency service request will be issued upon any failure which prevents systems operation and disrupts continued patient care. 
(c) Prior to and during the guarantee period, service at other than normal working hours (8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., excluding weekends and holidays), if at the request of the hospital, will be charged at an hourly rate which is the difference between current regular rate and overtime rate.  Otherwise, all services shall be performed at no charge to the Government during this period.

AVAILABILITY OF PARTS AND SERVICE

The contractor guarantees availability of servicing and replacement parts for a period of ten (10) years.  

PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO MAKE CONTRACT CHANGES

Please ensure completion prior to submission of your quote. Also note that paragraph (b) of FAR 52.204-8, applies.</p>
<p><br />Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition <br />Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3, HSAR 3006.3, HSAM 3006.3, CGAP 1206.3, and in accordance with (IAW) requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.302-1 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows: <br />1) Agency and Contracting Activity: <br />The US Coast Guard, Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN), proposes to purchase equipment on a basis other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved: <br />Sole Source Procurement of brand specific Personal Computer Radar Processor (PC-RP) from SSR Engineering.</p>
<p>3) Description of Supplies: <br />The proposed acquisition consists of the following: <br />Model 254A Terma Scanter 2001 Dual MASTER Personal Computer based - Radar Processor (PC-RP), 8U Rack Mount.<br /><br />4) Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." <br />Section (ii) "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-<br />(AA) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition..." is directly applicable.<br /><br />5) Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: <br />Congress has directed the US Coast Guard to actively manage Commercial Vessel Traffic in particular Ports and Waterways. Tracking vessel locations is key to this effort. Vessel positions may be automatically acquired using RADAR and/or AIS and manually inputted and updated. The system must be able to accept these inputs. Each vessel's transit must be updated with incoming signals and/or a combination of signals. Signals may come in every second for every vessel in the port. A vessel may be simultaneously tracked via both RADAR and AIS. These signals must be correlated and associated with the vessel's transit.<br />The US Coast Guard tasked C3CEN with providing the equipment and systems necessary to achieve the required Vessel Traffic Management. During system development the SSR System was tested and determined to be the best solution for achieving the mission. The SSR solution was deployed with CGVTS. The SSR solution allows the USCG, via CGVTS, to deploy both Furuno and Terma radars in a port. The SSR solution accepts the data feeds from both radar types and merges them into one radar picture.</p>
<p>6) Description of Efforts Made to Ensure Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Practicable: <br />Requirement shall be posted on to FEDBIZOPS as Brand Specific. The posting will include verbiage that any Offeror that feels that they can provide items that meet this requirement as stated may provide a quotation, and the Government will consider all offers.</p>
<p>7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: <br />During system development the SSR System was tested and determined to be the best solution for achieving the mission. The SSR solution was deployed with CGVTS. The SSR solution allows the CG, via CGVTS, to deploy both Furuno and Terma radars in a port. The SSR solution accepts the data feeds from both radar types and merges them into one radar picture. To select the product from another vendor means we would need to again have to pay the cost of testing. The anticipated purchase cost will be the same that the general public would pay for the same identical item.</p>
<p>8) Description of Market Research:<br />We have performed market research and found other products that perform similar functions to the application requested, however, they would need to be tested and possible modified to meet the interface requirements.<br /><br />9) Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: <br />SRR proprietary equipment SRR Engineering Incorporated is the only Contractor that can manufacture/provide this Install Kit, due to them having Proprietary Data and Production rights.</p>
<p>10) A Listing of the Sources, if Any, That Expressed, in Writing, An Interest in the Acquisition:<br />No other interest has been expressed, at this time. <br /><br />11) A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required: <br />None at this time.</p>
<p>12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. The anticipated cost to the Government is Determined to be Fair and Reasonable.</p>
<p>James A. Lassiter,<br />Contracting Officer, date: Feb/03/2011</p>
<p><br />I certify this procurement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br />LT.Michael Fairbanks, <br />Technical Representative, date: Feb/02/2011</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>Questions e-mailed to the Air Force:</p>
<p>1. Are Canadian nationals allowed to go on site for installation and training?</p>
<p>Answer: Due to the classification of work performed in this facility we have been told, only U.S Citizens are allowed into the area where this equipment will be installed. (Also, Reference questions from the industrial day.)</p>
<p>2. Have they considered keeping any of the mechanical system (X,Y,Z axes, etc) and just doing a motor back upgrade (Everything from the motor back i.e. wiring electronics and software)</p>
<p>Answer: The mechanical portion of this unit is the portion that is being replaced due to the fact it is 23 years old. We performed a software upgrade in 2004 and are now down often due to unsupportability of parts that wear out. We have decided after many Risk Analysis meetings that it is time to replace the unit with new, to carry us on into the future. We don't want a rebuild; we require new. (Also, refernce questions from the industrial day.)</p>

The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication or protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-668, email: Michael.Jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreement, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/ACQ, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. (End of clause), 5352-242-9000, Access To Air Force Installations.</p>
<p>In addition, your quote must list your DUNS, CAGE code, and Federal TIN with Company name, POC and phone number. If you need to obtain or renew a DUNS or CAGE code, please visit www.ccr.gov. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received not later than <br />10 FEB 2011, 11:00 A.M. Local California time. Proposals received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Proposals may be submitted as an attachment to an e-mail addressed to: Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil .</p>

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
<p>Commandant (GG-913)<br />Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement<br />1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402<br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

1.0	Introduction
The VHA Healthcare Retention and Recruitment Office (HRRO) provides funding and oversight for several student training programs and internships. These internships offer college and graduate-level students on-the-job experience in a variety of clinical and administrative career areas. 

In Executive Order 13171 of October 12, 2000, it was noted that Hispanics remain underrepresented in the Federal workforce so the President affirmed ongoing policies and recommendations to eliminate the underrepresentation, to include providing a plan for recruiting Hispanics that creates a fully diverse workforce for the agency in the 21st century.

 It provides outstanding Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities students the opportunity to gain valuable and personally rewarding work experiences with the nation's largest integrated health care system. Moreover, it affords them assignments in locations where they normally would not have the opportunity to go. Through these work experiences, the students may gain credit in fulfilling their academic requirements. In addition, VA is given a valuable opportunity to enhance the student's awareness and perceptions of VA as an employer of choice. These student career work experiences help lay the foundation for future VA employment and increase the likelihood of improving representation among VA's Hispanic population. VA is committed to employ a work force that mirrors the minority we serve.

Please provide e-mail responses in PDF format to the TARDEC/TACOM POC's listed above. The maximum size of each e-mail should be not more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes. You may use multiple e-mail messages. The subject line must include message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3 etc., as well as [Organization Name]. All interested entities *e.g. companies, non-profit organizations, and academic institutes, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. For responses which include "CLASSIFIED" information, contact the Government via email at DAMI_MRAPMarketSurvey@conus.army.mil for additional submission instructions.<BR><BR>GENERAL INFORMATION: <BR>The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as "CONFIDENTIAL" under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <BR><BR>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "CONFIDENTIAL" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <BR><BR>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "CONFIDENTIAL" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <BR><BR>3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data. <BR><BR>4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS" and "CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS" <BR><BR>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <BR><BR>6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "CONFIDENTIAL" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.<BR>

Scope of Effort:  Contractor support is required to provide the necessary services per the Statement of Work (SOW) that will enable the ATC Communications Services Directorate to accomplish its mission objectives.  The SOW is included at Section C of the SIR.  The FAA is planning to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.

This increase is to support additional spares for the RTCASS program, as well as engineering services to support improvements to the processes of migrating Test Program Sets (TPS) from CASS to modern Automatic Test Systems (ATS), and to improve the operation of legacy TPS software on modern ATS. The authority for this sole source action is FAR 6.302-1: only one responsible source. Teradyne is the original equipment manufacturer of the above mentioned commercial products and all technical data necessary for production is proprietary to Teradyne. Therefore, the Government does not have the specifications, drawings or other data necessary to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government. This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses to this notice must be received within 15 days.

<AWARDEE>MINACT, Inc., 5220 Keele Street, Jackson, MS 39206-4302 US
<DESC>A new sole source bridge contract has been awarded to MINACT, Inc. for continued operation of the Phoenix Job Corps Center.  The duration of the bridge will allow sufficient time for the completion of a new competitive procurement and transition to the new operator.  The period of performance is February 1, 2011 to September 30, 2011.  

Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1 allows for other than full and open competition "...when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source."  MINACT, Inc. is uniquely positioned as the current contractor to continue the operation of the Phoenix Job Corps Center.  In addition, transitioning center operators during the short-term bridge contract would be very costly to the Government, extremely disruptive to center operations and staff, and most importantly, negatively impact Job Corps students at the Phoenix Job Corps Center.

<MODNBR>P00196
<DESC>Military Sealift Command has bilaterally executed modification P00196 to contract N00033-82-C-1028 for the operation and maintenance of USNS 2ND LT JOHN P. BOBO. This modification extends the contract period by 185 days, until February 15, 2011 and incorporates an option period of 150 days, extending the contract until July 15, 2011. This extension is necessary due to unforeseen delays arising in the procurement process after GAO protests were filed in response to the award of a contract under a competitive follow-on procurement. In reviewing the record, an error was found in the procurement process which necessitated a corrective action. This corrective action entails the reopening of discussions with offerors in the competitive range and the evaluation of new final proposal revisions to arrive at a new source selection decision. The current contract period of performance was previously scheduled to end on August 14, 2010. A lapse in service would have occurred without the modification to extend, and an insufficient amount of time remained prior to contract expiration for a competitive procurement of services to bridge the performance gap.
