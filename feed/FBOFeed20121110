When deficiencies are reported to the Contractor, the Contractor shall take immediate steps to correct them. If the Contractor does not take immediate steps to correct deficiencies, the COR shall report the facts of the event to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to take any appropriate action authorized by law to resolve the issue or to terminate the contract for default.

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN FOR CUSTODIAL SERVICES INTRODUCTION 
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to evaluate Contractor actions while implementing this contract. It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring Contractor performance for each listed objective in the contract. 
The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the Contractor is required to furnish. 
This QASP is based on the premise the government desires to maintain a quality standard in operating this contract to provide the optimum service. 
The Contractor, and not the government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved. 
In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality. The Contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of inspections and monitoring actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the Contractor to success. 
Once the quality control program is approved, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust quality assurance program. 
Basic Services. 
The parking lot and walkways will be kept clear of precipitation and maintained safely for patient and employee use.  Performance threshold:  
SURVEILLANCE: The COR will receive complaints from clinic personnel and pass them to the CO for correction. 
STANDARD: The standard is three or less customer complaints per month in each area. The COR shall notify the contracting officer for appropriate action in accordance with FAR 52.212.4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items or the appropriate Inspection of Services clause, if any of the above service areas exceed three customer complaints. 
PROCEDURES: for any of the above performance objectives should immediately contact the COR and the COR will complete appropriate documentation to record the complaint. The COR will consider the customer complaint valid upon receipt from the customer. The COR should inform the customer of the approximate time the unacceptable performance will be corrected and advise the customer to contact the COR if not corrected. The Contractor will be given two hours after verbal notification to correct the unacceptable performance. If the Contractor disagrees with the complaint after investigation of the site and challenges the validity of the complaint, the Contractor will notify the COR. The COR will determine the validity of the complaint. If the COR determines the complaint as invalid, he will document the written complaint of the findings and notify the customer. The COR will retain documentation for his/her files. If after investigation the COR determines the complaint as valid, the COR will inform the Contractor, and the Contractor will be given an additional hour to correct the defect. A defect will not be recorded if proper and timely correction of the unacceptable condition(s) is accomplished. 
Ordered services meet the requirements of the contract as appropriate.     Performance Threshold:    100% of the time. 
SURVEILLANCE: The COR will evaluate the services required by each delivery order to ensure compliance. 
PROCEDURES: The government COR will inspect all work tasks required by the task or delivery order to ensure Contractor compliance with the appropriate paragraphs 1.1, 1.2, and/or 1.3 of the Statement of Work (SOW) each time the service(s) is performed. Record results of inspection, noting the date and time of inspection.  If inspection indicates unacceptable performance, notify the contract manager or CONTRACTOR of the deficiencies for correction. The Contractor shall be given two hours after notification to correct the unacceptable performance.
