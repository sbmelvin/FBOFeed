California Blvd., Pasadena California, CA   91125 for follow-on contract (D ASW01-02-C-0027) entitled PROGRAM EVALUATION OF THE SECURE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION AND VOTING EXPERIMENT (SERVE). The Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP), Washington Headquarters Service (WHS), administers the federal law guaranteeing the right to vot e by absentee Uniformed Services personnel, the Merchant Marine, and citizens residing outside the U.S. (The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). FVAP works closely with state and local election officials to identify ways to improv e the absentee registration and voting process for these citizens. Based on post-election surveys and other data, the biggest barriers to the enfranchisement of these citizens are mail transit time and the mobility of the UOCAVA population.  FVAP has been directed by Congress to conduct an electronic voting demonstration project with participation of sufficient numbers of absent uniformed services voters so that the results are statistically relevant. FVAP requires assistance in refining and executing the S ERVE evaluation methodology and defining the demonstration project in a manner that will yield statistically significant results.   The period of performance of this contract will be from date of award until September 2005. No RFP will be available for com petitive proposals.  This announcement is for informational purposes only.  See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>R--ENIGNEERING SERVICES TO SUPPPORT VALVE REGULATED LEAD ACID (VRLA) BATTERY DEVELOPMENT FOR SUBMARINE MAIN STORAGE BATTERIES
<SOLNBR>N0016403R6920
<RESPDATE>032703
<ARCHDATE>04262003
<CONTACT>ROGER BRETT 812-854-5269
<DESC>The Government has a requirement for engineering services to support the US Navy's goal of converting main storage submarine batteries to commercial Valve-Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) technology.  This procurement is for Phase III of that process, and the Navy intends to solicit and negotiate this contract on a sole-source basis to Exide Corporation, d/b/a GNB Industrial Power, a Division of Exide Technologies, Aurora, IL based on FAR 6.302-1, only one source capable of meeting the Government’s requirements.  See numbered note 22.  Exide has already been awarded the first two phases.  The instant effort will consist of four tasks as follows: (1) Design, fabricate, and test a VRLA B-type cell based on Exide's ABSOLYTE XL product for the submarine platform selected by the Navy.  Most of the design has been accomplished in Phase II.  After fabrication of some cells, the testing of the  cells will involve electrical performance characterization, battery life testing, validation of charging schemes planned to be used, determination of heat and gas generations, shock testing, and other required testing to establish the safety of the VRLA technology in the operating environment of a submarine; (2) Design, fabricate, and test a VRLA C-type cell.  Required efforts will be similar to task (1) though not quite as extensive.  A first article build of the C-type cells will be completed  (3) Provide ship alt preparation support.  The contractor will provide support to the design shipyards related to ship alterations that may be required for the change from the current lead acid battery designs to the VRLA. (4) Prototype facility monitoring.  To demonstrate the viability of the VRLA battery to operate and function in the electrical environment of a submarine, the Navy i nstalled two commercial VRLA battery systems at the reactor training facilities in Ballston Spa, NY.  Under this task the contractor will provide engineering support in the examination and analysis of the performance of these two batteries.  The contractor will examine all operational data prior to test discharges will be required to be on-site to conduct pre-test inspection, take impedance measurements of cells and participate in the discharge and recharge testing conducted on both battery systems.  A fixed-price contract will be awarded, with tasks three and four anticipated to be established as level-of-effort contract line items.  The anticipated period of performance will be 1 April 2003 through 30 September 2003.  This procurement will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 12 procedures, acquisition of commercial items.  Our command no longer issues solicitation or ame ndments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed via our web site.  Inquiries may be submitted to Mr. Roger Brett, Code 1164ER, telephone 812-854-5269, fax 812-854-5666, e-mail brett_r@crane.navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations having in-house capability to perform support services for the management, oversight and logistics of the NIDA International Visiting Scientist and Technical Exchange Program (INVEST).   INVEST is designed to advance the global body of drug abuse and related health consequences.  Specifically, the goals of this program are to: (1) facilitate the development of an international network of drug abuse scientists who are knowledgeable about NIDA?s research and who contribute to global knowledge about drug abuse; and (2) promote opportunities to build international collaboration in prioritized areas of research on drug abuse and related health consequences. As the world's leader in drug abuse research, NIDA's technical consultation, capacity building and research information are in far greater demand than can be provided by in-house staff exclusively.  The contract will provide support to meet this unique and increasing demand and will promote collaborative research with international scientists on the global problem of drug abuse.  Specifically, this contract will require the contractor to: (1) provide a significant level of professional experience with international research program development and expansion; (2) provide administration and support services relating to the competitive award of international drug abuse fellowships to postdoctoral investigators; (3) provide support for the promotion of collaborative research with scientists from other countries as well as consultation in technical information areas related to drug abuse; (4) provide logistical and technical services at an international level; (5) prepare, implement and evaluate multinational research symposia.

RFP No. N01DA-3-1113 will be available electronically on or about March 12, 2003.  You can access the RFP through the Fedbizopps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov or though the NIDA?s website at the following address: (URL: http://www.nida.nih.gov /RFP/REPList.html).  

NIDA anticipates that a 3-year cost reimbursement type contract with 2 twelve-month option periods will result from this procurement.   Please note that the RFP for this acquisition will be streamlined to include only the work statement, Deliverables and Reporting Requirements, Special Requirements and Mandatory qualifications, Technical Criteria, and other necessary Proposal Preparation Instructions.  All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in or accessible through the electronic RFP package.  Responses to the RFP will be due on or about April 28, 2003.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institute of Health (NIH), will make available a request for proposal (RFP) to interested offerors with the ability to serve as a Tissue Processing and Distribution Center (TC) for a new five-year multi-center research program, the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC). The overall objective of the LTRC is to enable better management of lung diseases by increasing understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of these diseases through molecular histopathological studies of human lung tissues with and without disease.  The LTRC will facilitate histopathological research of pulmonary diseases by collecting lung tissues from donors and preparing and distributing collections of tissue specimens to researchers within and outside the Consortium. Primary emphases will be on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Collections of specimens will be linked to extensive, individual clinical data appropriate to the particular disease.  Donor subjects will be recruited for specific enrollment groups that are designed to address important research questions.  The consortium will be comprised of a TC; Clinical Centers (CC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-04-08; a Radiology Center (RC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-04-10; and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC), RFP-NHLBI-HR-04-11.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to read the RFPs for all of these components of the LTRC to better understand the overall structure and function of the Consortium.  The TC shall prepare protocols for specimen procurement, processing, transport, storage, and distribution; train CC personnel regarding specimen handling, processing, and shipping to the TC; conduct site visits to assure that LTRC protocol procedures are followed; perform diagnostic histopathological analysis of lung tissues; obtain relevant quantitative measures of disease presence or severity (e.g., mean chord length) in lung tissue specimens; perform quality control/quality assurance tests and report results to the DCC; store specimens received; perform diagnostic, light-microscopic, histopathological analyses of CC lung tissues by a board-certified pathologist; and prepare and distribute specimens and collections of specimens to researchers. The Principal Investigator of the TC shall participate fully in the activities of the Steering Committee to:  identify lung conditions other than COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for which lung tissues are needed for research and may be available from External Tissue Contributors (ETCs); define inclusion/exclusion criteria for auxiliary groups of donor subjects appropriate for research of these conditions; set target numbers of donor subjects for each group, determine what tissues are to be accepted (e.g., surgical specimens, transbronchial biopsies), and determine what data should be extracted from the donor subjects? medical records in each of these groups; identify any problems with existing LTRC procedures and any difficulties that may interfere with LTRC objectives; devise strategies to improve procedures and overcome difficulties, and submit recommended changes in policies and protocols to the Scientific Advisory Committee for evaluation.   The TC shall maintain an inventory of specimens and specimen collections available for distribution to investigators; transport specimens and specimen collections to LTRC investigators and external researchers as directed by the DCC and in accordance with the LTRC Protocol Manual; work with other LTRC investigators to prepare reports and manuscripts for publication.  ******This is not a RFP and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this notice.  It is anticipated that  RFP-NHLBI-HR-04-09, Lung Tissue Research Consortium: Tissue Processing and Distribution Center (TC), will be available on or fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice through the NHLBI Website at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and posted on FedBizOpps at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<CONTACT>ELEANOR R. NOLAN, Contract Specialist, Phone: 202-564-3446, E-Mail: nolan.eleanor@epa.gov
<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK MBE/WBE Fair Share Rulemaking Technical Assistance BACKGROUND 	The purpose of this requirement is to provide the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) with technical support during its Minority Business Enterprise (MBE)/Women Business Enterprise (WBE) Rulemaking process.  	 In an effort to further assist the Regions and EPA grant recipients in complying with and understanding new standards resulting from the Supreme Court ruling in  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 115 S. Ct. 2097 (1995), OSDBU has a need for experienced professional technical assistance in the areas of outreach; facilitating public hearings; responding to public comments; and evaluating and analyzing availability analyses and disparity studies. 	 The newly established mandate in the Adarand decision is new to the Federal government procurement process.  Over the next 48 months, OSDBU will be completing its Rule making process to change the Agency's MBE/WBE program to meet the changes now required given the Adarand decision and the Department of Justice's review of the program.  The Agency will also consider changes that will make the program more user friendly and uniform across the Regions, between the states, tribes and territories. 	The contractor shall perform work on a work assignment basis. TASK 1	The Contractor shall provide technical assistance to EPA by reviewing the proposed rule and providing comments for EPA's consideration.  To accomplish this task, the contractor must be knowledgeable of Adarand v Pena, procedures for conducting availability analyses and disparity studies, DOT and other federal agencies similar programs, and how DOJ might react to the proposed rule.   TASK 2 	The contractor shall identify the affected business community in the 10 regions.  Specifically, the contractor shall identify the numbers of MBEs and WBEs providing supplies, services, equipment, and construction in the 10 regions, indian tribes, trust territories, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, likely to contract or subcontract on EPA-funded projects. The contractor shall accumulate the data obtained in a database.  In addition, the contractor shall identify constraints the firms are having related to small disadvantaged business certification, amount of work received from prime and subcontracts, and other issues of concern.  TASK 3	The contractor shall perform National Outreach to the affected business communities in up to ten EPA regions to educate them about the rulemaking process and to get their input.  The contractor shall provide background information on the history of the socio-economic procurement program leading up to Adarand, explain why the Agency must be in compliance with Adarand, and explain EPA's rulemaking process and schedule.  Firms identified through the previous task will be targeted directly through mail and telephone contacts and indirectly through advertisements.  The Contractor shall coordinate and facilitating meetings with the communities to gather input for the Rulemaking.   The contractor shall prepare a presentation which summarizes the proposed  EPA rule, solicit comments, prepare charts, graphs, and audio/visuals explaining the proposed rule, and provide , logistical support for public hearings, to include arranging for court reporters and transcripts, and providing transcripts to interested parties.  TASK 4	The contractor shall meet with  with Federal, State, Tribal and Trust Territories to get their input on the Rule Making process. The contractor shall prepare a presentation explaining the rulemaking process from each audience's perspective(s).  In addition, the contractor shall facilitate discussion, solicit comments, and record the comments.  To the extent possible, these meetings will be held concurrently with the meetings in Task 3.  However, there may be a need for two or more additional meetings to make sure Indian tribes and trust territories, such as Puerto Rico, are included in the process.  TASK 5	Once the rule is "proposed",  the contractor shall facilitate a series of public hearings.  The contractor shall assist EPA by conducting outreach to the affected business community to maximize attendance at the hearings.  The contractor shall also prepare handouts summarizing the proposed rule.  We expect no more than 10  public hearings which could take place at any location within the continental United States, territories, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  During the hearings, the contractor shall facilitate discussion, solicit comments on the proposed rule, and record the comments. TASK 6	The contractor shall provide technical assistance on all comments referred by the project officer relating to fair share negotiations and the EPA MBE/WBE program.  As is required in Task 1, the Contractor must be knowledgeable of DOT and other Federal Agency's similar programs should we get questions on why the programs are different.  In addition, the contractor shall provide technical assistance on how goals should be established in line with the census bureau's county business patterns database, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code and North American Industrial Classification (NAIC) Code classifications, and on any other issues that OSDBU does not have the technical expertise to answer.  It is expected that OSDBU  will receive hundreds of comments, which will require a response,  during the 90- day comment period.   In addition, comments must be sorted, classified, characterized, and summarized.  The general categories of comments may include the following: TASK 7	The contractor shall assist in developing a "How To Guide"/Cookbook on the MBE/WBE program once the Rule becomes final.  The assistance will involve updating the OSDBU MBE/WBE Guidance Document, Guidance for Utilization of Small, Minority and Women's Business Enterprises in Procurement Under Assistance Agreements - 6010, 1997 Edition on changes to the MBE/WBE Program resulting from the final rule.  The guidance document currently has approximately 100 pages of text and charts.  TASK 8	The contractor shall provide formal training to EPA, State, Tribal, and socio-economic firms on MBE/WBE program guidance and requirements, procedures for conducting and availability analyses and disparity studies.  It is anticipated that the contractor shall provide no more than 10 four-hour sessions per year. DELIVERABLES/PRODUCTS 1.

The report shall include tables, graphs, diagrams, or charts, as appropriate, summarizing the results of the contractor's accomplishments.  Each report shall be  in sufficient detail to document the work accomplished.

SCHEDULES Schedules will be furnished to the contractor as specified in the individual work assignments. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS Contractor personnel will need access to files located at EPA.  Access is not such that it will require allocation of office space; it is intermittent during the period of the work assignment for which it is required.  During these episodes, steps will be taken by EPA to clearly identify contractor personnel as such while on site at EPA.

<DESC>The Colville National Forest is seeking professional architectural and engineering services to design complete a Ranger District Office.  Interested firms shall submit Standard Forms 254 and 255 to the address listed herein by the closing date indicated in this announcement. Design includes alternative concepts, architectural, electrical, mechanical, landscaping, and civil engineering skills.  Final product includes plans, specifications, and cost estimate.  The general concept includes a wood frame one or two story office building at the Republic Ranger Station, Republic, Washington.  The building must fit comfortably with the community design theme, (Western Victorian) but still present the Forest Service?s image as a quality natural resource agency.  The office size need is approximately 6,000 gross square feet, including space for 20 permanent and 5 temporary Forest Service employees.  The design shall be flexible to allow for shifting programs and approximately 25% future expansion. Also included in design shall be considerations for site preparation, connection to city water and sewer service, telecommunication service from the local serving utility, as well as conduit system and telecom wiring to other on-site buildings, connection to existing power, underground sprinkler system, access road and parking, information kiosk, and landscaping, as well as guidelines or plans for demolition of the old office, re-landscaping the old site and moving the existing modular building. Although designer will do basic concept (foot print) design, Government will design final for roads, parking and signs. The Republic Ranger District Office site is on the Colville National Forest, in Ferry County in Northeastern Washington.  It lies within the Republic city limits and is accessed from city roads linked to State Route 20, a designated Scenic By-Way and on a leg of the Golden Tiger bicycle route and the International Scenic Loop. The facility will service as the administrative office for the Republic Ranger District.  The design project will be used as a case study to ensure that Forest Service structures shall, to the extent practicable, incorporate the principals of sustainability, reflect their place within the natural and cultural landscape, and provide optimal service to our customers and cooperators.  This includes things like using building scale and massing appropriate to the site, using natural and local materials where appropriate, employing colors that complement local vegetation, soils, and rocks, and designing with energy efficiency and sustainability in mind.  Some important considerations common to all FS buildings are (1) Assure that site planning provides for easy visitor travel information, convenient parking, accessibility, safe and attractive pedestrian circulation, minimal site disturbance, native landscaping, vegetative shading where solar gain or glare is a problem, and clear identification as a Forest Service site. (2) Go Green ? design for sustainability and energy conservation, especially where value analysis shows relatively short payback.  Utilize day-lighting, natural ventilation, low maintenance/natural/local materials, efficient HVAC systems, appropriate insulation, motion-sensor or programmable lighting and HVAC controls, water conserving fixtures, changeable interior layouts, and recycling.  The consultant will also provide submittal review and consultation to the government during construction.  Firms will be evaluated on the following factors: (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services (25 points); evaluation will be based on experience and qualifications of proposed key personnel including specialized technical skills, project coordination, management skills, and experience working together as a team. (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of design work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction and the use of recovered materials. (25 points); evaluation will be based on direct experience related to the preparation of preliminary and final specifications, drawings, and operation and maintenance plans for administrative facilities design. (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required performance time (15 points); evaluation will be based on ability to accomplish multiple work tasks, completion within performance time, ability to add personnel and/or consultants to complete work on time. (4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules (25 points); evaluation will be based on quality assurance plans or policy of the firm, success of designs, latent defects related to designs, and overall timeliness of performance under previous contracts. (5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project. (10 points); evaluation will be based on location of the firm, knowledge of the cultural, social, economic, and geographical area and the resources of Northeastern Washington, centered around the Republic area. Interested and qualified firms should submit a completed SF-254 and SF-255 to this office no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 21, 2003. All submittals, including SF-254 and SF-255 documents, shall be originals. NO Fax copies will be accepted. Only firms responding by this date will be considered for selection. This is a TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The Small Business Size is based on NAICS code 541310, which is $4 million average annual income.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Blanket Purchase Agreement(BPA) for  highly specialized engineering support for the International Space Station CMG. The ISS has 4 CMGs that provide non-propulsive attitude control for ISS.  Four healthy CMGs are required to fly ISS stage 12A and to assure microgravity capability for the life of ISS.  Determination of any failure is absolutely critical to mitigate measures that can extend the life of the remaining units on orbit.  This support will be in the form of attending meetings to discuss and recommend measures of maintaining the CMG life cycle, and providing reports that stress methods of mitigating potiential problems.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/JSC intends to award this BPA to Alan R. Leveille, 8896 Fort Crestwood Dr, Las Vegas, NV 89129. The authority for this sole source is FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii). Mr. Leveille has superior expertise in the field of CMGs. He has specific knowledge of the ISS CMG configuration from previous work in preperation of Root Cause Analysis. Mr. Leveille has provided analysis and independent assessments to bearing applications that involve mechanisms designed for long-term space based applications for NASA and DOD. It is believed that no other person available has the depth and breath of knowledge that Mr. Leveille has in CMGs for the International Space Station. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested parties may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 3/10/2003.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with University of East Anglia, Norwich NR47TJ, U.K., to participate in the task of developing a PM chemistry model that will be used by EPA and the States to evaluate control strategies for reducing ambient PM2.5 concentrations in support of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC.  EPA is interested in the development of such a model that will enable the agency to determine the contributions of specific sources to  ambient PM2.5 levels.  Recently, Dr. Simon Clegg of the University of East Anglia, an internationally recognized expert in PM chemistry modeling, with support from Dr Edward Edney of the National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) RTP, has developed the first version of a new PM chemistry model,  the Aerosol Inorganic and Organic Model (AIOM), for predicting ambient compositions of PM2.5 containing organic compounds, inorganic salts and acids, and liquid water.  The general barriers within the scientific community have been that (1) the individual physical and, in particular, chemical  processes, especially those involving organic-water, organic-organic, and  inorganic-organic interactions have not yet been sufficiently established to develop such a model and (2) even if somehow it was possible to develop the model, the required thermodynamic input data are largely unavailable,  especially liquid vapor pressures and activity coefficients of polar organic compounds that make up a significant portion of the PM2.5 mass.  The reasons that EPA believes that the University of East Anglia is the only source capable of providing the specific services is due to the fact that during  the past year, Dr. Clegg (of the University) and Dr. Edney (of EPA) have been able to overcome these road blocks by (1) expanding the Aerosol Inorganic Model (AIM), developed by Dr Clegg over the past 8 years and has been regarded as the most rigorous inorganic model in the world, to include  organic compounds using a novel approach reported in the journal article authored by Clegg et al.,2001, Thermodynamic Modeling of Aqueous Aerosols containing Electrolytes and Dissolved Organic Compounds, Journal of Aerosol Science, 32, 713-738 and by (2) modifying the computational chemistry-based  Conductor-like Screening Model (COSMO) so that it can be used to predict liquid vapor pressures and activity coefficients of organic compounds in PM2.5. Also, Dr. Clegg is the only known contractor having experience using the AIOM to predict concentrations of organic and inorganic compounds in  PM2.5.  Objective: It is anticipated that OAQPS along with the States will use a version of AIOM in state implementation plans to assess control strategies for reducing ambient PM2.5 concentrations.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends, on a sole source basis, to convert an existing Blanket Purchase Agreement with IBM Global Services to an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract with Cost Plus, Time and Materials, and Fixed Price type task orders.  IBM will continue to serve as the successor contractor.  IBM possesses the requisite expertise and knowledge regarding the full integration of the Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) system and its functionality.  

The purpose of this contract is to provide continued information technology (IT) services and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software (and other non-developed and developed software items) necessary to reengineer CMS's accounting processes and to replace and modernize the non-standard, legacy Medicare financial management systems, including those of the Medicare contractors.  The HIGLAS system will be one integrated accounting system which will support all Medicare contractors and CMS central office administration, establish standard financial processes and data classifications, promote consistent, standard processes for CMS and Medicare contractors, and produce automated, standardized financial statements and reports. As a result, HIGLAS is an extremely complex, highly specialized system requiring a highly sophisticated systems integration (SI) effort based on state-of-the art SI accounting and technical knowledge, and the ability to understand and work with the extensive and complex Federal and Medicare accounting rules, the Medicare business processes, and the operations and requirements of numerous Medicare contractors, which currently use non-standard and fragmented accounting methods. 
 The timeframe for implementation and operation of the HIGLAS system is aggressive, given the critical need for the system. The two pilot contractor test sites are scheduled for implementation by September 2004. IBM possesses the requisite expertise and knowledge regarding the integration of the complete HIGLAS system and its functionality. The period of performance will be for a one year base period with nine (9) one year option periods. 

Original Point of Contact: Kimberly Tatum, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-1009. FAX 410-786-9643.email:ktatum@cms.hhs.gov

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Scope of Work

This requirement is designed to meet the Government?s Paperwork Reduction Act (GIPA) through management and development of strategic processing including increase in quantity and range/type of electronic submissions while maintaining a high level of security during the review process and post-marketing product life.  The contractor will be required to provide services and support resources capable for evaluating, processing and managing paper and electronic drug documents (applications and submissions).  The contractor must be able to provide support in a dynamic and changing environment, ideas to improve the receipt and handling process, offering innovative approaches that result in time and cost efficiencies.  A major objective of CDER is to reduce paper usage thus relieving document storage space, document distribution cost, distribution time to reviewers and document maintenance necessary in managing drug application as well as giving expanded flexibility to the FDA review and possible outside reviews.    CDER is involved in a major effort to enhance CDER drug reviewers? productivity and quality of work by requiring submissions to be received electronically.  It is anticipated that this will result in a decreasing dependency on paper processing activity during application review.  The contractor will also need to be able to manage documents in a timely and secure manner during day-to-day planned activities and facility relocation.
The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items and services necessary to perform the daily activities in the operation and management of four of CDER?s document rooms.

The contractor shall develop and explain a quality control team approach based on government provided schema.
The contractor should be capable of developing and demonstrating an electronic (text and image) compatible system for receiving, maintaining, distributing, and archiving DMF material.

As a future project, the contractor must be capable in the development and execution of an internal Library service that enables the distribution and management of electronic application material from the DDR?s to the Review community.  This Library service would function as a repository for the Review community.

5.  Building Marine Corps Multi-Switch Networks (BMCMSN)
This course teaches Marines how to build campus networks using multilayer switching technologies over high speed Ethernet. This course addresses the integration of routing and switching technologies to create an efficient Marine Corps network.
The one sentence goal for this course is best stated:
The purpose of this course is to design, build and configure a Marine Corps network so that if any physical link, switch or router fails an end user won't know; i.e. 24x7 user access to the network.
To meet this goal the Marines will be taught not only to design physical redundancy into their network, but about the Layer 2 and 3 protocols that are necessary to guarantee users constant access to the Marine Corps network.
Spanning Tree is a layer 2 protocol that permits redundant layer 2 physical paths. Spanning Tree is covered in depth in this course. Marines will review the default spanning tree rules, then be shown why they usually do not want to accept many of the default spanning tree parameters. They will be shown how to "tweak" the default spanning tree parameters so that their data is taking the correct physical path and that in the event this path fails, a backup path is quickly made available. They will learn about protocols such as Uplinkfast and Backbonefast that need to be configured to speed convergence times in the event a physical path fails. They will learn why DHCP will fail unless "portfast" is enabled. They will also learn how to get more bandwidth between network devices by configuring etherchannel.
At the higher layers the Marines will learn the advantages of Layer 3 and 4 switching and the steps necessary to configure this process. They will also learn how to configure routers to run HSRP so that if a router fails another router will take over routing user traffic.
Among the skills the Marines will learn are: To create VLANs. To propogate VLAN information with VTP. To manage Redundant Links with Spanning Tree.To enable InterVLAN Routing.To improve IP Routing Performance With Multilayer Switching.To implement HSRP for Fault Tolerant Routing.To manage High Bandwidth Broadcasts With IP Multicasts.

THIS 5 SESSION TRAINING MUST BE COMPLETED IN THE ORDER ABOVE AND BE PROVIDED DURING THE MARCH ? JULY 2003 TIME FRAME.  BIDS SUBMITTED SHOULD BE BROKEN DOWN BY COST PER COURSE.  10-20 STUDENTS ARE ANTICIPATED TO ATTEND EACH COURSE.

ALL ELSE REMAINS THE SAME.


The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a sole source Purchase Order to Hibbitt, Karlson & Sorenson, Inc. for the renewal of the ABAQUS software license.  The ABAQUS software performs computer modeling of tests and is an essential part of the curved girder bridge and high performance steel research projects.  Because this software is vital in performing laboratory tests and Hibbitt, Karlson & Sorenson, Inc. are the manufacturers of the software, they are the only known source for the renewal of the software license.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about March 26, 2003.

<DESC>MODIFICATION/AMENDMENT FOUR (4) to FA2550-03-R-0005 SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  Global Positioning System Support Center. 

1.  The Government is considering restricting this acquisition to GSA schedule holders. In order to reinforce our market research, please advise our office if your company can perform these services using an established GSA schedule.  The required services cannot be split between two or more GSA contracts.  

2.  We have attached the most recent draft Statement of Work, dated 19 Feb 03.  Minor changes and refinements are still being made; however, the required services are fairly well defined in this revision.  We have also attached a draft Operating Instruction that further defines the required services.  Upon final approval, the Operating Instruction will be incorporated into the Statement of Work so that guidance should be taken into consideration when responding to this sources sought.

3. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 2002 code for this requirement REMAINS 541330, Engineering Services, exception: Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, with a size standard of $23M.  HOWEVER, IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT?S INTENT TO RESTRICT THIS EFFORT TO SMALL BUSINESSES.  THIS WILL BE FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.

4.  PLEASE NOTE: A NEW RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED.  Because our requirements are now better defined, all interested GSA contractors must respond to this amendment even if you have responded to the earlier notice.  PLEASE SUBMIT CAPABILITY RESPONSES BY 26 FEBRUARY 2003, 2:00PM MST.

5.  PLEASE NOTE: OUR MAILING ADDRESS HAS CHANGED.  Large OR small contractors who believe they possess the expertise and experience under a GSA Contract vehicle shall submit technical capabilities CITING YOUR APPLICABLE GSA CONTRACT INFORMATION in writing to Ms. Karla Weaver or Ms. Janet Stinson, 50 CONS/LGCZW, 210 Falcon Parkway, Suite 2116 Schriever AFB, CO 80912-2116, or electronically to karla.weaver@schriever.af.mil or janet.stinson@schriever.af.mil.

<SOLNBR>JRRF-0001
<RESPDATE>022803

<CONTACT>Michael Delaney, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-366-2810, Fax 202-366-3237, Email michael.delaney@marad.dot.gov
<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THOSE PARTIES INTERESTED IN SUBMITTING PROPOSALS IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. 

The following information is provided in response to questions MARAD has received regarding the JRRF vessel defueling and tank cleaning effort:


1. Question:  Are all the ships in the JRRF available to be cleaned/defueled?	      Five ships at the JRRF are presently scheduled to be dismantled without prior defueling or tank cleaning.  These ships are Mirfak, Catawba Victory, Mormac Dawn, Santa Isabel, and Santa Elena. While Contractors may still choose to submit proposals for the defueling/tank cleaning of these vessels, it is unlikely that the Government will award a contract for their defueling or cleaning outside of a total ship disposal solution.
2. Question:  Will the Government supply barges to move the used fuel?  Contractors must supply their own waste transport system.  Government transport or barges are not available. Contractors? vessels are limited to five foot (5?) draft for using the approach channel to the JRRF boat basin.
3.  Question:  What help or facilities can or will the Government provide, and what will the cost be for their use?  							      The Government can supply electricity (440 V, 200 amps, 3 phase), transportation to the vessels, crane service, and porta-potties.  MARAD can furnish an 18-ton land crane; 15 and 10 ton floating cranes; forklifts to 15,000 lbs.; and a pier side berth for up to a sixty-foot (+/-) craft. However, there will be a charge for the use of Government cranes, personnel, tugs, and the Government will perform its own price adjustment to the contractor?s proposal to include these charges.  For electricity, a disconnect box can be made available.  Any support provided by the fleet would be based on the standard fleet hourly rate for a normal workday (0700-1440).  Any time after normal working hours would be charged at an overtime rate of 1.5 times the standard rate. The type and extent of Government support required must be identified in the offeror?s proposal.
4. Question:  Can we work on the ships outside of normal working hours?  Contractors could be allowed to continue work on the ships outside of the JRRF normal working hours.  Each request would be considered individually. Launch services are available M-F 0715 to 1440.   Any launch services provided after these normal working hours are overtime.  Overtime rate is the standard fleet hourly rate times 1.5.  Launch services outside these days and times may be available, but this should be identified in the Offeror?s proposal.
5. Question:  Can we move a ship to clean and defuel it?  			 	The vessels can be moved to an outside berth for work to proceed, however any shifting of vessels will be performed by Government personnel and tugs. Offerors/contractors are not permitted to move the vessels.  If the contractor needed to shift a ship there would be a charge for these services which would be negotiated prior to contract award.  This charge would or could include a) removal of the vessel from the row, and b) if located in the center of a row; the cost of moving a new vessel into that spot for row continuity purposes. Except for ships located at the end of a row, each ship taken out of a row would require a ship from another position and possibly another row to be inserted in its place. This in effect necessitates a removal and placement of two ships.  The average time required for one evolution at JRRF is 745 man hours per event. This would be charged at the standard fleet hourly rate.
6. Question:  Does MARAD have a priority list for cleaning/defueling the ships?   In terms of priority, there is a list of the top 27 ships for disposal attached as an amendment to Announcement DTMA01E01001 posted on December 5, 2002. This list can be found on this web site under that announcement number.  However, MARAD is interested in reducing the overall quantity of oil and fuels in the entire fleet, and is also interested in innovations that would allow it to accomplish this goal. Therefore, proposals are not limited to these 27 high risk ships. 
7. Question:  Is the contractor responsible for re-ballasting the ship after fuel removal?  										      The contractor will be responsible for ballasting tanks and the final stability of the ship following the defueling and tank cleaning work.  Ballasting the tanks with river water is acceptable.
8. Question:  Who will provide line handlers during work? 			      The contractor shall provide the line handlers necessary to adjust mooring lines as pumping and ballasting changes the ship?s draft.  The JRRF would monitor this work.
9. Question:  What new hardware would have to be supplied as part of the work? 	Tank covers would have to be replaced using new gaskets.  Defective nuts, bolts and washers are also to be replaced.  The contractor should allow for a renewal of studs based on an inspection of the vessel prior to submitting their proposal.  Other existing hardware in serviceable condition can be reused.  In addition, any repairs necessary to close a tank will be required, so that offerors should survey conditions prior to submitting proposals.
10. Question:  To what standards would we have to clean the tanks? 		      The minimum standard for tank cleaning would be ?Safe for hot work?.  However, if offerors think they have another acceptable standard they should include and identify it in their proposal.
11.  Question:  Does MARAD have information on the quality and types of fuel in each tank?									      The quality and value of fuels in the ships are not known by the Government.  If the contractor wishes to take samples from a ship or ships before submitting a proposal, this may be done by arranging a site visit with the JRRF. The Government does have sounding figures estimating the amount of fuel in each tank, as well as capacity figures for each tank 
12. Question:  Will the oil/fuel piping have to be cleaned as part of the work?		 Pricing is desired for either or both of the following methods: a) sealing the oil piping using DC type, inflatable, or expandable plugs, and alternatively, b) flushing and cleaning the oil piping.
13.  Question:  Can information regarding soundings and tank capacity be made available?												This information is available from the JRRF upon request.  Contact Bob Rohr at (757) 887-3233 x17.
14. Question:  How much insurance will a contractor have to carry?  		     This depends on the method of cleaning and defueling that is proposed and the number of ships it will involve. 
15.  Question:  If a contractor submits a proposal for the February proposal(s) period, can they also submit a proposal(s) for the June submittal period? 			Yes.  Contractors are not restricted on the number of proposals they submit.                        




United States Government ?V Maritime Administration
Program Research and Develop Announcement (PRDA) 
for National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF)
Vessel Defueling/Removal and Tank Cleaning Solutions

Description:
The U.S. Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), South Atlantic Region, maintains ships stowage facilities for merchant and Navy ships at the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF), located on the James River at Fort Eustis, VA. These ships have become obsolete due to age and contain various amounts of fuels, oil, lubricants, oily water and ballast water in their tanks.  Some of the fuel tanks have leaks due to steel deterioration. 

MARAD is seeking innovative technical/management approaches to the environmentally safe and economically feasible defueling and removal of all petroleum products, as well as tank cleaning operations of obsolete vessels. (A complete listing of the vessels is attached for informational purposes as Attachment A. This list of ships is subject to change.)  In addition to conventional fuel removal and disposal and tank cleaning techniques, innovative solutions are invited that employ modern environmentally safe technology, including, but not limited to, safe chemical or bio-remediation techiques that dispose of residual fuel and other petroleum products.  Note that some listed ships (and/or components of listed ships) may be subject to a "hold" or "not available" status due to commitments for sales, loans, and donations which were made prior to procurement actions associated with this PRDA announcement.

Offerors may respond to one or both parts (i.e., defueling and/or tank cleaning) for any or all of the obsolete vessels listed on Attachment A.  Upon award, offerors will be required to identify the types of petroleum products, total quantity of the product, chemical analysis of the product, and the proposed methods of removal for the petroleum products from the vessel and their subsequent transportation to a disposal or recycling facility.  MARAD anticipates that the costs of this project will be partially offset by the resale value of the fuel or petroleum product.

Opportunities for Fleet Site Visits
MARAD has established two periods, January 27-29, 2003 and May 19-21, 2003, for interested parties to visit the JRRF and view the ships listed in Attachment A.  MARAD requests those interested in visiting the JRRF contact the point of contact (POC) not later than Friday, January 10, 2003 to register for the January 27-29 fleet site visit and not later than Friday, May 2, 2003 to register for the May 19-21 fleet sit visit.  The POC will request information regarding the identity of the visitors and information regarding the company/organization the visitor represents, and assign a time for the visit. The JRRF POC is Mr. Mike Bagley (757) 887-3233 Ext. 0, e-mail sharon.nesbit@marad.dot.gov.

Criteria for Evaluating/Selecting Proposals:
Proposals in response to this PRDA must address, at a minimum, the following:

?Y Innovative technical/management approaches for the environmentally safe and economically feasible defueling and/or tank cleaning of the vessels identified in Attachment A 
?Y Methodology for identifying the types, total quantity, chemical analysis, as well as the  removal and disposal of the petroleum products
?Y Production throughput/capacity with schedule and funding/cost relationships
?Y Offerors' requisite and relevant experience with fuel removal and/or tank cleaning on obsolete vessels
?Y Funding requirements associated with the proposed approach

In evaluating the offerors' submissions, the Government will consider the following criteria, listed in relative order of importance: 

?Y Feasibility and likelihood of success of technical/management approach for the removal/disposal of petroleum products and/or tank cleaning of the vessels identified in Attachment A and the risks associated with the proposed approach
?Y Economic feasibility of the proposed approach(es) including schedule/cost assessments
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed methodology for identification and chemical analysis of petroleum products
?Y Type and sufficiency of proposed removal/disposal of petroleum products and compliance with applicable laws
?Y Depth, relevance and currency of requisite experience with the removal/disposal of fuel/petroleum products and/or tank cleaning of obsolete vessels
?Y Realism and reasonableness of proposed funding requirements/costs when compared to the proposed technical/management approach(es)

In selecting proposed solution(s), the Government will evaluate the overall best value to the Government, considering innovative technical solution(s) meeting the above listed minimum criteria at a reasonable price. 

The PRDA process permits the Government to evaluate each proposal on its own merit and potentially negotiate the implementation of a Pilot Program(s) for proof of concept/methodology, as well as to provide justification for budgetary purposes to support a proposed program.  Unlike procedures associated with unsolicited proposals, submissions made under the PRDA will not be advertised and are considered confidential.  Based on the evaluation results and budgetary constraints, the Government may choose to select none, part of, or all of the proposal(s) to implement the innovative solutions offered. The Government has the right to select or refuse any or all of the offers.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR),  intends to enter into a (10) month contract extension with the Orkand Corporation, to provide uninterrupted continuation of clinical data management support to the 200 clinical trials conducted by the CCR clinical principal investigators and research teams.  The labor hours negotiated in the original contract were supposed to last until early 2004; however, they were used at an accelerated rate because of enhanced scrutiny and requirements of trial sponsors and regulatory agencies.  To ensure uninterrupted continuation of essential clinical research support, this non-competitive acquisition is proposed for a period of ten (10) months.  During this ensuing ten (10) month period the NCI intends to announce a full and open competition for its future requirements in this area, as a performance-based/award fee contract. During this time frame, the recompetition will be announced, and the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be found on the Research Contracts Branch home page. Proposals are not being requested at this time. No collect calls will be accepted.  Numbered Note 22 is referenced.

Thus, the resulting effort will not be a contract.  Offerors' attentions are directed to the original announcement, describing NASA's preference for a self-sustaining operations and to sections 203 (c )(5) and (c )(11) of the Space Act.  The prospective partners are requested to submit specific approaches as to how the objectives, outlined in the announcement, will be met.   <P> 2.  Is this still a competitive solicitation? <P> Yes. <P> 3.  Is our response to be in the form of a Space Act Agreement? <P> It is not necessary, but may be helpful.  NASA anticipates that negotiations will be necessary before an agreement is finalized. <P> 4.  Are there partnering requirements beyond those expressed in the subject solicitation? <P> No. <P> 5.  Would NASA prefer a single partnering organization to act as the prime contractor, and subcontract other organizations as needed?  Would NASA prefer instead to have several different partners involved, each providing a different aspect of the services described in the solicitation (with NASA GSFC acting as the prime integrator and manager of these contracts)? <P> NASA GSFC would prefer a partnering arrangement with a single organization that may or may not include collaboration with other organizations.  Whether or not an organization partners with other entities to meet NASA's objectives is the organization's business decision. <P> 6.  Would NASA entertain proposals specifically for creation and maintenance of exhibits (on site and traveling) or would you see that as only one part of a larger contract to develop the Visitor Center as a whole? <P> No, NASA GSFC is interested in proposals addressing all of the objectives of the announcement. <P> 7.  Although I am familiar with NASA's mission in general and that of Goddard in particular, I feel it would help me to be able to discuss the possibilities with someone at the GSFC Visitor Center.	Would it be possible for me to learn more about the specific interests and current resources of the Center by speaking or meeting with someone there in person?  Would Dr. Gabrys (mentioned in the solicitation as the point of contact for the existing ERC Space Act Agreement) be the appropriate person to contact in this regard? <P> A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for February 4, 2003, 9:00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m., at the Visitor Center.   <P> 8.  What is the current status of this solicitation?  Is this a requirement or RFEOI? <P> The subjthout Soil Conservation Service Road separating them.  The Visitor Center is expected to remain outside the NASA Goddard Security fence. <P> QUESTION: Will access to Visitor Center be off Soil Conservation Service Road or another road?  Will the entrance be off Greenbelt Road? <P> ANSWER: Access to the Visitor Center will be subject to negotiations.  <P> QUESTION: Would vendor employees be badged? <P> ANSWER: Yes, vendor employees will be badged based on the need to implement Visitor Center functions on Center. <P> QUESTION: Are you open to suggestions for the Gift Shop revenues?   <P> ANSWER: Yes, we are open to suggestions for the Gift Shop revenues.  <P> QUESTION: What is the net return from the Gift Shop for the past 3 years? <P> ANSWER: Information is not available as of this time. <P> QUESTION: Can the Visitor Center Gift Shop and the Center GEWA employee store be consolidated? <P> ANSWER: It will be considered if proposed in the context of recognizing the Goddard Employee's Welfare Association.   <P> QUESTION: Can we assume funds from other Federal and state business partners could be used to implement a proposal? <P> ANSWER: NASA will consider all usable, creative solutions aimed at meeting the objectives of the announcement, within the bounds of any appropriations law restrictions. <P> QUESTION: Is the Visitor center part of the Center's Partnering and Outreach Zone? <P> ANSWER: Not at the present time. <P> QUESTION: The disaster has helped us think of a potential name.  Does anything prevent us from using the term "Columbia Memorial?"   <P> ANSWER: We do not see any legal restrictions at present.  As a policy matter, we will consider it if proposed.  <P> QUESTION: Can photographs and movies be made of GSFC by the vendor?  <P> ANSWER: We will consider all creative approaches proposed by offerors.	 <P> QUESTION: Is there any advice on funding mechanisms? <P> ANSWER:   No.   <P> QUESTION: Can additional questions be submitted? <P> ANSWER: You may submit questions until February 21, 2003. <P> QUESTION: Who is the single point of contact? <P> ANSWER: Lourdes F. Carson Associate Division Chief, Institutional Programs Phone:	301-286-6871 Fax:	301-286-0237 E-mail: Lourdes.F.Carson@nasa.gov

<DESC>NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER VISITOR CENTER REQUEST FOR OFFERS (RFO) OPEN CONFERENCE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS <P> February 18, 2003 <P> QUESTION: Can you provide information on what Goddard Phase 2 categories of funding will be provided to continue the Visitor Center (VC) and Educator Resource Center (ERC)? <P> ANSWER: Goddard will not provide funding for the Visitor Center operating expenses.  Funding may be provided in the context of services purchased by GSFC (e.g., tours, conference space).  If so, this will be done by separate arrangement, not directly through the Agreement.  If the ERC is considered part of the final agreement then funding for those services would be under a separate agreement. <P> QUESTION: Is the funding amount going to be fixed or set per activity? <P> ANSWER: The amount of funding may be based on services procured through a separate procurement arrangement (e.g., tours, conference space).  GSFC has a continuing need to provide public access to the Visitor Center and its programs.  <P> QUESTION: Why is the government requiring commitments from vendors up front with no known return on investment? <P> ANSWER: Based on the feedback from the 2002 Request for Information (RFI), the commercial sector considered the commercialization of the Visitor Center a viable opportunity. <P> QUESTION: How would current visitors feel about being charged? <P> ANSWER:  Ultimately, that answer is a marketing responsibility of the bidders.  Based on the feedback from the 2002 RFI, the commercial sector considered the commercialization of the Visitor Center a viable opportunity.  We understand that the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center, Spaceport USA, was previously free to the public.	The operator now charges a fee. <P> QUESTION: How much more property would be available to the vendor and would it be limited to this building? <P> ANSWER:   We encourage offerors to propose creative and innovative approaches.  The successful offeror is not limited to the use of the existing buildings and property.   <P> QUESTION: Would the Center be open to improving visibility on the Center for tours?  For example, there is now a small window in the Building 7/10 Clean Room for viewing- can that be changed?   <P> ANSWER: We will consider all creative approaches proposed by offerors.	It is likely there may be negotiations before a final agreement is reached. <P> QUESTION: How many visitors are school children? <P> ANSWER: School children have represented 80 to 85 percent of the visitors since September 11, 2001. <P> QUESTION: Can you put together information including number of visitors and annual dollars spent? <P> ANSWER: Visitor Center Statistics 2000-2001: <P> General (walk-ins)			34419 School Groups (by appointment)		 9804 Public Groups (by appointment)		 5547 Special Events				 2790 <P> Last year we spent $450,000 on the contract.  However, the Government anticipates a self-sustaining effort.  Offerors should not assume the same level of Government commitment. QUESTION: Should one assume that the successful bidder would have access to all Goddard property? <P> ANSWER: The successful offeror's access to Goddard's property is contingent upon need, security, and safety regulations.  This matter is subject to negotiation. <P> QUESTION: Is the vendor responsible for the paved area and access road to the Visitor Center? <P> ANSWER: NASA would prefer that to be the case but it is up to the offeror's judgment. <P> QUESTION: What is the status on closing Soil Conservation Service Road? <P> ANSWER: Currently, procedures are underway to implement the Facilities Master Plan.  There is a published environmental announcement ( <A HREF="http://gsfc-facilities.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.html"> http://gsfc-facilities.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.html</A>  ).  The design process has begun.  While the specific closure date is not fixed now, it is currently anticipated to be at least a year from now.  The expressed intent of the Center is to combine both campuses wiect announcement is requesting offers for a Space Act Agreement with NASA GSFC. The revised deadline for submitting proposals is February 28, 2003. <P> 9.  Is this requirement, or any portion of it, set-aside for small business? <P> No.   <P> 10.  Are there specific participation target goals in the desired "partnership" arrangement for (1) small businesses, (2) small disadvantaged businesses, (3) woman-owned businesses, (4) HBCUs or other minority-serving institutions?  If so, please provide the specific targets for each of the above categories? <P> No.   <P> 11.  Is there currently a specific date by which proposals from offerors are due?  Approximately, when do you anticipate that an award will be made for this requirement? <P> The revised proposal deadline is February 28, 2003.  Upon review of all proposals, NASA anticipates signing an agreement with the successful partner as soon as possible, following negotiations. <P> 12.  What is meant by public/private partnership?  Will this be a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other?	   <P> NASA anticipates entering into a Space Act agreement, which may or may not be a cooperative agreement.  Offerors' attentions are directed to the original announcement, describing NASA's preference for self-sustaining operations and to sections 203 (c)(5) and (c)(11) of the Space Act. <P> 13.  Who currently operates the Visitor's Center?  <P> Wright Solutions, Inc. is currently contracted to operate the Visitor Center. <P> 14.  Will this requirement result in the creation of a consortium involving the educational community, community-based organizations, private industry, etc.? <P> It is a prospective organization's business decision whether to create a consortium involving both public and private sector organizations. <P> 15.  In the special notice, there is reference to sites for hosting various Symposia, conferences, and other special events, are site locations such as hotels, conference centers, university meeting spaces, etc. to be considered?  <P> Yes. NASA will consider all creative solutions proposed by offerors to meet the objectives of the announcement. <P> 16.  With respect to the aforementioned requirement regarding a site(s) for hosting various events, will the selected contractor be responsible for the planning and management of these conferences or is there is NASA entity that will be responsible for these tasks?  What types of meeting planning/management opportunities are there with this requirement? <P> The subject announcement does not include the planning and management of NASA conferences.  The announcement does address the potential objective of making conference space available. <P> 17.  The FedBizOpps announcement of 12/27/02 did not specify either a requirement for a response or a date for a proposal. Can you tell me if a solicitation will be forthcoming shortly, or is a solicitation available at some other site? It does not seem that the 12/27/02 Notice is the solicitation; can you help clarify for me, please? <P> The response date stated in the solicitation was February 15, 2003.  The revised response date is February 28, 2003.  The subject announcement requests offers for a Space Act Agreement with NASA GSFC.  Thus, the resulting effort will not be a contract.   <P> 18.  Are you inviting people to submit their capability specs and you will put the consortium together, or are you inviting a consortium to submit?  If the later, how do I get in contact with prospective consortia? <P> NASA GSFC is requesting an organization to provide a proposal in response to the announcement.  If an organization desires to use the approach of a consortium to meet the requirements of the announcement, it is the company's responsibility to create a consortium. <P> 19.  Unlike the recent RFI for the VC, this posting does not contain general instructions for responding to the Government.	 <P> The subject announcement and this document provide all the information necessary to formulate proposals meeting the objectives of the announcement. <P> 20.  How do you think you will approach working with an architectural firm with regard to the development of this project? Will you rely on the selected "Partner" to bring on board an architect? Or is there one already selected?  If not, can we meet with you or the appropriate party to introduce our firm, as we would like to be considered for any architectural services needed? Perhaps we can be of help initially for planning and budget estimates, etc.	 If you expect the "Partner" to team with an architect - can I find out whom the interested parties are so that I can determine who to contact to team with?  <P> It is the prospective offeror's business decision to form a partnership with other organizations as part of the approach to meeting all the objectives of the announcement.  If an offeror desires to collaborate with other entities, it is that offeror's responsibility to locate potential partners.

The program's priorities will be the improved capacity of young people to function in a working environment, developing and implementing market-based technical/vocational training and job placement programs, and strengthening existing service networks that address related needs of vulnerable youth. Since 1994, USAID/Brazil has been supporting activities that assist disadvantaged children and adolescents.  More than 60,000 children have benefited from USAID's program to date in areas such as social services and psychological counseling to victims of sexual exploitation and abuse; prevention and eradication of child labor and sexual trafficking in youth; and vocational training for increased employability of youth. While results have been considerable in a number of these areas, USAID believes it is time to consolidate the lessons learned into a more focused strategy designed to provide disadvantaged youth with the technical training, related life skills, and job placement support needed to secure viable employment in the formal sector.  Institutions, contractors, for profit and non-profit organizations that may be interested in participating in this disadvantaged youth program to be implemented in Brazil are requested to contact USAID/Bolivia. Interested institutions must be able to achieve results in the following areas: (i) marketable skills training for at-risk youth increased; and (ii) access of at-risk youth to formal market employment opportunities increased. USAID/Brazil encourages qualified offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  We anticipate issuing the RFA o/a March 10, 2003. Application due date will be May 2, 2003.

<DESC>NA This is a market research to locate sources for the acquisition of the Depot Level Contractor Logistic repair for Ground Data Terminal (GDT) and Spares.   The GDT is part of the Joint STARS Surveillance and Control Data Link (SCDL).  The GDT is used with t he Joint STARS Common Ground Station (CGS) or equivalent.  An Air Data Terminal (ADT) and one or more GDT are required to establish a two-way communications net between the Joint STARS aircraft and one or more Joint STARS ground stations.  The ADT omni-dir ectionally broadcasts KU-band digital Frequency Modulation downlink signals.  The GDT acquire the transmitted signals to permit continuous display of Joint STARS sensor information at the ground stations.  The ADT also receives KU-band digital uplink signa ls from the GDT.  This system employs anti-jam features and encryption/decryption.  Detailed technical data is not available for the GDT and spares.  Suppliers capable of providing the depot logistic support must respond by writing to Commander, USA CECOM,  ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-C-JS, Building 1201E, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000.  The response must include documentations to prove capability of performing this service, a proof of prior experience with this system or equivalence, a proof of being capable of opera ting and using the related test equipments, and a proof of having the capability of proper diagnostics such fault detection, fault isolation, etc.  Successful bidder may be required to warrant that the items repaired will satisfactorily perform when used f or the purpose intended by the Army.

<DESC>NA The US Army Soldier Biological and Chemical Command, Soldier System Center (SBCCOM-SSC) in Natick, MA, is conducting a market survey for technical information from foreign vendors on a High Altitude-Low Opening/High Altitude-High Opening (HALO/HAHO) Naviga tion Aid that will allow Special Operations Forces (SOF) infiltration capabilities in all environmental situations. Currently teams have little ability to navigate to a target unless it is seen at exit, or the Air Crew releases (gives a green light) at the  perfect Computer Aided Release Point (CARP). In the event of cloud cover the infiltrating team is not sure of actual position until breaking through the cloud cover, sometimes as low as 2000 ft AGL. At this point the team is committed to land whether at t he intended target or not.  These types of infiltrations are not conducted or even practiced in the optimum conditions, which reduce the possibility of detection, clouds, rain, and snow. Instead they are done for the most part in clear skies.    The science and technology effort in the area of applied research and experimental development being considered is on the order of $0.45M per year for one year. Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. All interested for eign firms, regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this request for information. It should be noted that this is a market survey and not a pre-solicitation notice. A pre-solicitation notice will be published if a formal solicitation is generated.   No awards will result from this market survey. Nothing shall be construed herein or through the market survey process to commit or obligate the U.S. Government to further action as a result of this market survey.

Scope:  The dual L-band antenna that will be used on the Mod 7 Instrumentation Wafer is designed and built by the Electromagnetic Systems Branch at the Physical Science Laboratory (PSL).  The antennas are designed to fit the curve of the MM III rocket profile, and receive the L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L2 (1227.6 MHz) frequencies transmitted from the Global Positioning System  (GPS) satellites.  The basic microstrip patch antenna radome cover has been modified to be a thicker material, and is more heat resistant than their standard line of antennas. All antennas in the 2220 MHz region are manufactured from the same artwork, but are tuned to meet the Government requirements.

Use:  The antenna will be part of the GPS tracking system used by the Western Range to track the MM III Force Development and Evaluation (FDE) flight test flown from Vandenberg AFB. This antenna is used for real time location of the missile from lift-off until NS-50 computer shut down.

<DESC>Note that a previous sources sought synopsis for Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) for the National Transonic Facility was posted May 15, 2002. (SS-LN2) Due to a possibility that NASA, Langley Research Center may be able to provide on-site housing for Contractor LN2 production, NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is hereby soliciting additional information from potential sources to provide Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) on or after April 1, 2004 for use in the National Transonic Facility, a research wind tunnel at LaRC and the 0.3m Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel. The following is a description of these facilities, NASA's LN2 requirements, and historical usage:	The National Transonic Facility (NTF) and the 0.3M Transonic Cryogenic Tunnel (0.3M-TCT) are closed circuit, fan driven cryogenic pressure wind tunnels.	The both operate at cryogenic temperatures by injecting LN2 in to the tunnel circuit.  More information about these facilities can be found at www.larc.nasa.gov or        http://wte.larc.nasa.gov	. The NTF has two large capacity on-site LN2 storage dewars.  The small size LN2 storage dewar (built in 1979) can hold approximately 800 tons of LN2 and the large size dewar (built in 1997) can hold 3000 tons of LN2.  Both dewars are constantly maintained at a positive pressure (~5psig) and require a minimum liquid level of 6% for the 800 ton dewar and 2% for the 3000 ton dewar.   The 3000 ton dewar provides the main LN2 storage for the NTF.  This dewar receives LN2 directly from an off-site commercial LN2 production facility via an external 4.0 inch ID vacuum jacketed pipeline. The 800 ton dewar is the NTF "Run" dewar and provides all LN2 prior to injection into the tunnel.  The NTF can empty this dewar at a maximum rate of 32.4 tons per minute (9400 gallons per minute (GPM)), using three different size LN2 pumps. This dewar is primarily filled by a pipeline coming directly from the 3000 ton dewar at a maximum rate of 4.2 tons per minute (1250 GPM).  Additionally, the 800 ton dewar can receive LN2 directly from an off-site commercial LN2 production facility via an external 4.0 inch ID vacuum jacketed pipeline (however, this pipeline typically is used to supply the 3000 ton dewar).	There are also four trucking off-loading stations capable of filling the 800 ton dewar at 0.84 tons per minute (250 GPM).   The 0.3M TCT has two on-site 94 ton LN2 storage dewars.  These storage dewars (built in 1960, modified in 1990) are maintained at a positive pressure (~10 psig) and have no required minimum liquid level.  These dewars are primarily filled directly from an off-site commercial LN2 production facility via an external 2.0 inch ID vacuum jacketed pipeline. There is also one truck off loading station capable of filling the 94 ton dewars at 0.34 tons per minute (100 GPM). NTF Testing Scenario A typical test sequence will start on Monday (with 3800tons available on-site storage) and run through the following Friday using LN2.  During this 5 day period the contractor will be required to replenish the NTF onsite storage at a delivery rate of 700ton/day.  For the next 9 days (4 weekend days and 5 business days) the contractor will re-fill the NTF on-site storage (3800ton). The next Monday the NTF will start and run through the following Friday using LN2.  During this 5 day period the contractor will be required to replenish the NTF onsite storage at a delivery rate of 700ton/day.

<SUBJECT>66 -- IR CAMERAS FOR QUALISYS MOTION CAPTURE SYSTEM
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE -- The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  (NIOSH), Engineering & Control Technology Branch in Morgantown, WV has a need to enhance the capabilities of their current Qualisys motion capture system to include four (4) additional MCU 120Hz Pro Reflex Cameras.  The current Qualisys system includes software and four (4) cameras.  The IR cameras will allow NIOSH to record the  biomechanics of the human body in a variety of situations that are currently not feasible.  At least two (2) cameras must be present at all times on every marker placed on the body, preferably three (3) for assurance.  When performing a twisting and lifting motion, it is not currently possible to track all the balls on a persons body.  This situation is further compounded by objects within the test space, such as tables and boxes, that can block a cameras view.   With the four (4) additional cameras, NIOSH will be able to place them so that the balls are tracked continuously.   Since NIOSH conducted a competitive solicitation to acquire the current motion capture system, and the Qualisys system was selected, the additional cameras must be Qualisys as well in order to be compatible with the existing system's hardware and software.   The only know source to obtain these cameras is Innovision Systems Inc., Columbiaville, MI., therefore, the Government intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis.  Innovision Systems is the Qualisys sales representative for North America.   Organizations that believe they can provide totally compatible cameras may respond within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice.   Sufficient information shall be provided for the Government to determine compatibility.   Responses shall be submitted to:   Brenda Goodwin   (MS-1019), Reference: #2003-Q-00792, DHHS, PHS, CDC,  NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.   This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.  Information received would generally be used for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no responses are received within 10 days, award will be made to Innovision Systems, Inc. without further notices being issued.   All responses received shall be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>75 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status. We are proposing to add: Markers, Dry Erase, Chisel Tip, Set of 8 (7520-00-NIB-0661).  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Oxidizer Gels for Detoxification of Chemical and Biological Agents
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS COLLABORATIVE R & D PARTNERS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE OXIDIZER GELS FOR DETOXIFICATION OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL AGENTS

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks collaborative research and development partner(s) to further develop and commercialize its gelled liquid oxidizer system for decontamination of chemical and biological agents. 

LLNL has developed and tested a sprayable gel that has been demonstrated to destroy all types of chemical and biological agents. Independent tests against chemical nerve agents (both ?G? and ?V?), sulfur mustard, and the biological agents plague (y.pestis), antrax (b. anthracis) and other infectious organisms and viruses have conclusively shown the effectiveness of this decontaminant.

Oxidizer colloidal gels can be used for detoxification of chemical or biological agents from terrorist attacks, accidental release, or military applications.  They are specifically designed to decontaminate walls, ceilings, and floors of buildings or open areas where the agents have been applied to surfaces. They could also be used for recovery of contaminated equipment.  The material can be used for general decontamination/clean-up of hospitals and as a potential disinfectant for home use. Simple kits can be prepared for emergency use as required.

Oxidizing gels are more environmentally acceptable than current methods and results in non-toxic byproducts. Oxidizing gels could be applied by simplex or air assisted sprayers, rollers, brushes or other techniques. This can clean up hidden contamination in ductwork or inaccessible cracks.  It dries to a powder form in 4-6 hours making clean-up as simple as washing down with soap and water or removed by vacuuming up the non-hazardous residue.  

For additional technical information:

Read U. S. Patent 6,455,751, ?Oxidizer Gels for Detoxification of Chemical and Biological Agents?, issued 9/24/02.

See PDF File for report UCRL-AR-143212, ?Oxidative Decontamination of Chemical and Biological Agents Using L-Gel? , July 2001.

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in developing and commercializing LLNL's technology gelled liquid oxidizer system for decontamination of chemical and biological agents should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
	1.	Company Name and address.
	2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing
	this technology.
4.	Experience in obtaining appropriate Government approvals, permits, and
 registrations. 

Written responses should be directed to:
