Interior Design:     a. Interior finishes in the Morgue will be smooth and impermeable to moisture. Gypsum wallboard will be sealed with an epoxy paint. The floor and bases latex mastic and the bases shall be coved for easy cleaning.     b. The Bio-Med rooms are to receive new carpet flooring, rubber floor base, painted walls, demountable partitions, and acoustical ceiling panel system. The toilet rooms will have painted gypsum board ceilings and ceramic tile walls and floors.4. Fire Protection:     a. The existing building is fully sprinklered.  Proposed renovations will require minor relocation and/or addition of sprinkler heads to adequately cover the revised spaces.  All fire suppression renovations will be in accordance with NFPA 13.5. Plumbing Systems:     a. Proposed renovations include the addition of floor drains and one utility sink to serve the proposed Morgue.  The present building cold and hot water systems appear adequate for the renovations spaces.  Domestic cold and hot water piping, sanitary piping, and vent piping shall be tied to existing piping in the adjacent SPD building.  Domestic supply piping will be Type K copper routed overhead where possible.  Drain and vent piping (where hidden) will be Schedule 40 PVC.  All plumbing piping and fittings will conform to the 2006 Michigan Plumbing Code and VA Standards, as applicable.6. HVAC Systems:     a. The present heating system consists of one steam unit heater for the storage room.  This unit, and associated piping, will be removed.     b. The adjacent SPD building HVAC system (currently in process of remodel) will consist of a 100% exhaust/tempered make-up air system ducted to all spaces.  Heating will be provided by hot water duct reheat coils controlled by individual thermostats.  The SPD air handling unit and hot water system have been sized to accommodate the proposed Morgue/Future Autopsy additional cooling and heating loads.  Of special note, the Sterile Storage spaces in SPD were originally designed to receive 10 air changes per hour.  Revised rules for the spaces allowed this value to be reduced to 4 air changes per hour.  The air handler will accommodate both the SPD high air flow rate and the addition of the proposed Morgue/Future Autopsy space.     c. The proposed HVAC system will consist of two parts:  a split cooling system for the morgue refrigerator itself and a ducted air system for the remainder of the space.  The Morgue cooling system will be specific to the Morgue unit with cooling equipment sized by the Morgue manufacturer.  A roof-mounted condenser will serve the Morgue cooler.  The balance of the renovated space will be sized for a possible future Morgue/Autopsy space with minimum of 10 air changes per hour directly exhausted.       d. The adjacent proposed SPD 100% exhaust air system has been sized to accommodate this potential additional cooling and heating load.  Ductwork will be connected from supply and exhaust trunks within SPD to the Morgue addition.       e. Air will be supplied to the space at 55 deg F, with heat provided by a hot water reheat duct coil.  The coil will be controlled by a wall-mounted thermostat in the space.  Morgue cooling will be independently controlled by a space thermostat.  Heating hot water piping will be connected to the SPD hot water system.     f. Both morgue and adjacent space temperature will be monitored and capable of being controlled by a building management system serving the SPD.     g. The ductwork for the new Morgue area has been designed taking into consideration potential room subdivisions within the space.  The 10 air changes are specific to the Morgue/Autopsy future area.  The balance of the space has been designed for 4 air changes per hour.7. Electrical Systems:     a. The existing electrical distribution equipment is 480/277 volt,  three phase and originates in the electrical room in the SW corner of the building.  The main distribution panel on the first floor serves the chiller and also distributes 480/277 three phase to the penthouse for HVAC and other equipment.  In the penthouse the 480V is transformed down to 120/208 volt three phase to distribute 120/208 volt power out to panelboards to feed the kitchen equipment and other power devices.  Lighting is primarily 277 volt fed from separate lighting panels.     b. With the current Relocate SPD project the electrical distribution will be changed.  After the completion of the SPD project the Main distribution will remain in the SW Electrical room with distribution of 480/277 three phase to the penthouse where new panels and transformers will be installed to distribute 480/277 and 120/208 to existing and new panelboards located in the renovated SPD area.  Along with the new equipment standby generator power will be added to the facility by connecting the 120/208v three phase distribution panel to the existing generator in Building 136 and providing a generator receptacle on the exterior to provide 480/277 power to the rest of the building.       c. The electrical system at the completion of the SPD project will be able to operate the new Morgue and supporting equipment. There is a 120/208V three phase panel in the room where the Morgue will be located.  The panel currently powers kitchen equipment that will be removed with the SPD project.      d. New power and lighting equipment will be fed from the existing panel spare circuit breakers or new circuit breakers installed in the existing panel.     e. Unless otherwise noted, interior lighting in finished areas will consist of ceiling mounted fluorescent fixtures with electronic ballasts and T-8 lamps.      f. Telephone outlets will be provided as described in the Room Descriptions in the Project Manual.  Modular jacks will be provided at each outlet and a continuous, unspliced, eight conductor, unshielded twisted pair cable routed in raceway from the outlet to the existing telephone backboard located in the First Floor Electrical Room.       g. Computer system LAN outlets will be provided as described in the Room Descriptions in the Project Manual.  Connectors will be provided at each outlet and a continuous, unspliced, eight conductor, unshielded twisted pair cable routed in raceway from the outlet to the existing LAN backboard located in the First Floor Electrical Room. 8. Medical Gas Bulk Storage:     a. The existing bulk tanks, on the southwest side of Building 7, will be relocated to the area between Buildings 136 and Building 13.  The current medical gas supplier is BOC; coordination with BOC will be required to determine bulk storage requirements.  A new concrete pad will be provided to meet BOC requirements with a new drive for truck access.  The area will be fenced.  Power will be provided as required.  The existing bulk tank monitoring equipment, currently located in Building 7, will be relocated to Building 136 or replaced as necessary.  A location for the monitor must be determined.The period of performance is 180 calendar days. Magnitude of construction is expected to be between $250,000 and $500,000.NAICS Code: 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building ConstructionThe solicitation documents including specifications and drawings will be issued on or about April 22, 2009.

(D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.<BR><BR>Registered in the CCR database means that--<BR><BR>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and<BR><BR>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active'. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.<BR><BR>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.<BR><BR>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.<BR><BR>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.<BR><BR>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--<BR><BR>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or<BR><BR>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<DESC>RECOVERY: DIGITAL TELEVISION (DTV) TRANSITION FOR EXPERT,          
                        COMPLEX IN-HOME DIGITAL TRANSITION SERVICES
                      Region 1:  Pacific (AK, AZ, CA, ID, NV, OR, UT, WA)

PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND TELEPHONE REQUEST OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5 simplified acquisition procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov). North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 238210 and Size Standard of 
$14 Million apply to this solicitation. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in the final stage of implementing the congressionally mandated nationwide transition to digital broadcast television.  Approximately one-third of the Nations 1800 full-power television stations have already completed this transition.  The remaining two-thirds of full-power broadcast television stations will transition on or before June 12, 2009.

In the television markets where the digital television (DTV) transition has been completed, the FCC has learned that most individuals and households can successfully make the transition by following instructions provided with their digital-to-analog converter box or by accessing mass media materials (such as information found on the FCCs and other entities Internet sites, fact sheets and other printed materials available in libraries and community centers, calls to FCC or broadcast station help lines, or informational/demonstration programs presented by FCC staff, local television stations, and community groups).

This RFQ seeks quotations for expert in-home digital transition services.  Such services include, but are not limited to, the following elements  connecting up to two of a households existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes to existing broadcast antenna(s) and analog TV(s); making significant adjustments to and movement of existing antennas; scanning and rescanning converter boxes to locate the maximum number of digital broadcast channels available; integrating an existing VCR into the installation; and providing guidance to the consumer on the operation of his or her converter box(es), including the use of closed captioning features.  Such services may include integrating two existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes and an existing VCR into the installation so that the consumer can watch one broadcast program while recording another. Statistical evidence suggests that certain geographical areas of the country are less prepared than others.  Thus, this solicitation also prefers proposals targeted to the geographical communities identified in the attached statement of work and is seeking proposals that focus on providing digital transition assistance to low-income individuals, minority communities, non-English speaking consumers, senior citizens, consumers living in rural areas or on tribal lands, and consumers with disabilities.   

Proposals are requested from all potential offerors, regardless of whether they qualify as small business concerns or Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns under Small Business Administration regulations, 13 C.F.R. Parts 121 and 126. However, the FCC will make awards using cascading HUBZone and small business set-asides, as described in Method for Award-Cascading Set Asides, before considering awards to offerors other than small businesses. METHOD FOR AWARDCASCADING SET-ASIDES Multiple awards will be made resulting from this solicitation using the following cascading set-aside order of preference: (1) In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.13, awards will be made on a competitive basis first to responsible, certified HUBZone small business concerns. (2) Following step (1), additional awards will be made on a competitive basis in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5 to responsible, eligible small business concerns. (3) If the contract awards under steps (1) and (2) above do not provide in-home installation services sufficient to meet the Governments needs throughout the geographic area covered by this solicitation, additional awards will be made on a full and open competition basis to responsible offerors. 

The deadline for this solicitation is April 15, 2009 3:00 EST.  Please submit any questions before 12:00PM Noon EST, on April 10, 2009.  Submit offers or any questions to eProposals@fcc.gov.  Offerors who fail to complete and submit all requirements may be considered non-responsive.

NOTE: Not-for-profit organizations are eligible to submit quotations and be considered for award in the full and open competition phase of our award process (once awards have been made to SBA certified HUBZone small businesses and other small business concerns). 

The government intends to award multiple firm-fixed price contracts. The Period of Performance for these contracts is estimated to start mid May 2009 through July 31, 2009 with special emphasis on an 8-week period identified within the statement of work (SOW). See attached file containing SOW, proposal/quote instructions and evaluation criteria.

<DESC>RECOVERY: DIGITAL TELEVISION (DTV) TRANSITION FOR EXPERT,          
                     COMPLEX IN-HOME DIGITAL TRANSITION SERVICES
                     Region 3:  Southwest (AR, LA, NM, OK, PR, TX)

PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND TELEPHONE REQUEST OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5 simplified acquisition procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov). North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 238210 and Size Standard of 
$14 Million apply to this solicitation. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in the final stage of implementing the congressionally mandated nationwide transition to digital broadcast television.  Approximately one-third of the Nations 1800 full-power television stations have already completed this transition.  The remaining two-thirds of full-power broadcast television stations will transition on or before June 12, 2009.

In the television markets where the digital television (DTV) transition has been completed, the FCC has learned that most individuals and households can successfully make the transition by following instructions provided with their digital-to-analog converter box or by accessing mass media materials (such as information found on the FCCs and other entities Internet sites, fact sheets and other printed materials available in libraries and community centers, calls to FCC or broadcast station help lines, or informational/demonstration programs presented by FCC staff, local television stations, and community groups).

This RFQ seeks quotations for expert in-home digital transition services.  Such services include, but are not limited to, the following elements  connecting up to two of a households existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes to existing broadcast antenna(s) and analog TV(s); making significant adjustments to and movement of existing antennas; scanning and rescanning converter boxes to locate the maximum number of digital broadcast channels available; integrating an existing VCR into the installation; and providing guidance to the consumer on the operation of his or her converter box(es), including the use of closed captioning features.  Such services may include integrating two existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes and an existing VCR into the installation so that the consumer can watch one broadcast program while recording another. Statistical evidence suggests that certain geographical areas of the country are less prepared than others.  Thus, this solicitation also prefers proposals targeted to the geographical communities identified in the attached statement of work and is seeking proposals that focus on providing digital transition assistance to low-income individuals, minority communities, non-English speaking consumers, senior citizens, consumers living in rural areas or on tribal lands, and consumers with disabilities.   

Proposals are requested from all potential offerors, regardless of whether they qualify as small business concerns or Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns under Small Business Administration regulations, 13 C.F.R. Parts 121 and 126. However, the FCC will make awards using cascading HUBZone and small business set-asides, as described in Method for Award-Cascading Set Asides, before considering awards to offerors other than small businesses. METHOD FOR AWARDCASCADING SET-ASIDES Multiple awards will be made resulting from this solicitation using the following cascading set-aside order of preference: (1) In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.13, awards will be made on a competitive basis first to responsible, certified HUBZone small business concerns. (2) Following step (1), additional awards will be made on a competitive basis in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5 to responsible, eligible small business concerns. (3) If the contract awards under steps (1) and (2) above do not provide in-home installation services sufficient to meet the Governments needs throughout the geographic area covered by this solicitation, additional awards will be made on a full and open competition basis to responsible offerors. 

Please submit any questions before 12:00 PM Noon Eastern, on April 10, 2009.  Submit offers or any questions to eProposals@fcc.gov.  Offerors who fail to complete and submit all requirements may be considered non-responsive.

<DESC>RECOVERY: DIGITAL TELEVISION (DTV) TRANSITION FOR EXPERT,          
                        COMPLEX IN-HOME DIGITAL TRANSITION SERVICES
                      Region 1:  Pacific (AK, AZ, CA, ID, NV, OR, UT, WA)

PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND TELEPHONE REQUEST OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5 simplified acquisition procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov). North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 238210 and Size Standard of 
$14 Million apply to this solicitation. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in the final stage of implementing the congressionally mandated nationwide transition to digital broadcast television.  Approximately one-third of the Nations 1800 full-power television stations have already completed this transition.  The remaining two-thirds of full-power broadcast television stations will transition on or before June 12, 2009.

In the television markets where the digital television (DTV) transition has been completed, the FCC has learned that most individuals and households can successfully make the transition by following instructions provided with their digital-to-analog converter box or by accessing mass media materials (such as information found on the FCCs and other entities Internet sites, fact sheets and other printed materials available in libraries and community centers, calls to FCC or broadcast station help lines, or informational/demonstration programs presented by FCC staff, local television stations, and community groups).

This RFQ seeks quotations for expert in-home digital transition services.  Such services include, but are not limited to, the following elements  connecting up to two of a households existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes to existing broadcast antenna(s) and analog TV(s); making significant adjustments to and movement of existing antennas; scanning and rescanning converter boxes to locate the maximum number of digital broadcast channels available; integrating an existing VCR into the installation; and providing guidance to the consumer on the operation of his or her converter box(es), including the use of closed captioning features.  Such services may include integrating two existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes and an existing VCR into the installation so that the consumer can watch one broadcast program while recording another. Statistical evidence suggests that certain geographical areas of the country are less prepared than others.  Thus, this solicitation also prefers proposals targeted to the geographical communities identified in the attached statement of work and is seeking proposals that focus on providing digital transition assistance to low-income individuals, minority communities, non-English speaking consumers, senior citizens, consumers living in rural areas or on tribal lands, and consumers with disabilities.   

Proposals are requested from all potential offerors, regardless of whether they qualify as small business concerns or Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns under Small Business Administration regulations, 13 C.F.R. Parts 121 and 126. However, the FCC will make awards using cascading HUBZone and small business set-asides, as described in Method for Award-Cascading Set Asides, before considering awards to offerors other than small businesses. METHOD FOR AWARDCASCADING SET-ASIDES Multiple awards will be made resulting from this solicitation using the following cascading set-aside order of preference: (1) In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.13, awards will be made on a competitive basis first to responsible, certified HUBZone small business concerns. (2) Following step (1), additional awards will be made on a competitive basis in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5 to responsible, eligible small business concerns. (3) If the contract awards under steps (1) and (2) above do not provide in-home installation services sufficient to meet the Governments needs throughout the geographic area covered by this solicitation, additional awards will be made on a full and open competition basis to responsible offerors. 

Please submit any questions before 12:00 PM Noon Eastern, on April 10, 2009.  Submit offers or any questions to eProposals@fcc.gov.  Offerors who fail to complete and submit all requirements may be considered non-responsive.

NOTE: Not-for-profit organizations are eligible to submit quotations and be considered for award in the full and open competition phase of our award process (once awards have been made to SBA certified HUBZone small businesses and other small business concerns). 

The government intends to award multiple firm-fixed price contracts. The Period of Performance for these contracts is estimated to start mid May 2009 through July 31, 2009 with special emphasis on an 8-week period identified within the statement of work (SOW). See attached file containing SOW, proposal/quote instructions and evaluation criteria.
