<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis services to evaluate the ability of 12-months of exercise to influence circulating estrogen levels and estrogen metabolism in postmenopausal women from Craft Technologies, Inc., 4344 Frank Price Church Road, Wilson, NC 27893.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $14.0 Million.
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has developed a stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay for measuring concurrently all 15 estrogens and estrogen metabolites (EM) in human serum, in both unconjugated+conjugated and unconjugated only forms, with high sensitivity, validity, and reproducibility (Xu X et al, Anal Chem 2007 79:7813-21). The specific EM include the parent estrogens (estrone and estradiol); metabolites in the 2-hydroxylation pathway (2-hydroxyestrone, 2-methoxyestrone, 2-hydroxyestradiol, 2-methoxyestradiol, and 2-hydroxyestrone-3-methyl ether); metabolites in the 4-hydroxylation pathway (4-hydroxyestrone, 4-methoxyestrone, and 4-methoxyestradiol); and metabolites in the 16-hydroxylation pathway (16a-hydroxyestrone, estriol, 17-epiestriol, 16-ketoestradiol, and 16-epiestriol). Laboratory and clinical studies have suggested that specific estrogen metabolism profiles and/or specific estrogen metabolites may play a role in breast cancer etiology. Development of the LC-MS/MS assay allowed for the first time robust tests of these hypotheses about estrogen metabolism in population studies.</p>
<p>The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch proposes to conduct the first study of exercise and estrogen metabolism in postmenopausal women using a comprehensive serum-based measure of all 15 EM. The Alberta Physical Activity and Breast Cancer Prevention (ALPHA) Trial randomized 320 postmenopausal women to either 12 months of aerobic exercise or a control group. Study retention was excellent (96% completion) and exercise adherence was exceptional (exercisers averaged 178.5&thinsp;min/week of aerobic exercise). Women in the exercise condition increased cardiorespiratory fitness by 14%, lost 2.4 kg of body fat, and had lower circulating estradiol and higher sex hormone-binding globulin at 12 months.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>1) Assay total (conjugated+unconjugated) concentrations of 15 estrogens/estrogen metabolites (EM) in 688 serum (sample volume=0.3 mL) samples from postmenopausal women participating in the randomized ALPHA Trial. Results from each batch of 43 samples (40 unknowns + 3 blinded quality control materials) shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) within three working days of completion of the assays.</p>
<p>To the DCEG's knowledge, Craft Technologies, Inc. is the only laboratory that has developed an assay for the 15 circulating estrogens and estrogen metabolites (EM) in serum samples with 1) sensitivity adequate to measure all 15 EM in postmenopausal women, 2) high reproducibility (&le; 10% coefficients of variation, including all steps of the procedure, for estrone, estradiol, and most of the estrogen metabolites), 3) demonstrated accuracy, based on calibration of the estradiol measurements with the Centers for Disease Control Hormone Standardization Program, and 4) low sample volume requirements (&le; 0.3 mL for each assay). <br /><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 11 AM EST, on August 25, 2014. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed 240-276-5399 or emailed to Reyes Rodriguez, Contracting Specialist via electronic mail at <a href="mailto:reyes.rodriguez@nih.gov">reyes.rodriguez@nih.gov</a>.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Standardization Action (SA) for the standardization of Syringes With Needle Combinations Permanent. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MN-1309-23_Syringes_with_Needle_Combinations Permanent are eligible for participation. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Syringes With Needle Combinations Permanent products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL <br />MN-1309-23_Syringes_with_Needle_Combinations Permanent. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is September 2014. Among vendors who are on the QSLIAN-1406-24_Syringe_With_Needle_Combinations_Permanent,best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements.</strong> The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Syringes With Needle Combinations Permanent.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Syringes With Needle Combinations Permanent. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $661,258 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on the QSL MN-1309-23_Syringes_with_Needle_Combinations Permanent who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO North via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor must complete and submit the IA FBO Package Worksheet. A vendor who cannot open the IA FBO Package Worksheet may contact either of the MMESO POCs below and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. The Government intends to make a selection based on initial quotes but reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br />The pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete pricing offer and vendor information must be submitted in full by the response date of this Sources Sought Notification. <strong>Vendors not currently on the QSL for Syringes With Needle Combinations Permanent will not be considered for an IA. Vendor pricing and packaging MUST match those that were submitted and qualified to the QSL FBO MN-1309-23_Syringes_with_Needle_Combinations Permanent. Use these instructions to complete the IA FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</strong></p>

<p>3. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by the terms of the DAPA to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements.
