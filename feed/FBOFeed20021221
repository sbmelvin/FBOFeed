COMBAT EQUIPPED JUMPER.  An aircraft passenger rigged with a main parachute, reserve parachute, weapon, and ALICE pack (back-pack) to parachute from an aircraft.  The planning weight for a combat equipped jumper is as follows:  Weight of average jumper = 180 lbs., Weight of parachute with reserve = 40 lbs., Weight of ALICE pack and weapon = 80 lbs.  Total Average Planning Weight per Combat Equipped Jumper = 300 lbs.  PARADROP EQUIPMENT BUNDLE.  These bundles are composed of equipment packed into a canvas container.  The maximum container dimensions are 30" 66" 48".  The bundle is dropped using a static line deployed parachute.  Bundles are rigged in such a manner that when placed on the balance point of the jump platform, the parachute is on the top of the bundle or on the side of the bundle facing the center of the aircraft, based on the largest dimension.  The maximum weight of the bundle is 500 lbs.   MESSAGE PICKUP (MPU) Operation. The MPU sites are selected to meet or exceed all ground and air selection considerations IAW TC 31-24.  The MPU operational procedures and techniques discussed below apply when using a STOL aircraft.  Aircrew shall be able to: Locate the PZ, and be able to identify the PZ, the authentication signals on the PZ, and both far and near recognition signals.  The reception committee must select an MPU that is accessible, secure, and safe.  Air considerations of Terrain: General area shall be relatively free of obstacles, flat or rolling terrain is preferred; however in mountainous terrain use large valleys, flat ridges, and level plateaus, avoid small pockets and valleys surrounded by obstacles such as tall trees and hilly terrain, very difficult for the pilot to locate, approach from any direction is preferred, or a minimum of 45 degrees open quadrant on approach and departure ends, MPU PZ having a single clear line of approach is acceptable provided there is a level turning radius of 2-kilometers/1 nautical mile.  Obstacles:  Terrain obstacles are rising ground or hills more than 153 meters (500 feet) higher than the PZ surface, should not be closer than 6 kilometers (3NM), and must be reported; artificial obstacles 90 meters (300 feet) in height above PZ level not on the issue map within a radius 5 NM must be reported; approach and takeoff clearance is based on the decent and ascent STOL aircraft ratio, or the so-called glide and climb ratio, 1 to 11 ratio, and also is the same ratio for mask clearance on MPU operations.  Size and surface area of the MPU site: MPU pickup zone is the safe area where the aircraft has descended to recovery altitude and is level, cleared to deploy the MPU retriever system, recover the MPU container from the MPU ground apparatus, and the aircraft initiates its ascent. The PZ area is the area where the ground committee places in the visual authentication marking system; the PZ minimum area in length is 92 meters (302 feet) and its minimum width is 23 meters (75 feet).  The PZ surface must be reasonably leveled, obstacle free, vegetation should not exceed 0.3 meters (1 foot).  In addition to the PZ length, mask clearance/ascent/descent ratio (1:11 for STOL aircraft) must be applied to the approach and departure ends in order to clear any obstacle surrounding the usable area.  MPU PZ shoulder safety zone is the area on both sides of the PZ's outer edge, parallel to the PZ's long axis (minimum length 92 meters) and is extended laterally an additional 24 meters (79 feet).  Its surface inside this given area must be clear of obstacles that exceed 1 meter.  The purpose of the two shoulder safety zones is to allow the pilot lateral maneuvers, free of obstacles, to prevent the retrieve anchor point from entanglement during his approach and departure of the MPU operation.  Additional ground consideration information is the surrounding area must be relatively free of obstacles to all a safe flight during approach and departure and to prevent entanglement of the retrieve hook and line.  6.    Aircraft - The Contractor shall provide aircraft in support of this contract that will be maintained IAW FAR 91 subpart E. If this regulation does not apply to the Contractor due to an airworthiness maintenance program under a different regulation or part, USASOC will be notified prior to the execution of any service under this contract.
