<p>Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>The government has identified the following salient characteristics required for the items listed in Schedule B:</p>
<p>(CLIN 0001): The government requires a kit that will allow a 3M Peltor headset to be attached to either side of an existing OPS-Core brand helmet which utilizes the FAST Helmet Rail Connection system (Manufactured by ARC).</p>
<p>(CLIN 0002): The government requires a headset that can attach to the rear section of the FAST Helmet Rail Connection System (Manufactured by ARC). The headsets must be capable of folding back away from the individual's ears and are required to have a small side profile. The headset is required to allow for a full range of adjustments to be made by the wearer (360 degrees) while still attached to the helmet and while being worn by the individual. The headset is required to have ear cushioning that will create a seal around the users ear and head.</p>
<p>(CLIN 0003): The government requires a gun sight mandible that can attach to an existing OPS-Core brand helmet. The mandible is required to provide lower face protection from projectiles and debris (the government is not requiring a ballistic grade armor). The mandible must be low profile so as to not interfere with other equipment attached to the helmet or the individual. The mandible must be removable and have the ability to be folded in half to minimize the chance of the item being broken while being transported and to reduce the space needed to store the item while not in use. The mandible is required to be equipped with a removable front plate so as to allow for increased airflow, drinking and communication while still wearing the mandible attachment.</p>
<p>(CLIN 0004): The government requires an H-Nape style chin strap that has 5 adjustable tabs including one for the nape of the neck to provide additional support and to prevent the helmet from shifting on the user head. The chin strap is required to be adjustable with one hand (while the helmet is being worn). While being worn properly the chin strap shall not have any loose ends or hanging straps so as to not interfere with equipment being worn or the individual's line of sight. The chin strap is required to have padding for comfort, constructed of material that provides durability and allows for ventilation. The chin strap shall be configurable for both left and right eye configurations; this is required so that any obstructions on the strap itself can be moved to the opposite side of a potential sight or camera.</p>

The mount shall allow for vertical adjustments of at least 1.25 inches and horizontal travel of greater than 1 inch.</p>
<p>(CLIN 0007): The government requires a mounting/adapter bracket designed to attach a Contour HD camera to an Ops- Core helmet.</p>
<p>(CLIN 0008 and 0009): The government requires a liner system for Ops-Core brand helmets that is adjustable, and breathable. The liner is required to have padding that is adjustable, modular, removable, and tailorable for each individual. The liner (in conjunction with a helmet) is required to have been tested for impact and ballistic performance by either a government agency or an accredited testing laboratory. The liner is required to utilize Velcro to attach to the helmet.</p>
<p>(CLIN 0012): The government requires a customizable counterweight system that is attachable to the rear of an Ops-Core helmet. The counterweight system shall be between 350 and 400 grams with removable weights in 50 - 70 gram increments. The weight system shall be attachable to the helmet via Velcro and screws. The counterweight system shall further serve as additional storage capable of holding small items such as batteries in a secure pocket.</p>
<p>(CLIN 0013): The government requires a multicam cover for the Ops-Core FAST Ballistic Helmet that utilizes US Army NATIC approved multicam material.</p>
<p>(CLIN 0014): The government requires a non-ballistic helmet system that allows for an assortment of accessories to be attached to the helmet, such as Wilcox NVG Mounts, Headsets, Microphones, Manta Strobes, Tactical Lights, Contour HD cameras, GoPro cameras, as well as other accessories. The helmet is required to be lightweight, compatible with the VAS Shroud and ARC Rail. The helmet is required to be a non-glossy black and adjustable to virtually any head size by adjusting the straps and/or knobs without the use of tools. The non-ballistic helmet shall allow for a customization of fit by allowing multiple padding configuration and thickness to be changed out by the wearer. The helmet system is required to be left or right side configurable by the wearer. The government requires a non-ballistic helmet system that is configured with a customizable counterweight system that is attachable to the rear of the helmet. The counterweight system shall be between 350 and 400 grams with removable weights in 50 - 70 gram increments. The weight system shall be attachable to the helmet via Velcro and screws. The counterweight system shall further serve as additional storage capable of holding small items such as batteries in a secure pocket.</p>
