<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation RFQ5-74235-904 for the purchase of the following: Item 1: ULE Glass Mirror with integral back pads and tooling              balls, 55-CM diameter, 4.5 KG mass, 129-CM nominal radius         of curvature, parabolic figure tested for global accuracy         to 6.3 NM RMS, micro-roughness 1.0 NM nominal,mid-                frequency figure accuracy 2.5 NM or better (Qty. 1) Item 2: Final Report detailing stop-drilling, back-pad attachment,         polishing and testing processes (Qty 1) Item 3: Metrology Data Files  (Qty 1) Item 4: Final mechanical drawings of mirror and back pads (paper          and electronic copies) (Qty 1) Item 5: Nastran Model of Mirror and Back Pad System  (Qty 1) Delivery is required by September 16, 2002. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Eastman Kodak Company under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  The product is a light, ultra-precise glass mirror with an extremely smooth surface suitable for ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet observations from a space platform.  Solar and astrophysical missions in the NASA ROADMAP will require ultra-precise ultraviolet imaging mirrors with an areal density of less than 20 KG/M 2 that can be produced with aperatures larger than 1 - 2 meters.  Glass is currently the only proven technology for meeting the mass and aperture rquirements in conjunction with a global figure accurate to &lt;6 NM RMS and microroughness &lt;1 NM. This procurement is for the final figuring and polishing of a mirror already produced by Eastman Kodak Company.  Eastman Kodak has developed unique and proprietary techniques for the deterministic production of aggressively lightweighted glass mirrors.  Their unique technologies include computer-controlled abrasive water-jet machining of the mirror core, distortionless fusion of mirror core with optical faceplates, and deterministic ion and mechnical polishing to extremely high figures of accuracy.  No other vendor has access to the proprietary processes used by Eastman Kodak Company to produce the mirror.  This product is currenly available only from Eastman Kodak Company.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 9, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The NIEHS intends to negotiate a cost reimbursement, completion type contract with the State University of New York at Stony Brook for a project entitled  "the Barbados Cancer Study".  The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive/genetic study to determine environmental and familial/genetic risk factors for prostate and breast cancer in Barbados, West Indies.  The base contract will consist of a pilot study (Phase I) and an option for two additional years (Phase II).  During Phase I, a one-year pilot, the contractor shall develop the methods, protocols, and procedures for a case-control and family study.  During Phase II, the contractor shall focus primarily on data collection and analysis as they enroll all available incidents of prostate and breast cancer cases, which are estimated to be approximately 800 cases and 1600 controls, and identify families with hereditary forms of prostate and breast cancer.  The desired outcome of this work will be a better understanding of the genetic basis for these diseases.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Competition is not feasible since this study builds on the expertise and database developed by the contractor while carrying out the Barbados Eye Study.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to procure on a sole source basis with Pathway Technologies, Inc., Blue Bell, PA, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Only One Source Reasonably Available, to define industrial case studies in Advanced Intelligent Control and develop a prototype implementation of a Real-time Control System (RCS)-based intelligent controller in a real manufacturing system.  Specifically, Contractor shall explore a problem scenario, define study focus areas, and develop the prototype - all within a detailed report of no less than 40 pages.  The sole source determination is based upon the Contractor's unique combination of (a) experience in implementing advanced controllers for industrial automation and (b) being a developer of tools supporting development of controllers based on the latest versions of RCS-4.  Whereas other firms may have developed tools to support RCS development, these tools are based on earlier versions of RCS, which do not explicitly separate world modeling and sensory processing and are limited to finite state machine execution models. Furthermore, Contractor has demonstrated their expertise in developing aerospace controllers, vehicle control systems, and manufacturing equipment controllers for sensor-rich and non-linear systems.  A firm fixed price Purchase Order will be issued on or about April 26, 2002 with a 12-month performance period.  No RFQ package is available.  Any interested party may submit, in writing, their capability statement to respond to this requirement.  However, a determination by the Government to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

CONTRACT INFORMATION.  A-E services are required for two (2) Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC).  The contract will have a maximum amount of $750,000 for the basic contract with two one-year options, each for a maximum amount of $750,000.  Services wi ll be implemented through negotiated firm fixed price task orders that may be issued up to the maximum contract amount of $750,000.  The basic contract period is one year from the contract award date and each option period extends the contract by additiona l one-year periods.  The option year may be exercised before one year expires if the basic or the first option year contract has been exhausted or nearly exhausted.  The Government is not obligated to exercise the options.  The contract will require the Go vernment to order services priced at not less than two percent (2%) of the stated maximum contract amount for the basic contract, and if exercised, not less than one percent (1%) of the stated maximum contract amount for each of the option years. The contracts are anticipated to be awarded to a qualified firm within six (6) months after selections are made.  THE CONTRACTS WILL BE AWARDED ONLY TO UNITED STATES FIRMS OR TO JOINT VENTURES OF UNITED STATES AND HOST NATION FIRMS.  To be eligible for con tract award, United States firms must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov/ or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.  The Governm ent can issue a Letter of Identification to the successful firm, if a United States firm, upon their request after contract award.   Two contracts will be awarded for the same services.  In addition, two or more existing contracts for the same services already exist.  Each contractor will be afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order in excess of $2,500.  The Contr acting Officer will consider the following factors when awarding a task order:  specialized experience, performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDCs, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, equitable distribution o f work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.   The Government can issue a Letter of Identification to the successful firm upon their request after contract award, which entitles A-E personnel to enter into Japan to perform work on task orders issued under the contract.  The furnishing of any logistical  support (e.g. on-base lodging, Base Exchange, or commissary privileges, etc.) is contingent upon the existing policy of the applicable service commander and upon the best interests of the Government.  The details of the authorized privileges will be deter mined for each individual task order. 2.  PROJECT INFORMATION.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis,  with James R. Mitchell Jr., 9971 Good Luck Road, #104, Seabrook, MD 20706, to provide technical cardiology services to analyze ambulatory Holter monitor tapes for arrhythmia patient care and research studies.   Through competitive procedures Mr. Mitchell was issued a purchase order to provide on site reading holters and discuss ambulatory EKG monitoring findings with clinical investigators and consult Physicians.   Mr. Mitchell has successfully performed this service with a high degree of efficiency and excellence, and he has gained and in-depth knowledge of the Cardiac arrhythmia studies.  Shifting interpretations of the  ambulatory monitor recording readings in the middle of the research project, could compromise the validity of data, possible leading to erroneous diagnoses and determination of the appropriate course of treatment.  In order to maintain continuity of the methods used on reading and analyzing the ambulatory Holter monitor tapes, an award to any other source for this follow-on contract would result in a substantial duplications of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  BACKGROUND: The Clinical Cardiology Section of the Cardiovascular Branch/NHLBI, performs ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring using specialized recording devices (Holter monitor) for clinical research and patient care purposes.  These recordings are necessary to determine causes of symptoms (episodic lightheadedness, loss of consciousness), to assess pacemaker function, and to determine risk of sudden death in patients with heart disease.   PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: The work will be performed at the Clinical Center of the NIH Government Building #10 , 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: It is estimated that this service will be completed by October 30, 2002. 
 This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.    The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541690, Size Standard $5.0 Million is applicable to this requirement.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

SCOPE - This Statement of Work (SOW) provides contractor information necessary to prepare bids for  transport of two 12 meter discus buoys and all associated equipment from Stennis Space Center (SSC) Lat 30 degrees  21 minutes 00 seconds North,  87 degrees  37 minutes 00 seconds West to deployment sites at Lat 26  egrees 06 minutes 00 seconds North - Long 87 degrees  33 minutes 00 seconds West and Lat 26 degrees 15 minutes 00 seconds North - Long 89  00 minutes 00 seconds West. (These are the current coordinates but the coordinates may be revised slightly prior to deployment.)  The contractor shall submit quotes on two options:  Option #1 is to load the vessel at SSC, tow and deploy the buoys, and return to SSC to unload NDBC equipment and personnel.  Option #2 is to load at SSC and return to a port chosen by the contractor with facilities to off load NDBC equipment and personnel.

GENERAL - The buoys are large discus shaped buoys, 12 meters in diameter and each weigh approx. 200,000 lbs.  The mooring are an inverse catenary moorings designed for a water depth of approximately 10,000 feet.  Deployment is tentatively scheduled to commence on July 5, 2002 and shall conclude with return to the designated port.  The vessel will load NDBC support equipment and personnel at the SSC dock and tow the 12 meter buoys down the East Pearl River, to the deployment sites.  Once on site the ship shall deploy the buoys and their mooring components.  After each deployment the vessel is required to remain on station for system testing.  There are maximum sea states in which the vessel is expected to operate. The decision whether to go or no-go when considering weather conditions shall be made by mutual agreement between the NDBC representative and the boat Captain, with the Captain having the final authority to postpone, cancel, or delay a mission.  Due consideration will be given to the safety of the vessel and personnel aboard at all times. A no-go decision because of weather will not be considered cancellation of the contract. 

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS - The vendor shall provide the following capabilities: Captain shall be licensed for offshore transportation to the location specified 300 nautical miles offshore.  The vessel shall meet all United States Coast Guard requirements for 300 nautical miles (min.) offshore certification and shall be capable of the following:  Towing two 12-meter discus buoys weighing approximately 100 tons each, when ballasted for sea towing, at a minimum speed of 5 knots in a Beaufort Force Sea State 3.  Shall be able to transit the East Pearl River, the Rigoletes, and the SSC canal - controlled depth of 7 feet.

<DESC>GSA is announcing its intent to issue procurements under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The General Services Administration (GSA) contracts for local telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers on behalf of various Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within Region 5, The Great Lakes Region, comprised of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Telecommunications requirements are generally satisfied through existing competitive contract vehicles; however, requirements are received by the local GSA Network Services Division field offices that are not able to be satisfied through these vehicles.  Requirements processed by GSA outside of existing contract vehicles normally include commercially available telecommunications services such as: Centrex service and features, business lines and dial tone services, local area access, and Intra-LATA point-to-point services and related inside wire installation and maintenance.  There may be an occasion for miscellaneous switched services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, or Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services may range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  GSA attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  GSA utilizes the Telecommunications Ordering and Pricing System (TOPS), to order local telephone services, track the order activity, and validate the invoice for services rendered.  Services are ordered and provisioned on a month to month basis.  GSA invites companies to identify service availability, by location, including provisioning intervals and point of contact, within the six state region identified.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a specific award as required to satisfy unique needs.  The GSA, Region 5, Federal Technology Service, 5TR, intends to satisfy these individual service requirements from the cognizant local service provider unless a response is received from this notice to identify other sources capable of providing competitive services equal to or less than the prevailing tariff rates.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications service requirements is 513310. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; identification of services, availability and pricing are being requested and individual written solicitations will not be issued.  This solicitation is a Request for Quotation, reference Number 5TS5702R004.  This RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2001-04.  The Desired Delivery Date and Required Delivery Date will be specified on orders identifying specific requirement.  FAR 52.252-2 applies to this acquisition.  Full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this address:  http://www.arnet.gov/far.  FAR 52.212-1 applies to this acquisition.  FAR 52.212-2 shall apply to this acquisition.  Award shall be made, based on cost, to the responsive and responsible offeror.  QUOTATIONS SHALL INCLUDE A COMPLETED COPY OF THE PROVISIONS AT FAR 52.212-3.  FAR 52.212-4 applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) intends to make a single contract award to a responsible entity for the provision of inpatient hospital facility services and various physician services (out-patient and in-patient) for the Federal Prison Camp located at Yankton, South Dakota (hereinafter referred to as FPC Yankton).  The provision of hospital in-patient services shall be accomplished using facilities within a 10-mile radius of FPC Yankton.  FPC Yankton is located at 1016 Douglas Avenue, Yankton, South Dakota, 57078. Officially designated as a LOW/MINIMUM CUSTODY LEVEL institution, FPC Yankton has an inmate-population of approximately six-hundred convicted felons of diverse nationalities. FPC Yankton is an all-male institution with primarily healthy inmates.

When medical needs arise which cannot be provided internally by FPC Yankton?s medical staff and ambulatory clinic, referrals are made to community-based providers. It is the goal of this solicitation to award a contract that will provide necessary hospital facility services for both inpatient admissions and outpatient services. Additionally, the contract requires various physician services to be performed on-site at FPC Yankton and at local clinics and or offices. The following physician/specialities are required on-site at FPC Yankton: Oncologist, Gastroenterologist, Nephrologist, and Neurologist (two, six-hour visits per year); Opthmalogist, Dermatologist, ENT, Urologist, Cardiologist, and Orthopedist (five, six-hour visits per year); Psychiatry (eight hours per month); Physician services (sixty-four hours per month), and Anesthesiologist (twenty, six-hour visits per year). Additionally, the following services are also required on-site at FPC Yankton: Laboratory Technician (thirty-six hours per month); X-Ray Technician (eight hours per month); Dietician (five hours per month); Pharmacy services will also be required; and can either be on-site, or off-site (eighty hours per month). The above-listed services will also be acquired under this contract at local clinics/facilities.

FPC Yankton estimates the following, based on past requirements. The on-site out-patient physician and other services described above are annually estimated at $150,936.00; or $754,680 for the total contract of five years. FPC Yankton estimates hospital in-patient days at seven per year, valued at $14,000 per year, or $70,000 for the total contract of five years. Out-patient clinic visits are estimated at forty per year, valued at $6,000 per year, or $30,000 for the total contract of five years. Therefore, as above-described, the annual estimated value of this contract is $170,936, or $854,680 for the total contract of five years. 

This contract will consist of one base year, plus four option years. The Government retains unilateral right to exercise its option to renew each option period of one contract year. As such, there is no guarantee that the contract will continue beyond each one year period.  Additionally, the quantities and values are estimates and are not guaranteed. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 622110. This NAICS code size standard is $25.0 million in annual revenue.

The BOP intends to award an Indefinite-Delivery, Requirements-type contract with a 12 month base period and four, twelve-month option periods. Delivery orders will obligate funds for the contract, hence there is no guaranteed minimum or maximum quantities, or dollar values. However, all purchase requirements furnished under this contract will be with the awardee, for the periods specified.

Federal penal institution, security requirements apply to this contract. This action is advertised as full and open competition. Solicitation proposal due date will be established based on actual solicitation issuance date. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation (as required under the solicitation) which shall be considered by the agency. 

The solicitation will be available on or after 01/02/2002, and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration?s Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

<DESC>This requirement is amended to provide additional information.
The Internal Revenue Service intends to negotiate on sole source basis with Charles D. Fowler, consultant/instructor for the Fall 2002 Executive Development Class, under simplified acquisition procedures. This is 100% set aside for small business. The role of lead instructor demands unique qualifications due to the continuous interaction with executive candidates.  While the topic may be pre-defined for the lead instructor, the executive candidates will present the lead instructor with a broad, unscripted set of challenges related to the topic.  These challenges come in the form of questions and experienced-based IRS situational discussions that the lead instructor must address.  The vast majority of these interactions are contemporaneous and require that the lead instructor draw from a wealth of Treasury and/or IRS based perspectives found at the senior executive level.  Lead instructors for executive development represent the very best of the IRS executive cadre.  They have interfaced on a continuous basis with Commissioner-level decision making and policy setting; and possess a base of experience that we believe can only be cultivated within the IRS senior executive cadre. All responsible sources that can provide the above requirement must demonstrate their capabilities in writing no later than 7 days after the published date of this amended announcement.  No written solicitations will be issued for this requirement; therefore such request for solicitations will be considered non-responsive. Offerors may submit capabilities by facsimile or mail. Responses over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by fax.  All questions must be submitted in writing and received by facsimile to Adrienne Spruill, Contract Specialist, 202/283-1511, mail, or email adrienne.m.spruill@irs.gov. See Numbered Note 1

<DESC>The U.S. Special Operations Command is seeking sources that currently produce Third Generation, light weight, forward looking infrared (FLIR) imaging systems for navigation, detection, classification, identification, and designation of threats at stand-off ranges, surveillance, and targeting applications. This is not a request for a proposal.
It is the intent of this office to issue a competitive solicitation for the development and procurement of three types of FLIR systems. The proposed solicitation will be restricted to domestic sources only in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Accordingly, foreign sources including Canadian are not eligible for award.  Anticipated award date is Feb 03.
The first system is for approximately 50 light assault FLIR?s. The prototype would be expected 5 months after contract award, with first production units delivered 10 months after contract award.
The second system is for approximately 100 larger, more capable, assault FLIR?s. The prototype would be expected 8 months after contract award, with first production units delivered 14 months after contract award.
The third is for approximately 20 attack FLIR?s. The prototype would be expected 10 months after contract award, with first production units delivered 18 months after contract award.
This office desires that the attack FLIR be nearly identical with the large assault FLIR with the exception of a targeting laser. Therefore, either one or two contracts will be awarded: all three FLIR?s on the same contract, or the small assault FLIR on one and the large assault and attack FLIR?s on the second. 
Desired capabilities on all three FLIR systems include Mid-wave or dual color staring array and Image Intensification (I2), with minimum three fields of view or continuous zoom (1x to 23x light assault and 1x to 50x for attack and assault). All FLIR systems should be MIL-STD-1553 bus and Ethernet compatible (light assault must have a growth path to Ethernet), compatible with existing and planned aircraft displays and avionics, built-in test capable, possess high reliability (600 hours MTBF), and have analog and digital video format. They should have a light total system weight (<40 lbs light assault and < 150lbs attack and assault), and no more than 15.5? high for light assault, and 16.5? high for attack and assault. Additionally, the assault and attack FLIR systems should include FLIR and I2 image fusion, laser rangefinder/designator, with a potential for a Narrow Field of View (NFOV) Charge Coupled Device (CCD) Camera. The light assault system requires 2ea folding flat panel AMLCD?s for display of the FLIR image, with the option for a laser illuminator or pointer.
All FLIR systems must meet military standard testing requirements as outlined in MIL-STD 461, as modified by ADS-37A, and MIL-STD 810.
Interested sources should submit written correspondence to the following address:
United States Army Special Operations Command
Technology Applications Contracting Office
Building 401, Lee Blvd
Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577
Attn: Teresa Dansberry

1) Product brochures and or technical data describing existing or representative systems which meet or exceed the listed requirements.
2) Current production/development status of FLIR systems identified by your company in ?1)? above.
3) A listing of current users operating with the identified system and point of contact information.
4) Current status of your facilities security clearance: SECRET or higher required. Provide CAGE code for verification
5) A statement as to whether or not your firm would be willing to demonstrate the capabilities of your FLIR to Government personnel for evaluation. This is not as a loan, but at your facility.
Please respond by 01 May 2002.  For more information contract Teresa Dansberry, Phone (757) 878-5223, X243, or email at tdansberry@tapo.eustis.army.mil.

<DESC>The due date for proposals has been clarified as January 31, 2002. The original solicitation, including its cover letter, dated December 13, 2001 indicated a proposal due date of January 31, 2002. However, the synopsis on this website indicated a due date of February 1, 2002. The minutes, which will be issued as an amendment, will also indicate a due date of January 31, 2001. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) intends to make a single contract award to a responsible entity for the provision of inpatient hospital facility services and various physician services (out-patient and in-patient) for the Federal Prison Camp located at Yankton, South Dakota (hereinafter referred to as FPC Yankton).  The provision of hospital in-patient services shall be accomplished using facilities within a 10-mile radius of FPC Yankton.  FPC Yankton is located at 1016 Douglas Avenue, Yankton, South Dakota, 57078. Officially designated as a LOW/MINIMUM CUSTODY LEVEL institution, FPC Yankton has an inmate-population of approximately six-hundred convicted felons of diverse nationalities. FPC Yankton is an all-male institution with primarily healthy inmates.

When medical needs arise which cannot be provided internally by FPC Yankton?s medical staff and ambulatory clinic, referrals are made to community-based providers. It is the goal of this solicitation to award a contract that will provide necessary hospital facility services for both inpatient admissions and outpatient services. Additionally, the contract requires various physician services to be performed on-site at FPC Yankton and at local clinics and or offices. The following physician/specialities are required on-site at FPC Yankton: Oncologist, Gastroenterologist, Nephrologist, and Neurologist (two, six-hour visits per year); Opthmalogist, Dermatologist, ENT, Urologist, Cardiologist, and Orthopedist (five, six-hour visits per year); Psychiatry (eight hours per month); Physician services (sixty-four hours per month), and Anesthesiologist (twenty, six-hour visits per year). Additionally, the following services are also required on-site at FPC Yankton: Laboratory Technician (thirty-six hours per month); X-Ray Technician (eight hours per month); Dietician (five hours per month); Pharmacy services will also be required; and can either be on-site, or off-site (eighty hours per month). The above-listed services will also be acquired under this contract at local clinics/facilities.

FPC Yankton estimates the following, based on past requirements. The on-site out-patient physician and other services described above are annually estimated at $150,936.00; or $754,680 for the total contract of five years. FPC Yankton estimates hospital in-patient days at seven per year, valued at $14,000 per year, or $70,000 for the total contract of five years. Out-patient clinic visits are estimated at forty per year, valued at $6,000 per year, or $30,000 for the total contract of five years. Therefore, as above-described, the annual estimated value of this contract is $170,936, or $854,680 for the total contract of five years. 

This contract will consist of one base year, plus four option years. The Government retains unilateral right to exercise its option to renew each option period of one contract year. As such, there is no guarantee that the contract will continue beyond each one year period.  Additionally, the quantities and values are estimates and are not guaranteed.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  This is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MULTIPLE AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT (MACC) AT CHINA LAKE, CALIFORNIA.  The procurement method for this solicitation is best value, trade-off source selection.  There are three major evaluation factors ? Past Performance, Technical/Management, and Price.  The Technical/Management factor is further broken down to include: 1) recent specialized experience; 2) seed project technical approach, and 3) capacity to accomplish the work. These evaluation criteria were chosen to insure that the selected contractor has a satisfactory past performance record; has experience in coordination and management of concurrent multiple projects; has qualified technical and management personnel to perform related tasks; and has necessary capabilities and capacities to perform.  The price proposal will be evaluated to determine the reasonableness of the offerors proposal on the seed project.  This procurement solicitation shall result in the award of three or more (not to exceed five) IDIQ construction contracts.  These contracts are set aside and shall be competed amongst 8(a) certified, or bonafide branch offices in the Fresno, Sana Ana and the Los Angeles Districts.  The scope of work for these contracts will primarily be construction, roofing, demolition, routine renovation and repair of facilities and infrastructure including: 1) aviation and aircraft facilities; 2) personnel housing facilities; 3) administrative facilities; 4) warehouses and supply facilities; 5) medical and dental facilities; 6) abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including, but not limited to, asbestos, lead paint and PCBs); and 7) the civil, sanitary, storm-water, mechanical, and electrical systems.  The seed project, to construct a concrete masonry unit and metal roof building, a new hypochlorite generating system, and provide electrical power from Well #25A to the new building, all in accordance with plans and specifications provided in the solicitation.  Additional Bid Item I is to construct a chain link fence system around the new building. Project awarded under the IDIQ contracts will use the Task Order Concept (TOC) approach to scooping and pricing of the work.  The TOC is a process consisting of on-site walk-throughs with the IDIQ contractors and appropriate government personnel to jointly assess and determine the statement of work(?to-do? list), thereby developing a performance specification for the work.  After award of the initial contracts, the successful contractors will compete for task orders based on either best value using the trade off process, lump sum competition, or best value/low price technically acceptable to the government.  The task order will be written based on a Government/Contractor Team cooperative scoping of the work.  Each contract will be for one base year with two option periods. The total 3 year (base year and 2 option periods) estimated construction costs for the total of all of the awarded IDIQ contacts is NTE $30,000,000.  Construction schedules will be determined for each project at the issuance of each task order.  The anticipated construction cost for each task order is between $100,000 and $1,000.000.  This range is for information purposes only and may vary.  The tentative issue date is on or about 3 May 2002 with the proposal due date approximately 30 days later, but no later than, 4 June 2002.  The NAICS Code is 233310 and 233320.  The related small business standard is 28.5 million.  The cost range for the seed project, to construct a concrete masonry unit and metal roof building, a new hypochlorite generating system and provide electrical power from Well #25 to the new building, is between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.  Plans and Specifications will not be provided in a paper hard copy format.  A job walk/pre-proposal conference will be held at China Lake on 15 May 2002.  Administration of the contract will be via paperless transmissions.  Notification of any changes to this solicitation (amendments) shall be made only on the Internet at the above WEB address.  No monetary deposit is required for this solicitation.  This is NOT a public bid opening.  This project is restricted to 8(a) business concerns as indicated above.  See solicitation for proper address for delivery of proposals.  Proposals will be considered from all eligible, responsible, Central Contractor Registration (CCR) registered sources from the Fresno, Santa Ana, and Los Angeles Districts.  No bid results will be posted.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is conducting a search for interested best provider(s) capable of providing a computer-based tool to conduct patent registration examinations, perhaps online.  This computer-based tool may or may not be installed on current USPTO infrastructure.  It will replace registration examinations currently using test booklets and mark sense forms.  This computer-based tool will accommodate current and future multiple choice examinations designed by the USPTO and/or current and future patent registration examinations.  The purpose of this market research effort is to identify  potential providers, determine industry capabilities, and to solicit comments in order to validate that the technical requirements specified herein represent state-of-the-art technology.  The USPTO also seeks suggestions for improving the delivery of the examination by this computer-based tool.  This market research shall be conducted at no cost to the Government, and firms submitting information will not be reimbursed for costs incurred to develop a response.  The USPTO's acquisition strategy for awarding a future contract for this requirement has not yet been determined and funds have not been committed.   The responses received to this Request for Information (RFI) will enable the USPTO to make informed decisions on future requirements which is why market research information is so critical and your assistance is needed during this acquisition planning stage. (See RFI document for more information).

<DESC>The U.S. Special Operations Command is seeking sources that currently produce Third Generation, light weight, forward looking infrared (FLIR) imaging systems for navigation, detection, classification, identification, and designation of threats at stand-off ranges, surveillance, and targeting applications. This is not a request for a proposal.
It is the intent of this office to issue a competitive solicitation for the development and procurement of three types of FLIR systems. The proposed solicitation will be restricted to domestic sources only in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Accordingly, foreign sources including Canadian are not eligible for award.  Anticipated award date is Feb 03.
The first system is for approximately 50 light assault FLIR?s. The prototype would be expected 5 months after contract award, with first production units delivered 10 months after contract award.
The second system is for approximately 100 larger, more capable, assault FLIR?s. The prototype would be expected 8 months after contract award, with first production units delivered 14 months after contract award.
The third is for approximately 20 attack FLIR?s. The prototype would be expected 10 months after contract award, with first production units delivered 18 months after contract award.
This office desires that the attack FLIR be nearly identical with the large assault FLIR with the exception of a targeting laser. Therefore, either one or two contracts will be awarded: all three FLIR?s on the same contract, or the small assault FLIR on one and the large assault and attack FLIR?s on the second. 
Desired capabilities on all three FLIR systems include Mid-wave or dual color staring array and Image Intensification (I2), with minimum three fields of view or continuous zoom (1x to 23x light assault and 1x to 50x for attack and assault). All FLIR systems should be MIL-STD-1553 bus and Ethernet compatible (light assault must have a growth path to Ethernet), compatible with existing and planned aircraft displays and avionics, built-in test capable, possess high reliability (600 hours MTBF), and have analog and digital video format. They should have a light total system weight (<40 lbs light assault and < 150lbs attack and assault), and no more than 15.5? high for light assault, and 16.5? high for attack and assault. Additionally, the assault and attack FLIR systems should include FLIR and I2 image fusion, laser rangefinder/designator, with a potential for a Narrow Field of View (NFOV) Charge Coupled Device (CCD) Camera. The light assault system requires 2ea folding flat panel AMLCD?s for display of the FLIR image, with the option for a laser illuminator or pointer.
All FLIR systems must meet military standard testing requirements as outlined in MIL-STD 461, as modified by ADS-37A, and MIL-STD 810.
Interested sources should submit written correspondence to the following address:

On Oct 22, 2001 the NTE amount was increased by $135 Million to $184.9 Million by ASN RDA, in accordance with 6.302-2. The basis for restricting competition was the proprietary information of Raytheon and the duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement.  This synopsis is issued to adverti se requirements that will be met through orders placed under the BOA for a six-month period.
