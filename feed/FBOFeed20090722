<DESC><p>The United States Air Force Space and Missile System Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), is contemplating issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to United Launch Services, L.L.C. for Launch Services in support of mission L-38. Only one (1) new mission will be added to the existing EELV Launch Services (ELS) contract with United Launch Services, L.L.C. This Launch Service for Mission L-38 will include requirements for the following: Core Vehicle and Upper Stage, Payload Fairing, Payload Adaptor, Mission Unique Hardware, Mission Assurance Instrumentation, and Booster Storage Costs (if required). The RFP will be issued 15 days after publication of this Notice of Contract Action (NOCA). The Government may elect not to award any launch service (described above) as a result of this solicitation.
<p>FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i) states, "Full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing supplies or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization." A J&amp;A may permit Government missions to be awarded with less than full and open competition to United Launch Services, L.L.C. subject to the Competition in Contracting Act.</p>
<p>The Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW) has developed a New Entrant Evaluation Plan (NEEP). The NEEP defines a structured approach for the Wing to evaluate potential new entrants to perform Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) launch services. A "new entrant" is any contractor other than current providers of EELV launch services. The evaluation plan identifies the business and technical requirements for a new entrant to be eligible for award of launch services. A business evaluation will determine the responsibility of the new entrant, including financial resources, organization and functional expertise, adequacy of production and launch operations facilities, and the ability to obtain necessary construction and environmental permits. A technical evaluation will determine the new entrant's understanding of, and ability to meet, EELV systems requirements, design maturity, adequacy of development and qualification activities, manufacturing process quality, and demonstrated system flight worthiness. The result of the new entrant evaluation process will be a formal determination by the Commander, LRSW, submitted to and approved by the Commander, Space and Missile Center, as to the ability of the new entrant to compete for EELV launch services. The intent of this plan is to ensure new entrants are provided a prompt opportunity to demonstrate their abilities (at their own expense), while protecting the Government's need to acquire systems that meet requirements.<br />Any interested parties or new entrants may contact the PCO (address below) about receiving a copy of the NEEP. Responses from Small Businesses are encouraged. NAICS Code is 541712 with 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Any interested parties (or new entrants) must be: (1) U.S. manufacturers as defined in the in the 2005 Buy 3 Request for Proposal; (2) have successfully demonstrated two missions (intermediate or larger) that inserts payloads into their intended orbits; (3) meet the system requirements identified in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD II) as presented in the March 2005 System Performance Requirements Document (SPRD) for Buy 3; and (4) successfully completed the new entrant evaluation criteria (described above), at their own expense. Firms that did not perform under the Low Cost Concept Validation, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, and Initial Launch Services contracts, yet believe they can satisfy technical requirements and solicitation provisions as contractors for the EELV launch services, are encouraged to submit a Statement of Capability and qualification (limited to four (4) pages) addressing the above criteria within seven (7) calendar days of this synopsis to: LRSW/PK, Attn: Richard Ross, 483 North Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Prior EELV experience has shown that the new entrant certification time period may be longer than the acquisition timeline for the mission identified in this NOCA. Therefore, other interested parties are welcome to use this NOCA and the described New Entrant Evaluation Plan to initiate activity towards qualifying their launch system for future EELV launch services. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, nor to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.</p>

<p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER.&nbsp; The Centers for Disease Control, National Institute for Occupational Safety &amp; Health (NIOSH), Alaska Pacific Regional Office, Anchorage, AK hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to the Alaska Marine Safety Education Association (AMSEA) for creation of a safety video: Falls Overboard Survival for Commercial Fishermen.</p>
<p>Commercial fishing is the most dangerous occupation in the United States, with a fatality rate of 142 per 100,000 fishermen in 2006, 36 times higher than the national average for all workers. Falls overboard are a major contributor to commercial fishing fatalities in Alaska and throughout the United States. From 1990 to 2005, there were 71 fatal falls overboard in Alaska, representing 24 percent of the total number of commercial fishing fatalities. During that time period, the number of fatal falls overboard did not show a decreasing trend, which emphasizes the need to target prevention efforts at this type of fishing fatality.</p>
<p>AMSEA has been providing safety training to commercial fishermen in Alaska for nearly 30 years and is the only known organization in Alaska providing safety training.&nbsp; AMSEA has produced many high quality safety videos for the fishing industry.&nbsp; AMSEA has an extensive network of fishermen from which to locate survivors of falls overboard for interviews in the video.&nbsp; AMSEA has access to necessary personnel (professional digital videographer with experience filming in commercial fishing settings) and equipment, including but not limited to camera adaptable to inclement weather, battery capability for an all-day shoot, personal protective equipment) to produce a high quality commercial fishing safety video.&nbsp; Contractor's crew must be available during summer 2010.</p>
<p>This purchase is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to Alaska Marine Safety Education Association under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1).&nbsp; Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.&nbsp; Please forward documentation to Denise Rains, reference 00HCCA1G-2009-73330, CDC PGO, 315 East Montgomery Avenue, Spokane, WA&nbsp; 99207, email <a href="mailto:dgr8@cdc.gov">dgr8@cdc.gov</a> or fax (509)354-8099.&nbsp; All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a Federal contract.&nbsp; The website <a href="http://www.ccr.gov">www.ccr.gov</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 10th Contracting Squadron, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has received a Sole Source justification for the purchase of laundry and dry cleaning service for the freshman cadets for the month of Sept 09.&nbsp; This purchase order to Sno-White Linen and Uniform Rental, 110 S 26th St, Colorado Springs, Colorado, will be written for a period of one month (1 Sept 09 to 30 Sept 09).&nbsp; This procurement is for the acquisition of a sole source commercial service using simplified procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 &amp; 13.</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY/CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR a VAX 4300 Emulation Solution/Plan.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for a solution/plan to create a virtual memory system environment on a Windows or Solaris operating system to emulate the existing VAX environment (see attached Statement of Work).  
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

The main purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of developing and providing the subject solution/plan.  Based on information received, the FAA will determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541519 - Other Related Computer Services with a standard of $25.0M.
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make a set-aside determination the FAA requests the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:        Type of services provided by your firm,         Size and type of services provided by   previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance),         Number of years in business
2.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
A draft of the Statement of Work (SOW) is attached.  Respondents are encouraged to review the PWS and provide comments.

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2009-232-DDC. 

Background Information
The Laboratory of Developmental Biology, (LDB) Congenital heart disease section intends to use NimbleGen Sequence capture microarrays to capture and enrich selected genomic DNA for sequencing analysis for identifying the genetic basis for human congenital heart disease, such as in Ebstein’s anomaly. The NimbleGen microarrays are custom microarrays that can only be processed using specialized equipment and with highly stringent technical training. SeqWright is a NimbleGen authorized service provider that can undertake this processing. SeqWright be applied to enrich human genomic DNA for targeting the analysis of genes that are likely involved in congenital heart disease.

Purpose and Objectives
The purpose and objective of this procurement is to obtain enrichment of genomic DNA using custom microarrays from NimbleGen designed specifically to recover genes that are likely to play a role in human congenital heart disease.  With the recovery of genomic DNA fro the NimbleGen sequence capture array, it will be possible obtain sequence data for mega base quantities of human genomic DNA. 

Contract Requirement
The vendor will use the DNA supplied by the Laboratory of Developmental Biology to chip the microarrays and process them to recover the desired human DNA targeted by the probes on the sequence capture array. The vendor will further amplify the DNA of interest and supply the amplified human DNA ready to be sequenced.  The vendor will use all the standard techniques developed by NimbleGen and will be a NimbleGen authorized service provider.

Government Requirements
Government will provide DNA and NimbleGen sequence capture arrays and will receive the amplified enriched human DNA as specified by the Government agency. We will use the amplified human DNA and carry out sequencing to ascertain the sequence content of the recovered human DNA.

Reporting Requirements
SeqWright will deliver all the material along with qualitative and quantitative data on the samples recovered from the sequence capture array.  Progress report will be provided by the vendor as each step of the sequence capture procedure is completed, so that there will be reasonable notification of the progress of the project.

WR Medical is the sole supplier of Testworks Cardiovagal/Adrenergic Testing Lab including the Nexfin BP Non-invasive Blood Pressure Monitor (BMEYE). The Blood Pressure Monitor (BMEYE) is the only device available that takes continuous blood pressure readings from the finger artery, non-invasive, that interfaces with the WR TestWorks lab and does not require a separate brachial cuff. 
WR Testworks software is the only known available program which allows the integration of beat-to-beat blood pressure acquisition devices, experiation/inspiration devices, Valsaiva device, and chest bellows. Normative data is integrated for automated comparison of each patient tested. The Blood Pressure Monitor (BMEYE) Nexfin System records and analyzes sympathetic and parasympathetic responses to Valsalve maneuvers and respiration. It is the only beat-to-beat monitor that incorporates the appropriate algorithms used in the clinical setting. 
NINDS conducted a market research with three types of blood pressure machines;  Task Force Monitor 3030I (ImmunoBioSys),  Finapres (Finapress Medical Systems), and  BMEYE Nexfin System (W-R Medical Electronics).  It was found that the BMEYE Nexfin System (WR) Medical Electronics is the only device that will provide the most easily adaptable system for clinical use and an accurate blood pressure reading of 120/80 beat to beat per minute.   This information will provide an algorithm for testing and normative values; which are incorporated into the software to ensure reproducible clinical quality studies. Furthermore, the BMEYE Nexfin System is integrated into one autonomic testing system with the Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Testing (QSART) devices that are currently in use in the NINDS lab.

The intent of this BAA is to have a performer develop a single Solid Oxide Fuel Cell TEP design and deliver two identical prototypes for government demonstration.

Work funded under a BAA may include basic research, applied research and some advanced technology development (ATD). With regard to any restrictions on the conduct or outcome of work funded under this BAA, ONR will follow the guidance on and definition of "contracted fundamental research" as provided in the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) Memorandum of 26 June 2008. As defined therein, the definition of "contracted fundamental research", in a DoD contractual context, includes [research performed under] grants and contracts that are (a) funded by Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Budget Activity 1 (Basic Research), whether performed by universities or industry or (b) funded by Budget Activity 2 (Applied Research) and performed on campus at a university or by industry.  ATD is funded through Budget Activity 3.  In conformance with the USD (AT&L) guidance and National Security Decision Directive 189, ONR will place no restriction on the conduct or reporting of unclassified fundamental research, except as otherwise required by statute, regulation or Executive Order. Normally, fundamental research is awarded under grants with universities and under contracts with industry. ATD is normally awarded under contracts and may require restrictions during the conduct of the research and DoD pre-publication review of research results due to subject matter sensitivity. As regards to the present BAA, the Research and Development efforts to be funded will consist of applied research and advanced technology development.  The funds available to support awards are Budget Activities 2 and 3, which cover applied research and advanced technology development.

<DESC>Design Build Project Number 648-326.  This project is located in Vancouver, Washington.  The NAICS Code is 236220 and the size standard is $33.5 million. This project corrects Patient Privacy and Accessibility deficiencies in the 120 Bed NSCU at the Vancouver Campus of the Portland VA Medical Center. The main corrections are to convert the six, 4-bed rooms into 12, 2-bed rooms, add privacy to the existing congregate baths, add showers to existing bedroom toilet rooms, correct the accessibility of the patient bathrooms, and add grab bars on both sides of the toilet (one of which is to be folding). This will require that we expand out under the existing roof line. This will increase the overall square footage by around 1,000 gsf. The project will also replace the existing window with energy efficient ones.  This is being offered as a design build project.  Contractors will submit two separate volumes in response to the solicitation. Volume One will include information about design-build team qualifications, experience, past performance with similar projects and technical.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>Analysis and Findings:  Income Imputation on the Current Population Survey From 1976 to Present
<SOLNBR>OS6576
<RESPDATE>080509
<CONTACT>Nora V Tyson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-5229, Fax 301-443-3238, Email ntyson@psc.gov
<DESC>The Office of  the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Dr. Fritz Scheuren, 1402 Russner Road, Alexandria, VA 22302.

The purpose of this contract is to obtain expert technical advice in analyzing trends in imputation rates on the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1976 to the present.  The project will examine the impact of the more than doubling of missing income data over these 30 plus years.  It will also examine how growing nonresponse (missingness) has affected poverty and other measures obtained from the CPS which is a major data source for Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) research and evaluation studies as well as other Federal agencies and offices. . In conducting these analyses, focus will be on populations of interest to ASPE, such as poor persons, single parents, minorities, etc.  Concerns about possible misclassification of poor/nonpoor which could lead to mistargeting of resources will be addressed.  

Task 1: Development of Analysis and Findings 

The contractor shall prepare a statistical analysis plan describing the types of analysis that can be conducted using this major new body of information and recommend strategies for conducting analysis and constructing summary tabulations. It shall  identify the array of research that can be conducted using this information and the methodological approaches for conducting research. This plan shall be updated as the analysis proceeds to incorporate new information/findings. 

The plan shall also include detailed specifications for conducting two specific analyses: (1) a general overview of trends in CPS imputation and (2) evaluation of the impact of CPS imputation on measures of poverty.   The contractor shall assist in the conduct of any statistical inferences required, emphasizing ways to develop novel graphical summaries of what has been learned. The contractor shall participate in testing the basically descriptive nature of the results for their statistical significance.   This is a challenging undertaking given the hot deck approach being used for the CPS imputations.

The contractor shall participate in the development of PowerPoint presentations and/or sections of technical papers presenting analytical findings which may include a history of the March CPS income supplement, summarizing past literature on imputation and describing growing problems arising from rises in imputation rate trends.  

Task 2: Attend Meetings to Discuss Analysis and Findings

The contractor will participate in monthly meetings with the ASPE project officer and with the Census Bureau for purposes of finalizing the planned analysis and periodically presenting research findings. 

Task 3:  Final Analysis Plan/Technical Papers

The contractor shall prepare a statistical analysis plan as specified in Task I which shall be updated twice during the contract (approximately 15 to 20 pages in length).   

The contractor shall play a lead role in the preparation of two technical papers describing these analyses and their major findings (approximately 10 to 15 pages in length each) as specified in Task 1.   

The contractor shall also play a lead role in developing PowerPoint presentations summarizing the results obtained for the statistical analysis plan and two technical papers. In addition to summarizing the results obtained, these presentations shall provide an assessment of their policy impacts and what remedies might be offered to mitigate them. These presentations should be approximately 15 minutes in length (20 to 25 slides). 

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

For further information, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857 or on 301-443-5229.

The Philadelphia Marine Design Center (MDC) performed a validation survey utilizing other manufacturers with GSA schedules for comparison.  As a result of this search, approximately 48 manufacturers were surveyed, which resulted in most vessel builders not having vessels of similar size or nature in their product line or if they did have a vessel of comparable size, they had the wrong hull type.  A few of the manufacturers showed similar vessels in form and function; however, they were much higher in price.  This notice of intent is NOT a Request for Competitive Proposals.  No contract award will be made on the bases of this notice.  This notice does not constitute a solicitation document and request for such documents will not be considered.  However, all information received within three (3) calendar days after date of publication of this notice will be considered SOLELY for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information received.  The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 336612 with a size standard of 500 employees.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.VA Boston Healthcare System, Radiology Service, West Roxbury, MA 021322.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.Sole Source procurement of : Contractor to provide preliminary interpretations for selected radiologic studies (CT, MRI, and ultrasound) transmitted by VHABHS (or VAMC Bedford, Manchester, and Togus) between the hours of 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. business days, and 6:00 p.m. Fridays to 8:00 a.m. Mondays, including all holidays.  Holiday coverage will be between 6:00 p.m. the day before the holiday to 8:00 a.m. the day following the holiday.  3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value) Transaction # 523-09-4-7928-0050 with an estimated cost of $200,000. Contractor shall provide preliminary interpretations for selected radiologic studies (CT, MRI, and ultrasound) transmitted by VHABHS (or VAMC Togus and Bedford) between the hours of 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. business days, and 6:00 p.m. Fridays to 8:00 a.m. Mondays, including all holidays.  Holiday coverage will be between 6:00 p.m. the day before the holiday to 8:00 a.m. the day following the holiday.  Contractor shall provide telephonic consultative services during the hours of service; consultations will generally be limited to the selection and protocolling of imaging studies, but may include occasional consultations by referring clinicians related to the interpretations provided.Contractor shall access VABHS's PACS images and the requisitions for the examinations, either via the VA's VPN system or another electronic link mutually agreed upon. In the event of a system malfunction, a backup process shall be in place, involving sending of images on CD by taxi cab to the Contractor for preliminary interpretation.Contractor shall fax a preliminary interpretation to the VABHS ordering location and to a VABHS central fax within 60 minutes (30 minutes for images of operative fields and for specifically designated "Critical Tests") of the availability of the image. Interpretations with critical findings will additionally be reported by telephone to the ordering practitioner.Contractor shall provide these diagnostic services within the specified turnaround times for all images transmitted by VABHS except during times of unexpectedly high workload (at least a doubling of the number of images transmitted by VABHS) or severe unanticipated technical or staffing problems.Contractor shall bear the telecommunications cost of communicating the radiology reports and findings back to the VABHS as well as all telecommunications costs relating to transmission of the diagnostic images.Contractor shall enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with VA Boston Healthcare System in order to facilitate HIPAA-compliant exchange of Protected Health Information (PHI), and to assure appropriate information security in compliance with VA policies.Contractor shall be responsible for installing and maintaining any hardware and software needed to receive images at the reading location, and will adhere to applicable federal regulations protecting confidentiality of patient medical data.Subcontractors shall not be used unless approved in advance by VA, and studies and reports shall not be forwarded to third parties. No patient information shall ever be sent outside of the territorial borders of the United States and territories.Contractor shall provide medical services under this agreement by physicians who are board-certified in radiology, duly licensed and in good standing under the laws of a US state or territory. Contractor shall provide radiologists whose practice primarily or exclusively in the subspecialty of emergency radiology.Contractor shall ensure that all of the physicians providing medical services have medical staff appointments and clinical privileges to practice at the VABHS.

Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.38 U.S.C. 8153(a)(3)(A) provides:"If the health-care resource required is a commercial service, the use of medical equipment or space, or research, and is to be acquired from an institution affiliated with the Department in accordance with section 7302 of this title, including medical practice groups and other entities associated with affiliated institutions, blood banks, organ banks, or research centers, the Secretary may make arrangements for acquisition of the resource without regard to any law or regulation (including any Executive order, circular, or other administrative policy) that would otherwise require the use of competitive procedures for acquiring the resource."	48 CFR 873.104(a) provides:"Without regard to FAR Part 6, if the health-care resource required is a commercial service, the use of medical equipment or space, or research, and is to be acquired from an institution affiliated with the Department in accordance with section 7302 of title 38 U.S.C., including medical practice groups and other approved entities associated with affiliated institutions (entities will be approved if determined legally to be associated with affiliated institutions), or from blood banks, organ banks, or research centers, the resource may be acquired on a sole source basis."FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute"	Additionally, VA Directive 1663, Health Care Resources Contracting-Buying, further implements provisions of Public Law 104-262, The Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996.  This law significantly expanded VA's health care resources sharing authority.  The implementing Directive specifically states "Sole-source awards with affiliates must be considered the preferred option whenever education and supervision of graduate medical trainees is required (in the area of services contracted).  The emergency radiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), are faculty members of Harvard Medical School, and will provide educational, academic-quality lectures to VA Radiology and VABHS Radiology housestaff.5.  	Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of 	the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Harvard Medical School facility, is one of the two major academic affiliates for VA Boston Healthcare System.  Teleradiology services are provided through a subsidiary program of BWH, known as NightWatch.   The other major affiliate, Boston Medical Center/Boston University School of Medicine, does not offer after-hours teleradiology.  As an academic affiliate, BWH has several distinct advantages over other teleradiology services:"	There is a long history of close relations between BWH Radiology and VA Boston Radiology."	BWH radiologists are well known to some VA Boston staff and residents (many of the VA residents are from BWH), and thus have existing professional relationships which would facilitate trust and communication of emergency imaging findings."	As faculty at a teaching institution, BWH radiologists provide an added benefit to VA clinical housestaff during consultations for imaging indications, utilization and other information such as need for interventional radiologic services.  "	Although teleradiology services will primarily involve cross-sectional imaging modalities, occasional supervision and backup may be needed for VABHS radiology residents regarding plain film interpretation, as VABHS residents will continue to provide preliminary plain film services."	As experienced faculty members, BWH radiologists will be able to provide academic-quality lectures to VA Radiology and VABHS Radiology housestaff."	A continuing association with BWH provides the potential to develop future research protocols with VA Radiology, Emergency Department and other areas of VABHS6.	Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential 	sources as is practicable, including whether a Federal Business Opportunities notice 	was or 	will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, 	which exception under 5.202 applies.	A sources sought notice was posted in FBO on April 22, 2009 and stated a response 	date of 	May 11, 2009. Seven (7) potential sources responded.  Three (3) large 	businesses, two (2) 	SDVOSB's, one (1) individual physician,  and one (1) vendor whose size status could not be 	determined.  7.		Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government 	will be fair and reasonable.	A price analysis will be made prior to award to determine if the price is fair and reasonable.  	Additionally, price negotiations may be conducted if the CO determines this is necessary.8.	Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.	Market research for this requirement began in April, 2009 with a query of GSA; 107 total 	vendors are under the SIN 621-050, Radiologic Technology, and 63 of these are small 	businesses.  The majority of the vendors listed are primarily involved in supplying 	technicians or physicians to perform radiologic procedures.  In May, 2009 calls to several 	area hospitals were made and none were able to provide after-hours radiologic services for 	outside physicians.  	A search of VetBiz indicated there were numerous SDVOSB and VOSB vendors listed 	under NAICS code 621512.  Due to the emergency nature of after-hours radiology, and the 	need to mitigate transmission failures or other unanticipated technical or equipment failures, 	any successful vendor must be within a 25 mile radius of the West Roxbury.  Only two (2) 	vendors were located in Massachusetts; the SDVOSB 	that responded to the sources sought 	notice and another SDVOSB vendor that did not respond to the notice.  9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs is "to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan."  In order to best accomplish this goal, it is essential to provide medical service with the highest degrees of skill, experience and compassion available.  This is particularly important in the setting of emergency medicine, specifically during those times of the day when the hospital is not fully staffed. Both VA Boston Healthcare System and BWH share the goals of excellence in healthcare, teaching and research. BWH is uniquely qualified to provide nighttime, weekend and holiday teleradiology coverage for VA Boston for a number of reasons.  "	The BWH radiologists are all either Emergency Radiology fellowship-trained, or are BWH Emergency Radiology faculty.  This assures that any radiologist on duty has both experience and expertise in a wide range of emergency pathology, including all pertinent modalities and organ systems, such as body imaging, neuroradiology, musculoskeletal radiology, general radiology and nuclear medicine. The broad range of skills unique to emergency radiologists maximizes safe and expedient radiologic interpretation for those types of pathology occurring during the evening, weekend and holiday hours."	As the closest major teaching facility to VA Boston, a backup plan of using taxicab or automobile transport of imaging media (CD, DVD, etc.) in the case of system failure is easily accomplished; it is not feasible within reasonable time limits with most other teleradiology providers."	In addition to being an academic affiliate (see 5.), BWH has an established, growing, and highly regarded teleradiology program."	Because of the strong emphasis on not only state-of-the-art medical care, but also teaching and research throughout VHA, a close academic affiliate is often in the best position to provide contracted services that address these areas in a comprehensive and integrated way. As described in the VA Radiology Handbook, "services are often procured from a university affiliate on a sole-source basis." "	The BWH physicians have expressed a strong interest in VA peer review and feedback"	BWH Radiology is known for their strong IT support and have the technical expertise to facilitate integration with VA OI&T services."	The large and well-staffed organization at BWH makes the workload easily scalable as needs change. "	The proximity of BWH will facilitate the ease of communication and information transfer.10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.1.	Jackson & Coker Locum Tenens2.	Online Radiology Medical Group Incorporated3.	An Individual Physician4.	Brigham and Women's Hospital5.	PatriotVetIT6.	Heritage Radiology Solutions7.	LocumTenens.com11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.VA policy is to seek competition in the acquisition of healthcare resources and this is done whenever possible.  A review of the VA FY2009 Socioeconomic Program Goals & Accomplishments shows that VISN 1, VA New England Healthcare System, is significantly exceeding the VA-Wide Socioeconomic Goal for Small Business.  The VA-Wide goal is 28.7% and as of April 30, 2009, 56% of contracts had gone to small businesses.

<p><br />The IPG ELR-2-1550-SF is a single frequency, continuous wave 1550nm, 10 watt laser. It has four output fibers and a narrow 20kHz line width. Its main function will be for photonic Doppler velocimeter (PDV) operations where velocity data will be captured up to 10km/s. The very high power is necessary so that the PDV can capture enough reflected light to deduce the velocity in a multipoint configuration. Furthermore, the laser is equipped with a BNC connector for TTL modulation.</p>

<a href="mailto:john.tompkins@gasava.ang.af.mil">USPFO for Georgia</a>
<DESC>1.0	SCOPE:  This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the requirement to install a point to point microwave link between the 165th Airlift Wing located at Savannah IAP, Georgia, the 117th Air Control Squadron located on Hunter Army Airfield, Townsend Bombing Range in McIntosh County, Georgia and the 224th Joint Communications Support Squadron located at Glynco Airport in Brunswick, Georgia. This link will support voice and data capability and serve as a backup to the T-1 circuits currently serving all mentioned units. Data speeds of 100 MB or faster are what the 165th is expecting out of this circuit.<BR><BR>2.0 REQUIREMENTS:<BR><BR>2.1.Vendor Requirements: The vendor shall provide all necessary hardware to include radio equipment, cabling, antennas, connectors, clamps and any other material to install and complete this project. No premium time is authorized, which includes weekends and holidays.<BR><BR>2.1.1 The vendor will provide an itemized list of hardware and software, if necessary by the Product Code (PC) and individual cost to the 165CF/SCX.  The quote, which will consist of all hardware, software, installation, technical reviews, programming, service plans and travel, will be reviewed by 165CF/SCO and the 165CF/SCX for accuracy prior to award.  All equipment used must meet Air Force certification and accreditation standards.<BR><BR>2.1.2 The vendor will be responsible for shipment or delivery and safeguard of associated hardware and software to complete the required installation.  Discrepancies with the hardware and/or software are the responsibility of the vendor until the installation is completed and signed for by the user.  The vendor will submit a signed invoice to 165CF/SCO and 165CF/SCX for review of the completed work.  All associated documentation and instructions will be returned to the 165CF/SCO for safeguard.<BR><BR>2.1.3 The vendor will be required to program and test all radio hardware to verify operational capability and provide test results to include expected data throughput and speed. Once the vendor terminates each leg of this circuit, the 165th SCO technicians will provide Ethernet connectivity to this circuit and configure government owned hardware and fiber to complete the circuit between each unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         <BR><BR>2.1.4 It is expected this equipment will come with a minimum one year warranty provided by the manufacturer. Include a yearly service plan, as an option in the contract, to cover the expense of any repair work-to include the vendor to climb said towers to repair any trouble calls or equipment outages.   Service and repair completion is expected within 48 hours from notification of a problem. The 165th SCO technicians should be able to verify the circuit is not operational but would not be expected to climb heights where the antennas will be located. Access to sites located on government owned towers can be coordinated between the 165th SCO office and the vendor.<BR><BR>2.1.5 The vendor will seek tower sites that do not incur rental or usage fees to the maximum extent as possible to keep this project at a reasonable expense.  If commercial rental tower space is unavoidable, then the 165th requests negotiating monthly fees with tower owners to keep expenses to a minimum. Georgia DOT bridge sites are a possible solution to design this circuit. The 165th SCO office can provide points of contact and coordinate communication between the vendor and the Georgia DOT office in Savannah, Georgia to assist in securing permits for access to those locations.  Vendor must include any tower lease/usage fees, for informational purposes, in the quote.<BR><BR>2.1.6 Backup power generation will be required at each site to keep this circuit operational during emergency contingencies or local telephone company outages. The bid will include pricing to purchase and install back up power to selected sites that do not currently have that capability. As an example, the Savannah bridge downtown (US17A) which is a desirable location to connect the 165th and the 117th ACS at Hunter does not have this capability. A possible solution would be solar panels and batteries at the bridge site to keep this portion of the circuit operational. <BR><BR>2.1.7 The vendor is required to remove all excess debris, (boxes, wrapping paper, bubble wrap, etc) from each installation site and all excess hardware will be returned to the 165CF for disposal.  <BR><BR>2.2 Government Requirements: The 165CF will provide a technical and point of contact an alternate for assistance to support the installation of the new hardware/software and peripheral equipment at each location.<BR><BR>2.2.1 The 165CF will provide the vendor with the operating hours for each location and coordinate any security access requirements with the vendor representative and the local security office.  As required by AFOSH standards, the 165CF will conduct a safety overview for the vendor representative.<BR><BR>2.2.2 The 165CF/SCO will oversee the project installation.  This will include all Quality Assurance (QA), which includes housekeeping requirements and safeguards to ensure all the requested work is completed.  <BR><BR><BR>2.3 User Location(s): <BR>	<BR>	165AW<BR>	1401 Robert B.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Command, PicatinnyArsenal, NJ is interested in determining the state of the art/state of thepractice of readily available (non-developmental) firearms that could serve as a Configurable Extended Range Sniper Rifle (CERSR). The purpose ofconducting this survey as part of a research effort is to identify potential sources of different types of CERSR candidate weapons that will extenda Snipers effective range when engaging personnel targets beyond current 7.62x51mm and .300 Winchester Magnum (Win Mag) based platforms and ammunitionwhile also providing the option of reconfiguring the rifle to fire 7.62x51mm and .300 Win Mag cartridges currently available to US Armed Forces.  Theoverarching objective of this CERSR research effort is to ascertain 1) the viability of a rifle/cartridge materiel combination that will maximize personnel size target probability of hit and ensure lethality at various ranges out a minimum of 1500 meters and 2) if the platform can be configuredto meet  the operational needs of military Snipers (i.e. weight, size, user interface, and caliber flexibility) based on Mission, Enemy, Terrain and weather, Troops available, Time (METT-TC) and Rules Of Engagement (ROE) considerations.  In addition, the government seeks to characterize the effectsof changes on such things as weapon shooter interface design features, weight, barrel length/twist characteristics, cartridge performance, ease of reconfiguration, component alignment repeatability, and overall physical dimensions.  Potential CERSR candidates shall meet the following criteria:
1) Readiness Level:  Design is ready to work in its final form and under expected conditions with exception to minor user induced changes that are primarily user interface related and materiel submissions are immediately available for evaluation.  The manufacturers existing technical datacurrently provides sufficient data to support fabrication of prototype materiel (Developmental Design Drawings) for test and can be ready formanufacture (Product Drawings) within one (1) year of this announcement.(See MIL-DTL-31000C, section 3.6.1 for Developmental and Product drawingdefinitions).
2) Caliber:  Chambered to accommodate a .338 caliber cartridge, however, .338 cartridge configuration is open to any commercially available variant andbullet weight (See FAR 2.101 Commercial item) and also capable of reconfiguration to chamber 7.62x51mm NATO STD ammunition particularly M118LR (DODIC AA11) and .300 Win Mag (DODIC A191) cartridges.
3) Configurability:  It is desired that the serialized receiver be common to all caliber configurations, however, one serialized receiver per caliber isan acceptable solution at this time for this research effort.  The rifle shall be reconfigurable at the Field Maintenance level (combined operatororganizational level (-10) and direct support (-20)) by MOS 45B-Small Arms Repairman after receiving contractor supplied training and special tooling(See AR 750-1 for Army Maintenance Policy).  It is requested that a brief description of any special tooling (and associated cost) be disclosed inresponse to this sources sought announcement if required for rifle reconfiguration.
4) Sound Suppressor:  Configured with one (1) sound suppressor and applicable interface hardware capable of tool less attachment to and removal from7.62x51mm, .300 Win Mag, and .338 caliber rifle barrels.  Sound suppressor shall not shift point of impact by more than two (2) minutes of angle in allcalibers.  Impact shift direction shall be consistent when removing and reattaching the suppressor.
5) Stock/Chassis:  Stock shall accommodate detachable box magazine configurations designed to reliably feed 7.62x51mm, .300 Win Mag, and .338, with an ergonomic adjustable comb, length of pull, and folding butt stock.

6) MIL-STD-1913 Rail:  Shall be configured with a MIL-STD-1913 rail capable of accommodating both a day optic, an in-line, forward mounted detachableclip-on night vision device as well as other rail mounted ancillary target acquisition and aiming devices.
7) Day optic:  Shall be configured with a day optic scope (DOS) and mounting rings.  The DOS will have ample magnification to easily acquire and engagetargets out to a minimum of 1500 meters, be fitted with a rapid ranging stadia reticle, 1/10th milliradian elevation and windage adjustments, and enough reticle travel to accommodate a minimum of 1500 meter engagement given the proposed ammo/weapon and in combination with the platforms1913 rail declination (if any).
This survey will provide insight to the government on the trade-offs associated with integrated CERSR rifle design, reconfiguration advantages, andcartridge configuration. Interested responders should provide a description of their weapon system(s) including technical specifications (e.g. overalllength, barrel length(s) and associated rifling characteristics (i.e. twist rate and direction, type of rifling, number of grooves), loaded/unloadedweight, firing rate) along with any additional information the responder deems necessary to describe the physical characteristics and performance of thesystem.  This is a market survey only.  This is not a request for proposal.  This is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procurethese items, nor does the Army intend to award on the basis of this sources sought or otherwise pay for the information requested.  There is no formalsolicitation available at this time.  All information will be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. government. Any and all information shouldbe mailed to Commander, US Army Contracting Command Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, ATTN: Frank Corradi, Contract Specialist, Building 9,CCJM-SW, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 or email: frank.corradi@us.army.mil

<SUBJECT>Proposed addition of Safety Pins to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled
<SOLNBR>CP-09-07-22
<RESPDATE>080509
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Safety Pins by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>8315-00-787-7000 Safety Pin, 2"<br />8315-00-787-8000 Safety Pin, 1.5"</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA/FAS Southwest Supply Center, Fort Worth, TX<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Safety Pins to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>None Reported</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Safety Pins to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than August 5, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only and is intended to provide notification of the use of funds authorized under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 on this contract. The United States Department of Health and Human Services, Indian Health Service, awarded a fixed price competitive task order under GSA Schedule GS23F8132H to Deloitte & Touche, L.L.P., on March 25, 2009 for Federal Financial Management Support services to assist with compliance with the Federal Manager Financial Integrity Act and OMB Circulars A-123.  The scope of the order includes evaluation, documentation, and testing of management controls.  Subsequent to placement of the order, the Department published additional guidance that supplements OMB Circular A-123 to address the specific accountability and transparency requirements of the Recovery Act.  This action is to fund a modification with Recovery Act funds to evaluate if the work accomplished to date adequately covers the supplementary guidance and to accomplish the necessary work to address any identified deficiencies.  The rationale for using other than a competitive procedure is that the change is within the scope of the existing order and cannot reasonably be accomplished as a separate acquisition.

<CONTACT>Carol R. Dingess, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone 6123363208, Fax 612-336-3550, Email Carol.Dingess@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal Plant Health Inspection Services, Veterinary Services Facility in Ames, IA intends to award a sole source purchase order to Molecular Devices Corp. for a SpectraMax&reg; M2 Multimode Plate Reader. The rationale for this intention to Sole Source can be found in FAR 6.302-1 ( Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. )<br />The SpectraMax M2 is the only microplate reader which has been found to meet all of the following performance specifications needed:
<p>Must be a Dual Monochromator-based system for dual mode (fluorescence &amp; absorbance) reading in cuvette port and in 6- to 384- well microplate.<br />Must read absorbance in standard, commercially-available cuvettes and microcuvettes, 12 x 75 mm test tubes, and 96- or 384-microplates with a built-in cuvette port and a microplate drawer in the reader and performed with a single wavelength selection.<br />Must use a Xenon flash lamp for longer lamp lifetime.<br />Must have Dual Monochromators for tunable fluorescence wavelength selection between 250 nm and 850 nm for excitation wavelengths and 360 nm to 850 nm for emission wavelengths. No wavelength filters are required for purchase when additional assays are added to laboratory.<br />Must have tunable absorbance wavelength selection between 200 nm and 1000 nm. No filters are required for purchase in the future when additional assays are added to laboratory.<br />Must have a 4 nm absorbance bandwidth for superior peak resolution and increased accuracy of measurements for narrow bandwidth samples.<br />Must have fixed fluorescence spectral bandwidth of 9 nm EX/EM for improved resolution between excitation and emission. Narrow bandwidth is critical when designing multi-fluorophore assays or when using narrow Stokes shift fluorophores.<br />Must read up to four EX/EM wavelength pairs per microplate for multi-fluorophore assay design.<br />Must have full wavelength scanning capability across the entire spectral range for defining actual EX and EM maxima. Can perform spectral scans in user-defined increments as small as 1 nm, and then can select assay wavelengths for actual maxima. Increases sensitivity for assay by working at actual conditions rather than using literature references.<br />Must have Automatic PMT setting to adjust the optimum voltage for each well sample concentration and then normalizes the raw data to show RFU values. Wells are selectively reread at the optimal PMT setting. Photo-bleaching is eliminated because wells are not read unnecessarily. <br />Must incorporate the patented PathCheck sensor (U.S. Patent 5,959,738) - the only sensor of its kind not affected by temperature, and requires no accessories to measure the pathlength of the sample in all individual microplate wells. The pathlength measurement can be used to calculate concentrations without a standard curve, test liquid handling devices, detect and correct for pipetting errors, and expand the dynamic range of the assay.<br />Must have the option to run the reader with a slow carriage speed to increase assay precision.<br />Must have the following read times (minutes:seconds):<br />96-well 384-well <br />&bull; Absorbance 0:18 0:49<br />&bull; Fluorescence Intensity 0:15 0:45<br />Must have thermal regulation for temperature dependent kinetic assays. Temperature is regulated up to 45&deg;C. Three heat sources provide uniform temperature regulation across the plate (+/- 0.5&deg;C well-to well @ 37&deg;C). One heat source above the plate creates a small temperature differential eliminating plate lid fogging during kinetic runs.<br />Must offer compliance support tools including: <br />&bull; Software validation package<br />&bull; IQ/OQ/PQ documentation<br />&bull; Physical validation test plates for absorbance and fluorescence<br />Must offer automatic validation of absorbance performance with the SpectraTest<sup>TM</sup> ABS1 validation plate. The SpectraTest ABS1 validation plate provides NIST traceability, and performs 8 tests to easily verify optical performance for GXP compliance.<br />Must offer automatic validation of fluorescence performance with the SpectraTest<sup>TM</sup> FL1 validation plate. The SpectraTest FL1 validation plate performs 12 tests to easily verify optical performance for GXP compliance.<br />Must be robot-compatible for automation without requiring any instrument modification.<br />Must ship with software that provides microplate reader data acquisition and analysis support for both Windows XP and Macintosh OS X operating systems.<br />Software must offer a common file format that allows data files to be edited, saved, and shared by users on both Windows XP and Macintosh OS X, provided on one CD-ROM.<br />Software must ship with many read-to-run protocols for a variety of common assay applications.<br />Software must have ability to design custom assay protocols or customize existing protocol to create meaningful reports, graphs, and multi-plate summaries, including data trend analysis. Also must be able to save protocol as a menu-available choice so that one touch of the Read button will allow completion of data report in final format.<br />Software must allow for the ability to auto save multiple copies of assay data in all desired formats:<br />&bull; SoftMax Pro native<br />&bull; .TXT files<br />&bull; .XML files<br />&bull; .PDF Files (Mac OS X)<br />Software must allow the following data analysis tools:<br />&bull; Simultaneous evaluation of multiple standard curves<br />&bull; Ability to easily graph multiple plots on multiple graph sections<br />&bull; 4- and 5-parameter curve fitting with parallel line analysis<br />&bull; BOOLEAN operators If, And, Or, Not, False, True<br />&bull; Auto-repair of broken formula links<br />Software must support regulatory compliance requirements such as FDA 21CFR part 11, GLP, GMP, etc (collectively referred to as GXP).<br />Software must have control over virtually every aspect of the microplate reader solution to meet these "GXP" regulations. These controls include required user logon, management of guest access, granular permission structure, support for electronic signatures, operation of reader within permissions structure, complete experiment audit trails, network and local AutoSave.</p>

The current capacity for this distribution is not meeting the daily demands, and requires doubling the capability just to get to an adequate level of output. Additional increases in media distribution strategies with the regional broadcast hubs across the globe, as well as media support for regional bureaus and posts requires PA to significantly increase our multimedia and multiformatting capabilities.    PA/OBS needs to expedite the delivery of this content to improve global audience reach and 2nd party placement of DOS video clips.   The timely and widespread delivery of this content is a critical success factor in communicating foreign policy and American values to a global audience.

Please see attached requirement.  Period of Performance:  For CLIN 0001 delivery date of 30 days with a 90-day warranty upon delivery; for CLINS 0002, 0003, and 0005:  30 days; for CLIN 0004:  3-year maintenance on CLIN 0001 items after the expiration of the 90-day warranty.  This is an RFQ as well as a brand-name justification for the "Alteon" brand.  Alteon Components are the only ones that can meet the Infrastructure Portal Engineering Project’s requirement for the IRS DITE/EITE environment.  These products are already approved by the IRS and being used in the current technical environment.  To change the products would be very time consuming and costly to the government.

Offers shall provide a firm fixed price for the system. Technical Specifications include:  1.The system should be used for compositional qualitative and quantitative analysis of various samples, for thermal stability, and oxidative stability. 2.The thermal gravimeteric analyzer can go up to 1100?C in almost any atmosphere with a heating from room temperature to maximum at in less than 10 min. 3. The temperature measurements of the samples should include a thermocouple in direct contact with the sample crucible and have high accuracy: ?0.25 ?C / ? 0.5 ?C (up to 1100 ?C) with a wide linear heating rate. 4. The forced cooling rate for1000? C to 50 ?C will be in less than 15 min. 5.Temperature calibration can be made with either electromagnetic coil or cuie point standards. The TGA should allow that the calibration is independent of heating rate, purge gas and pan type or provide an easy way to correct this without the need to recalibrate the instrument or manually change calibration factor. 6. TGA should include an automatic gas controller that allows for switching and mass flow control of up to four gases. 7. The TGA should have an internal balance with a capacity of up to 1000mg sample although a typical sample size for the analysis will be around 10 milligrams with balance resolves to 1 microgram or 0.1 %. The base line dynamic drift is less than 10 micro gram. 8. System has high sensitivity and allows the analysis of a wide range of polar and non-polar components samples. 9. The evolved gas can be routed to the mass spectrometer for identification. 10. The system can have the option of gas chromatograph for trapping the evolved gas and resolving the mixture before routed to the mass spectrometer though low volume, heated transfer lines to avoid condensation. 11. The Quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) can measure the gas evolved from the thermal decomposition of the sample integer mass unit up to 1000 AMU. The MS will have a very low detection limit, typically picking up materials in the PPB range, with high signal resolution. 12. The sample chamber in the furnace should be tightly sealed to allow full control of the atmosphere to which the sample is exposed. The active part of this chamber will made of fused silica, so that samples can be exposed to many reactive gasses. The system is equipped with an easy selection and precise control the gases. 13.This TGA-MS system is flexible, robust, and very easy to use. The temperature ramp is fully and easily programmable with both dynamic and isothermal base line stability. 14.Both the TGA -MS include hardware / software that allow controlling the system, collection and analysis of data and the transfer of the data in different program formats.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR><BR>The US Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center, in support of the 598th Transportation Terminal Group (TTG), hereby requests submission of business profiles/technical capabilities statements on or before 30 July 2009 for the movement of cargo via ground transportation in the AFRICOM Area of Responsibility (AOR). <BR><BR>Commercial Carriers interest and capability to perform line haul services within the AFRICOM AOR are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is not funded.  It is expected all services rendered under this announcement will be funded by a Transportation Accounting Code (TAC) on a tender basis.<BR><BR>The NAICS code is 484121.  <BR><BR>The intent of this combined synopsis/solicitation is to establish a vendor base for line haul services within the AFRICOM AOR capable of performing services on a tender based system.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Regulation.  The clauses and provisions referenced in this solicitation may be obtained in full text form at http://www.arnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>Scope of Contract:  Contractors must possess the ability to provide line haul service from numerous points of origin to destination within ARFICOM.  Cargo to be moved consists of Freights of All Kind (FAK) and may include both sensitive and hazardous cargo at times.   Due to the fact that service will be required in multiple countries, vendors should have the capability to provide line haul services, clear customs, and possess the necessary entry information for the respective host nations throughout AFRICOM. The estimated number of movements monthly is still being defined. Armed Security is not allowed under these movements. These line haul services will be executed via a tender based system in accordance with the draft Standard Operating Procedure for Spot Bid Support to AFRICOM.<BR><BR>Location of Performance will be throughout the AFRICOM AOR.  At this time services are not restricted to one geographical region. <BR><BR>The 598th TTG intends to execute line haul services in the AFRICOM AOR, in accordance with the draft Standard Operating Procedures on a tender based system.  This process is open to commercial carriers who meet the following requirements, as requested in the form of a business profile/technical capabilities statement.<BR><BR>Interested commercial carriers shall provide a business proposal/technical capabilities statement detailing their  the ability to staff throughout the AFRICOM AOR. Carriers should detail their accountability procedures for providing in-transit visibility of cargo being moved from origin to destination and should provide in detail the tracking methods to be used (i.e. HUMINT, GPS, etc.) and the location/utilization of checkpoints. These procedures should include the method of confirming proof of delivery at final destination and maintaining cargo accountability throughout the transit. Carriers should provide sufficient details on their approach to secure visas for employees crossing borders. Finally, carriers should provide their management approach to move (but not limited to) containerized and break bulk cargo from origin to destination, to include details about transload activities that may be necessary at any intermediate point along the routes. <BR><BR>Interested commercial carriers should address their specifications of the equipment and labor being offered in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation.  In addition, carriers should provide details on the ability to utilize Material Handling Equipment (MHE) and conduct transload of cargo. Details on the maintenance of the trucks as well as the ability to perform emergency maintenance on equipment, as needed, to include a recovery plan should a truck become disabled along the route for any reason; should be included.<BR><BR><BR>Services will be executed within the Global Freight Management (GFM) System and Spot Bid. <BR><BR>     The Global Freight Management (GFM) system is an automated DoD-wide freight traffic management system. SDDC is the single manager of DoD surface freight movements and is responsible for acceptance and approval of tenders of service from the U.S. carrier industry. SDDC developed a standard tender in 1987 and requires all carriers to submit tenders using that standard. This allowed, for the first time, automation of the tenders, carrier rates, and costing equations used by the carriers. SDDC has developed the GFM system as a web-based DoD-wide freight traffic management system with a carrier tender database as an integral part.<BR><BR>     Spot Bid is a flexible and responsive one-touch electronic resource that posts open shipments for bid by qualified carriers via the Internet.

	(1) 0 Are, 0  are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
	(2) 0  Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

	(4) 0  Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
		(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
			(A) The tax liability is finally determined.  The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.  A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.  In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
			(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.  A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.  A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
		(ii) Examples.  (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.  This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
			(B)  The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.  In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.  This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
			(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159.  The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.  The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
			(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.  The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

COMDTINST 4200.14 - Notice for Filing Agency Protests
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>1. What size (in inches) are the columns? 3.13 inches</p>
<p>2. Do you have any shelving layouts or drawings other than the ones supplied? There are no drawings that is why the customer wants you to provide one in your solicitation.</p>
<p>3. Does this allow for walk-ways or will there need to be room left outside of these areas for walk-ways? yes this allows for walk-way</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Using AutoCAD, the drawing can viewed at a 1:1 scale by clicking the model space button on the lower left hand corner. Inside paper space the sheet will state Not to Scale so when the drawing is printed on various page sizes it won't be misinterpreted (i.e. 8.5x11, 11x17, etc).</p>

Participating measurement systems are required to provide facility-specific and comparison group performance data to Joint Commission for use in their accreditation process, and to provide feedback reports to its clients in the form of comparison graphs and control charts. On July 21, 1997, the Office of Quality and Performance was notified that VHA's performance measurement system had been accepted for inclusion on Joint Commission's list of acceptable systems, and its official title is Veterans Performance Measurement System (VPMS). In January 1998, VHA's National Leadership Board agreed that all VHA facilities would utilize the VPMS as their identified ORYX measurement system. The VPMS meets all ORYX requirements for acute care (hospital), behavioral health care and home care, and is committed to meeting all future Joint Commission criteria for these programs. The intent of VHA submitting its own measurement system for consideration was to promote the concept of one performance measurement system; to ensure the ORYX requirements were transparent, to the extent possible, to VHA's own performance measures; and to avoid duplicate systems and data collection requirements. Joint Commission implemented hospital core measures on July 1, 2002 with the introduction of four initial core measure sets. Currently, VPMS is collecting and transmitting hospital data on Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Heart Failure (HF), and Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). However, some hospitals use a combination of both core and non-core hospital measures. In 2004, the VPMS will embed the most recent core measure set for Surgical Infection Prevention, but currently has no plans to collect or transmit data to Joint Commission. At the present time, there are no ORYX requirements for ambulatory care-accredited facilities. Joint Commission depicts an accredited hospital's core measure performance as compared to other Joint Commission-accredited hospitals, both nationally and by state, in its new Quality Report. Joint Commission posted the first Quality Reports in July of 2004 which included 2003 core measure results. As quarterly ORYX core measure data are submitted and analyzed, Joint Commission "refreshes" ORYX core measure information for all accredited hospital Quality Reports (as applicable). In addition, the Office of Quality and Performance provides an analysis of VAMC results, as well as a national and VISN summary. Also included is a public relations package to assist facilities in responding to any questions or inquiries from the public. This information is updated quarterly to coincide with the Joint Commission's Quality Report update. At the present time, there are no ORYX requirements for ambulatory care-accredited facilities. For long-term care ORYX requirements, VHA has a waiver to use RAI-MDS data internally until Joint Commission develops and implements core measures for long-term care.1.

<p>______________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (16 JUNE 2009)</p>
<p>Question 1:&nbsp; What is the specified quantity for the printers?</p>
<p>Answer 1:&nbsp; Attachment "Solicitation Clauses" states that the quantity for printers required is 13.</p>
<p>Question 2:&nbsp; There is a Xerox printer with slightly different specifications.&nbsp; Is this an acceptable alternate to HP?</p>
<p>Answer 2:&nbsp; Although this type of printer is Energy Star Certified, it does not meet our requirement and does not provide us the support we will need.&nbsp; There cannot be a slight difference in our specifications due to security requirements.</p>
<p>Question 3:&nbsp; I am not able to see the Interested Vendors List on the FBO website.&nbsp; Does this mean that I am not eligible to bid for this requirement?</p>
<p>Answer 3:&nbsp; No, you may still bid.&nbsp; We turned off the option to be able to see all of the vendors that were or were not bidding.</p>
<p>Question 4:&nbsp; Are we supposed to be part of the setup process of these printers or would the department take care of the setup of these printers in the network?</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide questions and anwser to clarify concerns from interested vendors

Question for Item No. 0001:  You have listed 8 analog stations and 8 trunk ports, but in the item listing there is a line item for 8 trunk ports without an item for the 8 analog station ports.  Could you clarify the number of analog station and trunk ports required? 

NIST Response: 8 analog and 8 trunk ports

Question for Item No. 0008:  Do you have a preference for brand name?

NIST Response:  No preferences.

Question for Item # 8, Server for Voice Mail Applications:
The specification provided calls for a ‘Lightscr+ibe’ device for the server; our experience is that a lightscribe device will consume significant processor power and will degrade the performance of the Voice Mail application which is a real time application. Please clarify the usage of the lightscribe device or remove from spec.

NIST Response: It is a DVDRW with software.

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a need for a multiuse, high-resolution, x-ray diffraction system. The system must be capable of thin film diffraction, reflectivity, grazing incidence diffraction (GID), transmission and reflection small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), pole figures, texture analysis, reciprocal space mapping, and in-plane diffraction. The system must also be able to easily change between focused optics and a collimated beam with slits to accommodate grazing incidence. It is highly desired that the system has self- or auto-aligning capability. The system must be modular to allow ease of changing optical configurations needed for different measurement techniques.<br />General Capabilities Overview<br />1. The x-ray diffraction (XRD)system must be capable and include all of the components to perform and analyze all of the following measurements: conventional thin film &theta;/2 &theta; measurements, bulk and/or powder &theta;/2 &theta; measurements, thin film high-resolution x-ray diffraction (HR-XRD), X-ray reflectivity (XRR), grazing incidence diffraction (GID) with both in-plane and out-of-plane measurements, pole figures, texture analysis, rocking curves, reciprocal space maps, in-plane diffraction, and small angle x-ray scatting (SAXS) in both reflection and transmission. Typical samples include: polycrystalline and epitaxial metallic and ceramic films and multilayers which range in thickness from 2 nm to 150 nm deposited on 3 inch wafers; nanoparticles ranging from 4 nm to 40 nm in diameter in solution or self-organized on a wafer surface; bulk samples such as sputtering targets. The configuration should be optimized for such sample analysis.<br />2. XRD system must be modular in design to easily exchange optical configurations, modes of operation, and to allow future upgrades in capabilities.<br />3. It is highly desired that alignment of x-ray source, optics, sample and detector is performed via an automated procedure (or alternative method) to minimize or eliminate the need for the operator to perform manual alignment. If an automated procedure, alignment routines and script must be provided for all optical configurations. <br />X-ray Source<br />1. Focused electron beam source, preferably with a 0.4 mm x 12 mm line focus.<br />2. Must have a Cu target with a K_beta filter either in the source or diffracted optics.<br />3. Must have a beam voltage of at least 40 kV with at least 1.8 kW operational x-ray tube power. Higher voltages and output powers are desired.<br />4. It is desired that the source have both line and point source output. Switching between modes of operation must be easy and straightforward without a significant realignment process. This capability is more critical if in-plane measurements are achieved by a 90 degree chi rotation of the sample<br />Goniometer and sample stage/cradle<br />1. Goniometer and cradle system must be capable of achieving scattering geometries to perform in-plane and out-of-plane scans, pole figure, reciprocal space maps, rocking curves, reflectivity, grazing incidence, small angle diffraction and transmission scattering.<br />2. Must have at least a step size of 0.0001 degrees in detector theta and source theta (or sample omega angle if x-ray source is fixed).<br />3. Must include a completely motorized Eularian (or equivalent) cradle mount able to accommodate both 3 inch wafers and small samples. Cradle must have x- and y-translation with at least 10 micron step size, a z-translation with at least a 1 micron step size, as well as full 360 sample azimuthal rotation (phi), and tilt (chi or psi) of at least a quarter circle. It is desired that the sample have additional tilt axes such that once the sample tilt is aligned, phi rotations do not alter the sample tilt alignment.<br />4. Must include a capillary sample stage for transmission small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and diffraction measurements of suspended nanopartcles. It is preferred that the capillary stage has a motorized rotation.<br />5. If additional or alternative sample cradles are needed for a specified measurement outlined in the general capabilities section, those must also be included and described.<br />6.

<p><br />The IPG ELR-10-1550-SF is a single frequency, continuous wave 1550nm, 10 watt laser. It has four output fibers and a narrow 20kHz line width. Its main function will be for photonic Doppler velocimeter (PDV) operations where velocity data will be captured up to 10km/s. The very high power is necessary so that the PDV can capture enough reflected light to deduce the velocity in a multipoint configuration. Furthermore, the laser is equipped with a BNC connector for TTL modulation.</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Ai! r Force Base, OH.  The program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2. Capability to provide Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) 3. Ability to demonstrate systems integration across the aircraft fleet 4. Capability to produce technically competent analyses on the multiple areas covered in the above paragraph 5. Description of previous or current experience in precision targeting systems 6. Show ability to start delivery on or about 14 months ARO.  The ASC/647th AESS/TZ Program Office intends to host an industry day at Wright Patterson Air Force Base at a date to be determined to discuss the capability requirements for the ATP-SE in greater detail.  This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

PA has developed a distribution strategy that includes streaming and video blogging on state.gov, digital video encoding to YouTube, and contracts with thenewsmarket.com, and Pathfire, the two leading internet-based, global providers of video clips to news broadcasters.  The current capacity for this distribution is not meeting the daily demands, and requires doubling the capability just to get to an adequate level of output. Additional increases in media distribution strategies with the regional broadcast hubs across the globe, as well as media support for regional bureaus and posts requires PA to significantly increase our multimedia and multiformatting capabilities.    PA/OBS needs to expedite the delivery of this content to improve global audience reach and 2nd party placement of DOS video clips.   The timely and widespread delivery of this content is a critical success factor in communicating foreign policy and American values to a global audience.
The State Departments broadcast television production facility is a unique, state-of-the-art hybrid digital/analog platform that includes custom designed equipment for specialized applications. Telestream is the manufacturer and systems integrator of the specialized hardware and software that works together with other studio equipment to for digital video encoding and file transfer to external servers.  Telestream is the only company that can enable PA to increase this capacity without re-designing and re-integrating additional equipment at a greater expense for a new digital workflow, and its hardware and software allows for encoding to a diverse range of formats for use all over the world. The Department proposes to enter into this contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C 253 (c) (1) only one available source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Departments requirements.<BR><BR>

7.	SET ASIDE INFORMATION

Currently, as required by FAR Subpart 19.10, Forest Service Acquisitions <$50,000 for A-E in all above A-E NAICS Codes shall be set-aside for emerging small business (defined as ½ the annual revenue of a small business).  

For the Forest Service, A-E NAICS Codes 541310 and 541330 Acquisitions  &#8805;$50,000 but <$100,000 must be set aside for small business.  Other A-E Services, including Surveying and Mapping, are available for unrestricted competition (e.g. large businesses 
are eligible). 

WHAT IS THE FOREST SERVICE DOING?

Pursuant to FAR Part 36, the Forest Service is establishing data files for Architect-Engineer (AE) contractors interested in doing work in the Forest Services Eastern Region, which includes the States of, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and West Virginia. The projects awarded will cost less than $100,000 and will fall within one of the NAICS descriptions shown on this notice.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) has provided a substantial increase in funding and project work to the Forest Service’s Eastern Region. Therefore we are establishing a data file of qualified, interested AE firms so that as approved projects are identified we are positioned to utilize the Short Selection process, as defined in FAR 36.602-5, to relatively quickly and efficiently obtain AE Services.  We also believe the Short AE selection process will improve the competitive opportunity for participation by local firms in the vicinity of the individual project(s).  This is consistent with the ARRA intent. We anticipate the need for a variety of AE services.  Examples of some of the types include, but is not limited to; bridge and large culvert design, low volume road design, design of small warehouses and office rehabs to improved energy usage and safety concerns, design of repairs to small dams and impoundments, design of photovoltaic and other renewable energy systems, design of high efficiency replacement HVAC systems, design of electrical systems and lighting, water and waste water system design, performance of sanitary inspections for water systems and safety inspections for bridges and dams, construction inspection, drafting services, surveying, geotechnical investigation, and environmental (RCRA, CECRLA, CWA, etc.) reviews, inventories, audits and coordination of RCRA and other waste disposal. 

WHAT IS THE SHORT SELECTION PROCESS?

For AE projects with an estimated cost of less than $100,000, agencies may review current date files for eligible AE firms, perform a technical review and evaluation to determine the 3 most highly qualified firms, and have discussions with the 3 firms to determine the best qualified firm for that particular project.  A price proposal will then be requested from the highest rated firm.  If reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second best qualified firm, and so on. The data files will be maintained by State and NAISC code.  The AE’s ability to provide licensed professionals in the State where the project is located (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1) and the firm’s geographic proximity and knowledge of the local  area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AE’s SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exist.

WHAT DOES MY FIRM NEED TO SUBMIT TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND RECEIVE CONSIDERATION FOR FUTURE AE PROJECTS?

Submit one copy of each of the following Documents for Each State and NAICS code of interest.  Each submission should be in a separate envelope with the State and NAISC clearly marked on the out side of the envelope.  Failure to follow this direction may result in miss filing of your submission. 

1.  Page 1 of this Short Selection Sources Sought Solicitation:  Complete Item 3 and Item 6 (put a check mark by NAICS Code/Description for which you are qualified).

2.  CCR Print Out:  Central Contractor Registration is required for award of federal contracts.   www.ccr.gov – search database for your firm and print out results.**  You must be registered in CCR and accept electronic payments in order to be considered for project work.  

3.  SF330, Part 2:  The entire SF330 is posted for your reference (it includes instructions).  SF330, Part 2 needs to be completed and sent in.  

4.  Attach to Part 2 of the SF330, a list of the number of licensed professionals and the States of their licensing for each of the Function codes identified in block 9 of the SF330, part 2.

**NOTE:  At this time (FY09), AE firms must be an emerging small business qualified to receive consideration for USDA Forest Service AE contract awards for A-E projects less than $50,000.00. For NAICS codes 541310 and 541330 between $50,000 and $100,000 in Product Service Codes (PSC) C129, C212, C213, C214, C215 only small business A-E firms are eligible. Dependent upon the socioeconomic status of respondents to this RFI, individual AE projects may be set-aside for 8(a), Hubzone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business firms." 

5.  In addition to one hardcopy, also include in each individual envelope one electronic copy of all required documents in PDF format placed on a standard CD, which is readable on PC’s operating in a windows environment.

6.  Submittals shall be brief and concise.  Only the first 10 pages of a firm’s submittals will be evaluated and consider during the initial review.  Submittals shall be bound with a single staple, paper clip, or binder clip, to allow for easy copying and filing.

<DESC>This contract requires providing approximately 1000 head of yearling goats (or older) with herders, guard and herd dogs, to graze 800-1000 acres of yellow starthistle in a study area on lower Bentz Ridge, Northeast of White Bird, Idaho on the Nez Perce National Forest.  The project area is an open, steep grassland slope bounded on the south by the South Fork White Bird Creek and Pinnacle Creek and on the north by Bentz Ridge.  The objective is to shrink the population extent and density and reduce seed production of yellow starthistle.  Grazing would occur for approximately 6-7 weeks beginning when the yellow starthistle is in the early-flower phase.  This study area was treated using goats in 2006, 2007, and 2008.  A single contract will be awarded for 2009 with three, one-year, optional renewal periods.  Solicitation issued 7/22/09.

<DESC>Extend response date to July 28, 2009 at 2:00 p.m. Alaska time.

Contractor shall assemble and summarize relevant past and ongoing young growth monitoring that pertains to wildlife on the Tonasss National.  From that information develop monitoring protocols for the Forest Plan monitoring questions.

1. Following young-growth treatments, does the cahnge in understory vegeation provide improved habitat for key old-growth species?
•	Identify a monitoring protocol for understory vegetation (vegetation alone).
•	Determine the feasibility for developing correlates between vegetation and an agreed upon list of species, following the process steps in Appendix A
•	Because we do not have information to suggest direct habitat improvement or population responses to changes in understory vegetation for most MIS and other species of concern, and because research supports positive benefits with changes in understory vegetation for Sitka black-tailed deer, the initial focus will be on deer.  Other emphasis species may be identified after the assemblage of literature.
 

2.  Is old growth structure retained in the matrix adequate and is it representative of old growth types across VCUs and across the Forest?

•	The protocol could identify simple spatial queries for agreed upon old growth structural classes (based on the Tongass Size-Density Model)

BACKGROUND

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR), located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, is responsible for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s assistance program for the five Central Asian Republics.  In addition to the Regional Mission in Almaty, Country Offices are located in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan and work in close collaboration with the Regional Mission to carry out USAID development priorities.  Within the Regional Mission, the Office of Health and Education (HE) has primary responsibility for the management of assistance in the health and education sectors.  

USAID/CAR’s objective in health care is to assist the public health systems in the Central Asian Republics to better meet the health needs of vulnerable groups.  Activities are focused on four areas:  1) Contributing to safer medical environments; 2) Strengthening public health capacity; 
3) Improving the quality of health services; and 4) Empowering civil society to better respond to health needs.  

B)  Basic Functions of the Position:

The position is located in the Uzbekistan Country Office (UCO) of the USAID/CAR regional mission.  The incumbent is a member of the USAID/CAR/UCO team and USAID/CAR Health and Education Office team.  The incumbent works under the direct supervision of the USAID/CAR/UCO Country Representative or his/her designee.  The incumbent receives supervisory support and technical guidance from the USAID/CAR Health & Education Office Director based in Almaty.  

The incumbent serves as the senior public health advisor on Uzbekistan to the USAID Uzbekistan Country Office Director, USAID Central Asian Republics (CAR) headquarter-based staff, and Embassy Tashkent.  Job holder shares responsibilities with USAID/CAR regional mission for the development and implementation of public health-related program activities and has direct responsibility for day-to-day coordination and monitoring of all USAID health development activities in Uzbekistan, including activities that implement or support the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  

The employee is responsible for overseeing USAID/CAR initiatives in the health sector in Uzbekistan, as assigned. As such, the employee must have considerable knowledge of health issues in the region, a background in public health programming, and must be effective in developing cooperative working relationships with government officials, international donors, USAID implementing partners and local non-governmental partners.  Incumbent works closely with the Health & Education Office at USAID/CAR regional headquarters’ office in Kazakhstan to ensure that USAID-funded health development activities carried out in Uzbekistan contribute to measurable results that are in accordance with agency regulations, assistance objectives, international ethical guidelines, and public healthcare standards and best practices.

C)  Major Duties and Responsibilities:

The Public Health Management Specialist’s responsibilities and duties shall include, but are not limited to the following:

1) Job holder is the principal public health technical analyst and advisor to the UCO director and USAID/CAR on health-related programming in Uzbekistan.  This includes development of new programs and initiatives that are in accord with the goals, objectives, and policies of Congressional earmarks, directives and Presidential initiatives (e.g., PEPFAR).  Incumbent plays a lead role in strategic planning, project development and drafting of UCO input into the health program area of the Operational Plan (OP) for Uzbekistan.  

To carry out these responsibilities, job holder must stay abreast of changes in the host country public health infrastructure, advising agency management on observed strengths, weaknesses and opportunities.  Specific areas job holder must follow are new levels and trends in health conditions, status of key policies, and legal and regulatory changes that could affect the implementation of health-related programs.  Job holder meets frequently with in-country mid- to senior-level host government health professionals and program directors, as well as health counterparts in non-governmental organizations, private sector, and international organizations.  Through these contacts, the incumbent stays informed and up-to-date on public health matters, especially HIV/AIDS, TB and health systems strengthening in Uzbekistan. 

Job holder condenses the information gathered, analyzes in-country needs and opportunities against objectives in the U.S. Foreign Assistance Framework and advises senior management on how best to deliver in-country public health products and services that reflect international standards and host country policies and regulations for such programs.  Recommendations are made both orally and in writing to USG technical groups (e.g., PEPFAR), embassy management and agency mission and headquarters management.

2) The primary work of the UCO is to implement, monitor and evaluate development programming carried out by contractors and grantees.  Working closely with health professionals based in USAID/CAR Almaty office, job holder takes the lead in managing the life cycle of health programs in Uzbekistan.

Job holder meets with Contracts Officer Technical Representatives (COTRs) and Assistance Officer Technical Representatives (AOTRs), contractors and counterparts on a regular basis, reviewing progress, identifying potential issues before they become problems, and informing the UCO Director and USAID/CAR Health & Education Office Director.  When funding issues, reporting lapses or other administrative irregularities are identified, job holder works with COTR/AOTR in charge of the specific contract or grant and recommends solutions to correct deficiencies.

Job holder reviews documents required for payment, change of activities, requests for continuations, and supplemental awards and makes recommendations to the COTR or AOTR for approval or non-approval.

3) The incumbent serves as USG point of contact on all issues and requests related to PEPFAR including Global Fund (GFATM) grants.  Incumbent is responsible for coordinating USAID representation and documentation related to Global Fund in Uzbekistan, provides input for USG parallel reviews of the country applications to the GFATM, and provides input to the host country government in development of the country’s application to Global Fund.  The incumbent coordinates USG assistance with the GFATM and other donors working in the areas of HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, to leverage resources and avoid duplication.

4) As the primary public health technical liaison, job holder is a key source for keeping host government public health contacts and non-governmental health program counterparts informed about new developments in USAID and USG initiatives (e.g., PEPFAR, President Obama’s new Global Health Initiative), policies and procedures.  Job holder provides timely technical updates that are useful to partners and counterparts in the fight against HIV/AIDS and TB, and meeting other public health challenges in Uzbekistan.

Exceptional interpersonal skills and diplomacy are required to maintain excellent working relationships with all Mission personnel, internal/external contacts, counterparts, shareholders, and clients.  A proven ability to develop and maintain professional relations with the most senior-ranking Central Asia stakeholders (i.e., local international donor representatives, heads of national, state and local health departments, NGO representatives, and other key stakeholders and partners) is required. 

The incumbent must demonstrate: an ability and willingness to collaborate as part of a large team; sensitivity to others; integrity; intellectual curiosity; balanced judgment; the ability to conceptualize – both strategically and programmatically; and an ability to generate trust and build alliances.  In addition, the ability to be responsive to clients’ needs and to adapt to the existing management team by being a good listener, a team builder, and an articulate advocate of USAID/CAR health priorities is required.  

Command of software programs to effectively manage e-mail, word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and graphics presentations is required.

d.  Language skills - Must be fluent in English (level V) and have proven ability to communicate quickly, clearly, and concisely, both orally and in writing.

<DESC>Question: I would like you to better define for us what tasks are envisionedin "range clearance."  

Answer: Range clearance generally includes all activities associated with theremoval of explosives hazards within a defined area to a defined depth.
Typical range clearance tasks include the following:
- Land surveying to delineate the clearance area- Vegetation removal to gain access to the surface and subsurface typicallyincluding the removal of vegetation and trees up to 3" in diameter.- Surface clearance to remove munitions fragments, UXO, range debris, anddiscarded fragments- Geophysical detection and marking of subsurface metallic anomalies typicallyeither using hand-held magnetometers or man-portable/towed digitalelectromagnetic geophysical mapping devices- Subsurface removal of suspected explosive hazards typically accomplished bymanual excavation.- Quality control of the subsurface clearance.

Additional tasks that might be included in a range clearance project wouldinclude the following:- Vegetation removal of all trees and undergrowth to open up line of sightbetween firing and target positions.  This task if accomplished roboticallywould eliminate the need to first perform UXO clearance.- Removal of the top 4-6" of soil from future construction footprints therebyremoving the heaviest metallic fragment concentration mechanically therebyreducing the cost to clear explosive hazards from the remaining subsurface.

<DESC>RECOVERY--RECOVERY--The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting prospective contractors to perform a construction project for Hop Brook Lake Dam Remedial Foundation Grouting, Hop Brook Lake, in the City of Waterbury and the towns of Middlebury and Naugatuck, Connecticut<BR><BR>Hop Brook Lake Dam is located in the City of Waterbury and the towns of Middlebury and Naugatuck, Connecticut. The dam is located on the Hop Brook about 1.4 miles above its confluence with the Naugatuck River. The Corps of Engineers constructed Hop Brook Dam to provide flood protection in the Naugatuck River Watershed in the State of Connecticut. The project is operated as part of a system in conjunction with four other Corps of Engineers flood control reservoirs in the Naugatuck River basin, to reduce flood flows on the Naugatuck and Housatonic Rivers. Construction of the 520 feet long, 97 feet high dam began in December 1965 and was completed in December 1968. <BR><BR>The work of this project involves installing a vertical grout curtain for the dam embankment. The vertical grout curtain will be installed along the same alignment as the foundation cut-off grout curtain that was installed during initial construction. The alignment of the curtain runs from abutment to abutment, and down to the upstream toe in the center, thus forming a V-shape as seen both in plan view and in section view. The curtain consists of three lines; a center line, an upstream line, and a downstream line, with the lines being 5 feet apart. The holes comprising the upstream and downstream lines shall be vertical while the center line shall consist of holes inclined 15% to the south or west along the curtain's alignment. Primary holes shall be 20 feet apart. Holes shall extend from the riprapped upstream dam face down through the riprap and the embankment (0-58 feet thick) and extend an additional 60 feet into the foundation bedrock, a highly fractured and folded schistose gneiss. In order to ease access and perform work on the 2.5:1 riprapped slope, crushed stone shall be placed along the curtain alignment to form an access road. An additional component of this project is the installation of four piezometers, three on the downstream face near the right abutment, and one on the far left abutment.<BR><BR>The government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract as a result of this solicitation. This solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis and evaluated using the Best Value Tradeoff method. The estimated construction cost of this contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990 with a size standard of $33,500,000. The Request for Proposal will be issued on or about July 24, 2009. All interested contractors can download the solicitation at the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). The due date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation. Requests for solicitation documents by telephone, e-mail or fax will not be honored. Instructions for proposal submission and evaluation factors will be provided in the solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration by the New England District. <BR><BR>Note: This amendment changes the estimated issue date to July 24, 2009 and the evaluation method from Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) to Best Value with Tradeoffs.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Walla Walla District plans to award a single Nationwide Indefinite quantity contract (IDC) for a five-year period consisting of a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  The maximum amount the Government may order under this IDC shall not exceed $10 million.  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work as further described in this announcement.  The services will consist of Cost Engineering to support Walla Walla District designation as a Cost Engineering Directory/Center of Expertise.  The requirements under the IDC will be issued through firm-fixed price task orders utilizing the labor and overhead rates accepted with award of the IDC.  The estimated base and option year contract capacity is $2M each period.  Contract options may be exercised early if the contract capacity is utilized before the contract performance period expires.  However, the contract rates do not increase until the annual period for which they were negotiated has elapsed.  If capacity remains available at the expiration of any contract performance period and the Government determines it to be in its best interest to exercise the next contract option period, the unused capacity will be rolled forward for use in the subsequent contract performance period.  The annual rates for the then-current contract period will become effective for both the unused capacity of the previous period and the current annual capacity.  The annual contract rates are fixed prices for the annual period for which they are negotiated and shall not be adjusted as a result of the early exercise of contract options or when unused capacity is rolled forward to subsequent option years.  The contract minimum guarantee of $10,000 may be obligated via issuance of an initial task order concurrent with award of the IDC.  The IDC is anticipated to be awarded in February of 2009.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330 which has a size standard of $4,500,000.00 in average annual receipts.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov/.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 36.209, no contract for any follow-on construction work shall be awarded to the firm that designed the project or its subsidiaries or affiliates.<BR><BR>PROJECT INFORMATION: The proposed contract will be used to primarily support the USACE mission in performing cost engineering services, but may also be used to support other federal agencies such as the US Department of Energy, Office of Environmental Management (DOE), the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the General Services Administration (GSA), Bureau of Reclamation, US Forest Service, and the Department of Transportation (DOT).  Typical projects will include cost engineering services for environmental restoration, waste management, decontamination and decommissioning design, regulatory support, confirmatory sampling, liquid waste site remediation, waste site remediation, burial ground remediation, deactivation, demolition, site security, waste operations, surveillance and maintenance, project management and management controls, miscellaneous restoration, stewardship preparation, independent closure reviews, operate and close utilities confirmatory sampling sites, and contingency review and escalation.  The proposed IDC will support USACE mission in performing cost environmental cleanup, demolition and/or restoration.  The magnitude of the task orders may range from $3,000 to $2 million.   The selected A-E firm must be capable of performing cost estimates for multiple customers with a wide variety of sites across the nation in a manner that complies with Federal, State and Local regulations and laws within timeframes required to meet program objectives.    As a minimum requirement, contractor personnel will be required to obtain Department of Energy badging.  On August 27, 2004, President Bush signed Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/08/20040827-8.html . Based upon this directive, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) developed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS Pub) 201 http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201-1/FIPS-201-1-chng1.pdf , including a description of the minimum requirements for a Federal personal identification verification (PIV). HSPD-12 directs the implementation of a new standardized badging process, which is designed to enhance security, reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy by establishing a mandatory, Government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government to its employees, contractors, and other classes of individuals. The Department of Energy (DOE) began implementing the HSPD-12 program on October 27, 2005.<BR>Only those individuals who meet the minimum requirements under the PIV process will be issued the DOE Common Badge or the follow-on HSPD-12 Standard Badge.<BR> AE firm must have sufficient resources (12 cost personnel) to work at multiple sites for long durations (often up to 30 days).  Task orders under the IDC may be awarded and administered by Walla Walla District or any other USACE District that coordinates and obtains authorization from Walla Walla District for contract capacity/usage.  Firms must demonstrate experience in a broad field of cost engineering for general construction and environmental remediation to include civil, structural, electrical and mechanical systems and environmental remediation processes.  Professional, multi-disciplined, cost engineering services include cost engineering, cost estimating, risk analysis, program and project management, planning and scheduling, cost/schedule performance measurement and change control, and value engineering.  Cost engineering may be required for projects in USACE Districts throughout the United States and at various customer locations in which the USACE provides support, such as Department of Energy sites.  The A-E contractors shall use USACE estimating software MCACES (MII), USACE and DOE work breakdown structure, activity based estimating techniques, baseline cost estimating, risk analysis, critical analysis and scheduling techniques, and other related skills.  The firm selected will also be required to perform cost estimating review in accordance with the Walla Walla Cost Center guidance, perform cost analysis, risk analysis, scheduling, evaluation of management controls, attend meetings, site investigations, prepare Change Order cost estimates and assist in negotiations, if required.  The firm must have cost engineering specialist(s) for each required design discipline, such as architectural, structural, civil, mechanical, environmental and electrical.  The firm's cost engineering specialist(s) must be certified by a professional organization, such as AACE, ICEC, PCEA, etc.  The firm's cost estimators must spend the majority of their time performing cost engineering functions, and must be specifically identified, and their competence indicated by resume, in Section E of the SF 330.  Individual resumes are limited to one page each.  In addition, the firm selected must demonstrate experience in using USACE estimating software MCACES (MII), USACE and DOE work breakdown structure, activity based estimating techniques, baseline cost estimating, risk analysis, critical analysis and scheduling techniques, and other related skills. <BR><BR>In accordance with FAR Subpart 36.209, no contract for any follow-on construction work shall be awarded to the firm that designs the project or its subsidiaries or affiliates.  <BR><BR>SELECTION CRITERIA: A-E selections will be conducted in strict accordance with the announced selection criteria, and in compliance with FAR Subpart 36.6, its supplements and Engineer Pamphlet 715-1-7.  Evaluation of contractor proposals will be based on contractors specialized experience and technical competence in areas of experience such as cost engineering, cost estimating, program and project management, planning and scheduling, risk analysis, cost/schedule performance measurement, security clearances, change control, and value engineering.  Review of professional capabilities for satisfactory performance of work required under this contract or work performed by individual task order requirements.  Review of demonstrated capability and capacity in order for the firm to perform the statement of work as required by USACE, DOE, NNSA, and/or other federal agencies as described in this A-E announcement.
