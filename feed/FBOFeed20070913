<DESC>The U.S. House of Representatives (House) requires an HRMS that provides for the tracking of personnel information and an electronic timecard.  This information shall be stored in a relational database and accessed from interface screens that display the appropriate information for each user.  The specific requirements for each of these areas are identified in Appendix D.

The Office of the Clerk currently collects employee and timecard information on paper that is completed by Human Resource (HR) personnel and employees.  HR personnel enter this information into a DOS based application that was developed in-house.  This application cannot be enhanced to work in future operating system platforms that will be used by the Office of the Clerk.  It also has limited capabilities and cannot be expanded to allow employees to enter and update their information.

The current HRMS needs to be replaced with a new system that can run on the current platform and allows access to HR personnel, Office Managers, and employees using a role based model that displays the appropriate information for each user.  This system should provide automated time card capabilities and interfaces to review, modify, and enter information for approximately 300 employees.

This effort will include the delivery of an automated HRMS that allows the data entry and storage of payroll and employee information for all employees of the Office of the Clerk. The system must allow the data entry of hours worked for each employee to take place from the various offices within the Office of the Clerk's organization. In addition, the system must provide pre-defined reports as well as provide the capability to produce user defined Ad Hoc reports. The Contractor must provide customization to the application, if necessary, to meet all the mandatory requirements as outlined in the requirements document.  All requirements are outlined in the requirements document in Appendix D.

Description of Tasks/Work:

The Office of the Clerk requires Contractor program and technical services encompassing the implementation of an automated HRMS.

Installation and Implementation of the System.
Upon contract award, the Office of the Clerk will review the implementation plan that was prepared as part of the proposal, and either
approve the plan or recommend changes.  If the Office of the Clerk recommends changes, the Office of the Clerk and the Contractor
will work together until a final Implementation Plan meets the needs of the Office of the Clerk.  Once the final Implementation Plan is
agreed to, and upon written notification from the Office of the Clerk, the Contractor will proceed with the installation and 
implementation of the system.

Requirements:  See Appendix D

Deliverable: Fully functional HRMS that meets all mandatory requirements in Appendix D.

The following schedule applies to submission of quotes and the product demonstration for this RFP:

Clarification Questions Due*	October 9,  2007

16.0	  INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in ITSS and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://web1.itss.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current GSA Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
     Obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

Submit the Invoice Acceptance Document only once in IT-Solutions Shop.  Edit the existing document if changes are necessary.  Submitting multiple copies only delays the processing.

Submit the Invoice only once in the Finance website.  Edit the existing document if changes are necessary.  Submitting multiple copies only delays the processing.

Make sure the Act Number from the purchase order is displayed on the invoice.

If the invoice is for Time and Materials and Labor Hour Contracts, make sure the Service Month is on the invoice.

Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are exactly the same.

Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don?t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

If an invoice is rejected, the Vendor must submit a corrected invoice in both systems, using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. ?R? to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice.  This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

A scanned copy of the invoice and any required backup documentation must be attached to the Acceptance Document in ITSS.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Client Representative (CR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA PM can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.


	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted IAW FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:    
52.212-4(g) Invoice. 
(1) The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized) to the address designated in the contract to receive invoices. An invoice must include --
(i) Name and address of the Contractor;
(ii) Invoice date and number;
(iii) Contract number, contract line item number and, if applicable, the order number;
(iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of the items delivered;
(v) Shipping number and date of shipment, including the bill of lading number and weight of shipment if shipped on Government bill of lading;
(vi) Terms of any discount for prompt payment offered:
 (vii) Name and address of official to whom payment is to be sent;
(viii) Name, title, and phone number of person to notify in event of defective invoice; and
(ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
(x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.
(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer?Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer?Other Than Central Contractor Registration), or applicable agency procedures.
(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.
(2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.

 Other Information Relating to Successful Invoice Processing.

Due to Congressional Mandate and the Policy Memo from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, all purchase order vendor data (including contracts) must match the data in the Vendor Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Finance is now rejecting purchase orders, purchase order modifications and invoices having data that does not match CCR information.  This includes all orders regardless of remaining value.  Contact the GSA Contracting Officer or GSA Project Manager for further information or assistance.

Review contractor registration, individual contract personnel registration and contract registration in ITSS on a regular basis to ensure all information is correct and up-to-date.  This will help in processing invoices as well as task order actions successfully.

It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to negotiate on a sole source basis with Illumina, Inc. 9885 Towne Centre Dr, San Diego, CA 92121-1975, to provide the Infinium HumanHap 550 Whole-Genome Genotyping Kit for a period of six months from 09/07 - 03/08.  The genotyping kits provide reagents for experiments to investigate the genetic change in cells.  The genotyping kits will be used to explore the genome at >550,000 spots that are known to have variations in cancer cell lines. The kits will be used to score for copy numbers at each of these spots, which indicates the loss or gain of genome at these spots. 

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the genotyping kits from Illumina are unique because it allows for the evaluation of a maximum number of loci >550,000 in the genome with known variationshe sorbent.  It is an automated process which allows for increased reproducibility as compared to previous packing techniques. It increases packing density, lifetime and improved performance.  With an increase in the HPLC purification process it will require columns that perform reproducible separations efficiently under a diverse set of conditions for a extended period of time.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the Size Standard is 500 employees. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to negotiate on a sole source basis with Phenomenex, Inc 411 Madrid Avenue, Torrence, CA 90501-1430, to provide analytical and preparative high performance liquid chromatography columns (HPLC) for a period of six months from 09/30/07 - 03/30/08.  These columns will be used to purify and correct the identity of the compound of interest.  This will be achieved by separating the compounds of interest in reaction mixtures and unwanted products and refining the purification of target molecules. The NCGC laboratory is developing an increased number of target molecules of increased complexity with numerous functional groups in a single molecule.  With an increase in the development of target molecules it is necessary to purchase an increased amount of preparative HPLC columns. These columns provide the means to efficiently and reproducibly purify target molecules with a wide range of functionality and chemical properties.

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the Phenomenex HPLC columns have a patented Axia Packing Technology where they are packed in an axial compression step that eliminates decompression of the sorbent.  It is an automated process which allows for increased reproducibility as compared to previous packing techniques. It increases packing density, lifetime and improved performance.  With an increase in the HPLC purification process it will require columns that perform reproducible separations efficiently under a diverse set of conditions for a extended period of time.  This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.

<CONTACT>Sharon A Harper, Contracting Officer, Phone 757-864-2474, Fax 757-864-8467, Email Sharon.A.Harper@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA, LaRC intends to negotiate soley with Alliant Tech Systems, Inc. to modify Contract NNL05AA06B to increase the maximum order limitation to $49 Million.  The contract was awarded non-competitively to Alliant Tech Systems (formerly ATK-GASL) on October 10, 2005 and is for an on-going requirement for Scramjet Flow Path Technology Research.  The scope of work will not change as a result of this modification, which is to provide and maintain the capability for the design and fabrication of aero-propulsion test hardware, the operation and management of specialized test facilities, and the testing of hypersonic propulsion flow path concepts at duplicated flight Mach numbers from 4 to 20.  The work under contract NNL05AA06B is controlled through the issuance of performance based task orders and provide for:	(1) the operation and application of shock-heated and combustion-propulsion flow path research at conditions that duplicate flight across the atmosphere from statis sea level to near orbital.  Specifically as part of this activity, is the operation and management of the Government Furnished Hypersonic Pulse Facility (HYPULSE) in either shock-expansion tunnel or reflected-shock tunnel configurations.  (2)  The acquisition of facility and propulsion flow path data and the application of data processing tools to provide well defined test conditions and performance of test articles.  These data include, but are not limited to visual and laser-based diagnostic techniques.  (3) The conduct of hypervelocity aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic research in a shock-heated tunnel at test gas flows up to Mach 20 simulation.  (4)  Design and manufacture of research test hardware consisting of specialized aero-propulsion test facility components and engine flow path components.  Key to the performance of this effort is NASA's HYPULSE shock tunnel facility that can be operated as a shock-expansion tunnel that is unique among hypersonic test facilities in that it can deliver a hypervelocity air test gas flow which closely approximates the air encountered in flight at Mach numbers up to 20.  In addition, other Government facilities and test hardware located at the contractor facility provide test capabilities that complement NASA facilties.  Unique among these is the Flight-Accelleration Simulation Test (FAST) facility, which supports other NASA Center's Advanced Reusable Transportation (ART) program.	These apparatus have become integrated into the contractor infrastructure sharing air and propellant supplies, vacuum systems, electrical and data systems.  The HYPULSE and FAST facilities are Government Furnished Property pursuant to FAR Part 45.  The proposed modification will continue to use an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract with performance based task orders over the remaining 3 year period of performance.  Unforseen increases in collaborative work requirements and a reemphasis on hypersonics research have resulted in the rapid growth of this contract from what was originally planned.  NASA/LaRC intends to increase the maximum order limitation under NNL05AA06B with Alliant Tech Systems via a modification to the existing contract on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2), purusant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Oral communications are acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>Lakehurst Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst New Jersey has a requirement for the following items in support of the H-53 Helicopter Program: HP L1940T 19-inch TFT Flat Panel Display, Five (5) each, P/N-EM869AA#ABA; ProLiant ML370 G5 Tower Server, Five (5) each, w/various component parts; HP Care Pack, 5 Years, 4 Hours, 24x7, Proliant ML370, one (1) each, P/N-U8083E; HP T750 Low Voltage NA/JP UPS, one (1) each, P/N-378439-D71; HP SDLT II 600 GB, Data Cartridge, one (1) each, P/N-Q2020A; and HP USB Smart  Card Keyboard, one (1) each, P/N ED707AA#ABA. The hardware will be used to house software for helicopter units deployed with the Intergrated Mechanical Diagnostic (IMD) System and NALCOMIS OOMA. The IMD software database will coexist on the same server with the NALCOMIS OOMA software database. NALCOMIS OOMA software requires only HP ML370 severs in the attached configurations do to drive formatting, operating system formatting, software loading, software maintenance, and training purposes. Also, NALCOMIS OOMA field activity (SPAWARS) requires the attached product support contract provided by Hewlett Packard (HP). The Government intends to procure these items under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(C) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. An HP sole source procurement of the ML370 server hardware is required as the IMD software must coexist upon these servers. Alternatives are to procure redundant servers for all IMD/OMA sites, which is both cost and space prohibitive.  The cognizant field activity for NALCOMIS OOMA (SPAWARS) has defined the HP ML370 configuration as the "fleet" configuration. To open the procurement  to other vendors  would expose the OOMA to peculiarities in operating system loading, disc configuration, vendor support contracts, file copy protocols, etc. Therefore HP ML370 servers are the only solution for meeting the mission essential needs of the PMA's 261, 276, 299.  HP, of Greenbelt, MD is the only known authorized source for direct distribution of the specialized part numbers listed above. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which may be considered by the government in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with  (OSI) Orthopedic Systems Inc. 30031 Ahern Avenue, Union City, CA  94587 for the OSI Modular Table System.  This OSI Modular Table System is a table that has several interchangeable tops using only one frame.  The orthopedic trauma top provides a complete, powered orthopedic table for trauma procedures.  Its unique composite table top design optimizes radiographic capabilities.  The old style legs have been replaced with a new Traction Arc.  The Traction Arc provides constant traction on the patient's leg when adduction and abduction is required.  Because of the unique Traction Arc design, there is no need for a leg spar allowing unrestricted access for the surgeon and C-Arm.  The complete trauma top easily positions patients and maintains either skin or skeletal traction.  The Jackson Spinal Top complete with sling provides the most advanced technology possible for spinal surgery.  The Jackson Spinal Top reduces venal caval compression, minimizes epidural venus bleeding and improves visualization.  The 360 degree rotational capabilities allow the surgeon to rapidly and safely rotate the patient on a horizontal axis.  The Imaging Top meets all radiographic requirements.  The table's rotational features provide quicker lateral views and less potential for the sterile field to be contaminated since it is not necessary to rotate the C-Arm.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Vendors who wish to identify their interest and ability to provide an alternative item that will meet the capabilities and functionality described above may notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, no later than September 21, 2007 2:00 p.m.  Such notification must include a complete description of the equipment that is required including narrative and capabilities as described above.  Responses may be sent to Kathleen.Policicchio@va.gov or mailed to Kathleen Policicchio, Contracting Officer, (04A1-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206.  Upon receipt of any such notifications, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with sole source negotiations.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>A shield room is to be constructed to enclose the 1 MeV output section of the pulsed x-ray source.  The room is designed to attenuate scattered x-rays and to provide a shielded, interlocked door to prevent access to the x-ray beam or scattered x-rays.  The x-rays are produced by a 1MeV electron beam incident on a high-Z target. The electron beam has a peak current of 1 A at a pulse width of 1 ?s with a repetition rate of 100 Hz.  The main shield room structure is not intended to attenuate the primary x-ray beam, it is only intended to attenuate scattered x-rays and to prevent personnel from accidentally entering the x-ray area.  An additional beam stop will block the primary x-rays.

Engineering analysis of the floor loading and seismic requirements has been done by The Delphi Groupe, Inc.  This analysis shows that the weight of 3/4" of lead in the walls and ceiling along with the steel supporting structure does not exceed the floor loading of the existing building.  The structure must be built to the design provided and anchored as shown to assure meeting all structural requirements.

The lead provides shield from x-rays and must use interlocking bricks or equivalent to assure that there are no "hot spots" of x-ray flux outside of the shield room. The door must provide the equivalent shielding of the walls, have sufficient overlap to prevent x-ray "hot-spots" at any point while the door is closed. The door shall be electrically operated with industry standard safety features to prevent injury of any person who inadvertently is in the path of the door. Be capable of being opened manually in case of a power failure, and have interlock switches to tie into the x-ray interlock system preventing the beam to be turned on unless the door is securely closed.

The Subcontractor must show at least 10 years of experience in the installation of radiation shielding systems and be able to provide references of recent, similar projects.  It is preferred that the contractor has experience in installations at DOE facilities.

The FAA reserves the right to add incumbent contractors and/or other sources which meet the criteria and have performed satisfactorily on previous procurements.  Accordingly, it has been determined that only firms meeting the following minimum requirements will be solicited: Responses are solicited only from small business concerns.  If the results of the market survey determine a sufficient number of Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB/8a) are capable of providing these batteries, the requirement will be set-aside exclusively for SEDBs.

<DESC>Modification is issued to extend closing date to reflect:
OCTOBER 01, 2007
The Coast Guard will be issuing a solicitation to perform the open, inspection, report and overhaul of Philadelphia Gear Pumps, model numbers 46123R253, 46123R251RH and 46123R252LC.  This will be a requirements type contract with one (01) base year and four (04) option years.  The Philadelphia Gear Pumps are utilized on the 378? WHEC Cutters.  This requirement will also include:  (1) the overhaul/repair of model numbers 46123R253,46123R251RH and 46123R252LC.  This will be other than full and open competition using the Philadelphia Gear Company only.  The work shall be performed in accordance with Philadelphia Gear Company specifications, standards and recommended procedures for overhaul of the listed pumps.  All parts and facilities used during the overhaul shall be Philadelphia Gear Company facilities and parts.  Technical Data and/or drawings pertaining to Philadelphia Gear Company parts/services are proprietary to the OEM.  Accordingly it is believed that this non-availability of technical date precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center from obtaining competition as they are  available from this source.  See number notes 22, and 26

<DESC>NAICS Code: 336212   Amendment #2 Technical Questions and Answers Question 1:  Please clarify specification (2) which states; "The Floor shall be flush (i.e., no wheel mounts in the shelter)."? Is this saying that there can be no protrusions into the trailer interior from an enclosed wheel  well? It appears that this would contradict the trailer side view sketch.  Answer:  The sketch of the trailer side view was not intended to provide details, regarding the wheel mounts.  The wheels shall be mounted so that the 8' overall trailer width is not exceeded, while still ensuring that the  wheel well does not penetrate into the trailer's interior.   Question 2:  Where is the Storage Compartment Access Door to be located, per specification (31)?  Answer:  The location of the storage compartment shall be provided after award, but it is envisioned to be placed at the roadside corner  near the front of the trailer.  The access door's construction shall be a heavy-duty, vented, pre-framed swing-up door, with an integrated keyed flush lock. Question 3:  Please clarify the dimensions and placement of the Heavy Duty Vertical Posts, per specification (16)?  Answer:  This 2 ?"  dimension is the width of the vertical posts described in Specification (15). Question 4:  Are there any specs for the Jib Crane (ie: Crane weight, height, length)?  The most important question is how much weight the crane is rated to lift and at what length out from the base, as this would have a  direct impact on how much support will be required in the roof/sidewalls, per Specifications (17, 18).  Answer:  The crane has a weight of 140 lbs and user-adjustable boom lengths of 43, 55, and 66 inches.  The boom height can be adjusted from 0 to 84 inches and the crane has extended and retracted  capacities of 800 and 1500 lbs, respectively.  It is expected that use of the crane will not involve lifting objects greater than 200 lbs with the boom in its fully extended position and positioned at a 43 degree angle.

<DESC>Our questions are simple and we would appreciate it if you could post these with a response as a modification. 

1.  Do the customer require a new licence for the ICDD database, and if so, PDF-2 or PDF-4? 

2. Does the customer want a power conditioner or a UPS backup system, and if it is a battery backup, for how long should the battery last in the event of a power failure. 

ANSWERS:

A new PDF database should be included. PDF 2 will suit our needs.

The power conditioner is not an uninterruptible power supply, merely a power conditioner.


MSHA  X-Ray Diffractometer System Requirements

The base system will include a minimum 2.2 kW generator for use with long fine line focus copper x-ray tubes with a 6 o takeoff angle.  The goniometer will be a vertical Bragg-Brentano focused beam configuration, with a radius of between 185mm and 290mm and an angular range spanning  0-120 degrees two theta at minimum.  A sample spinner will be included. A theta compensating variable divergence slit will ensure that the irradiated area of the sample remains constant and permit a 15mm minimum length of sample to be constantly irradiated.  Optics common to all proposed systems will also include divergent and diffracted beam Soller slits. An automated sample changer with a minimum capacity of 40 samples will be included. The system price will also include the cost of 100 sample holders designed for samples deposited on 25 mm diameter silver membrane filters and the cost of a closed circuit water recirculator for cooling the anode.
Software packages provided with the system will provide automated instrument control and data acquisition functions, and quantitative analysis with sophisticated user defined and controlled profile fitting and  phase identification  capabilities.

The first configuration will include a diffracted beam monochromator, an ionized gas or scintillation counter, and associated slits.
The second variation will replace the conventional point counter and graphite monochromator with a beta filter and a high speed detector capable of simultaneous data acquisition across a range of 1.5o two theta minimum at maximum intervals of .02o two theta or less. Alternatively, an energy dispersive detector optimized for copper k-alpha radiation can be quoted.
The third configuration will  include a 16kW rotating anode generator and accessory equipment quoted as an option. All systems should include the cost of an electric power conditioning system suitable for the electrical service requirements of the instrument.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Iridium-based airborne telemetry system
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-09132007-RSL
<RESPDATE>092407
<ARCHDATE>10092007
<CONTACT>Jeanette Matthews, Senior Procurement Specialist, Phone 702-295-2700, Fax 702-295-9112, Email matthejl@nv.doe.gov - Jeanette Matthews, Senior Procurement Specialist, Phone 702-295-2700, Fax 702-295-9112, Email matthejl@nv.doe.gov
<DESC>Sources sought
The Remote Sensing Laboratory (RSL) proposes to test Iridium-based telemetry systems to evaluate applicability for an on-going telemetry application.  The proposed tests are multi-purpose:  1) To determine if Iridium technology can satisfy RSL requirements, and 2) To identify potential vendors if the technology is applicable.

The system shall be FAA certified for fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft installations.

The system shall provide dial up data service at 2400 bps.  TCIP service is also desired.

The system shall be available as a two channel system for simultaneous voice and data transmission.  However, the demonstration of voice and data capabilities may be conducted with a single channel system if a two channel loaner system is unavailable. 

The RSL system acquires data at a rate of 160 characters per second (~1600 bps).  The RSL system buffers the acquired data and sends it to the telemetry system.   When errors occur, data is resent so that all data is eventually transferred error-free.  The primary reason for the demonstration is to determine if the 2400 bps capability of the Iridium is sufficient to support the 1600 bps acquisition rate (plus inherent resends, disconnects, etc.) with an acceptable data lag.  The telemetry system shall have sufficient excess data transfer capability so that the lag of telemetered data shall be no more than 5 minutes per acquisition hour.  For example, at the end of a 3 hour acquisition period, the data lag shall be less than 15 minutes.  

The system shall have a maximum reconnect time of 2 minutes after a satellite service dropout.

The vendor shall provide a system for setup and qualification testing for a minimum of two weeks.

The system will be installed by the RSL in a B200 fixed wing aircraft for static and flight testing.  The RSL aircraft already has an Iridium-compatible antenna installed (Sensor Systems 867-1575-109).

Interested parties that can meet the above specifications shall email matthejl@nv.doe.gov with information regarding any costs associated with a two week equipment loan and for a maximum connect time of 15 hours.

<SUBJECT>B -- genetic tests from univer of chicago
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health and the Office of Rare Diseases plan to procure on a sole source basis with the University of Chicago Genetics Genetic Services Laboratory, to  develop new genetic tests under the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) Collaboration, Education, and Test Translation Program for Rare Genetic Diseases. The program that promotes new genetic test development and access to clinical laboratories for the public.  This program accelerates the translation of genetic tests from research laboratory to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified clinical laboratories.   The University of Chicago Genetics Genetic Services Laboratory will establish the first available molecular genetic testing in a CLIA approved clinical laboratory for the rare diseases described below and/or alternative rare diseases for test translation within the budget outlined.  
Description of Genetic Disorders and Genes for Test Translation:
Genetic Disorder: Autosomal Recessive Polymicrogyria		Gene:  GPR56		
Polymicrogyria is a disorder of cortical brain development that can result in a spectrum of developmental problems from birth ranging from mild cognitive, learning problems to severe mental retardation, cerebral palsy and seizure disorders.  Polymicrogyria, due to a mutation of the GPR56 gene is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder. GPR56, a family B G protein-coupled receptor, is widely expressed throughout the body and appears to be essential during human cerebral cortical development and patterning.  Current testing is only available in Germany.  Testing is not available in a CLIA-approved laboratory in the United States. Thus, affected individuals or at-risk family members do not have access to genetic testing except on a research basis, which means that testing results cannot be reported back to the individual.  The establishment of testing in a clinical laboratory would allow for presymptomatic, prenatal, and/or carrier testing.   
 Genetic Disorder:  Congenital Hemidysplasia with Ichthyosiform Erythroderma and Limb Defects (CHILD) syndrome	Gene: NSDHL		
CHILD (congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects) syndrome is a rare X-linked dominant inherited disorder characterized by birth defects of several organ systems, including the skin, the viscera, and the musculoskeletal and central nervous systems.  Patients with CHILD syndrome have been found to have a mutation in the NSDHL gene encoding for an enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Greater than two thirds of cases reported occur in females. The gene has been localized to Xq28 and encodes for 3beta-hydroxy sterol dehydrogenase involved in the oxidative decarboxylation of sterol C-4 methyl groups.  Both heterozygous nonsense and heterozygous missense mutations have been identified.   Currently only analyte measurement (biochemical testing) is available.  Molecular Testing is not available in a CLIA-approved laboratory in the United States. Thus, affected individuals or at-risk family members do not have access to genetic testing except on a research basis, which means that testing results cannot be reported back to the individual.  The establishment of testing in a clinical laboratory would allow for presymptomatic, prenatal, and/or carrier testing.   
Genetic Disorder:  X-Linked Alport Syndrome (XLAS)	Gene: COL4A5		
Alport syndrome is characterized by renal, cochlear, and ocular involvement. About 80% of Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in COL4A5 and is inherited in an X-linked manner. The hallmark of Alport syndrome is microscopic hematuria (microhematuria). Males with X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) have persistent microhematuria from early in life. Over 90% of females with XLAS have microscopic hematuria.  All males with XLAS develop proteinuria and eventually progressive renal insufficiency, which leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Overall, about 60% reach ESRD by age 30 years, and 90% by age 40 years. About 10% of females with XLAS develop ESRD by age 40, and about 30% by age 60.  Diminished hearing is usually detectable by late childhood or early adolescence in boys with XLAS; the hearing loss is progressive and about 80%-90% of these males have sensorineural deafness by age 40 years. In females with XLAS, hearing loss is less frequent and tends to occur later in life.   The spectrum of ocular lesions include anterior lenticonus which is virtually pathognomonic of Alport syndrome; other ocular findings include a maculopathy consisting of whitish or yellowish flecks or granulations in the perimacular region, corneal endothelial vesicles (posterior polymorphous dystrophy), and recurrent corneal erosion.  Currently, the only available genetic testing is through laboratories in Germany and Belgium.  Molecular Testing is not available in a CLIA-approved laboratory in the United States.  The establishment of testing in a clinical laboratory would allow for presymptomatic, prenatal, and/or carrier testing.
1) Develop the Collaborative Team for genetic test translation:  The University of Chicago will develop collaborations with appropriate researchers, clinicians and advocacy appropriate for the rare disease identified for translation 
2) Develop the Molecular Testing Platform:  The University of Chicago Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory will establish and make available molecular testing for the rare diseases identified for genetic test translation.  In addition, the University of Chicago will assure:
- Validation of Test Results:  Sequence based assays are largely considered self validating.  The laboratory will obtain samples with known mutations to test in a blinded fashion for formal test validation purposes prior to their implementation.  This laboratory is experienced in offering full sequencing as a diagnostic test.
- Plans to Analyze Variants of Unknown Significance (VOUS):  The University of Chicago will follow appropriate guidelines of the CETT Program for addressing VOUS
3) Develop Educational Materials for Clinicians, patients and Geneticists regarding use of genetic testing in the diagnosis of the rare diseases under genetic test translation
4) Create/expand a Gene Review document within 1 year of establishing genetic testing for the rare diseases identified for genetic test translation
4) Collect and store de-identifiable clinical description and genetic mutation information obtained at the time of genetic testing.
Deliverables

?	CLIA-certified molecular diagnostic testing for the three rare diseases described above or alternative rare diseases defined through the period of performance will be made available, as evidenced by a public advertisement or website announcement to that effect. We expect that this will occur within 12 months of the receipt of payment for this service.
?	Development of Educational Materials for clinicians and individuals and families with the rare diseases translated to clinical tests to accompany the establishment of clinical genetic testing for these rare diseases.
?	Plan for collecting and storing non-identifiable genetic information regarding the clinical genetic testing over time.  The NCBI, NLM is committed to working with each rare genetic testing collaborating team through the CETT Program in developing the collection and storage plan.
?	Commitment to develop Gene Review within 1 year of funding for rare disease genetic test development
?	Commitment to 5 year reporting of genetic test usage, to include: 
o	Number of molecular tests ordered and which genes were identified with the molecular mutation
o	Number of samples with VOUS for which research groups are contacted for help with interpretation and/or follow-up parental samples are obtained to help with interpretation 
o	Information on the use and value of the educational materials to help clinicians and families to understand the genetic test
However, if any other interested party believes that they can meet the requirements they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain detailed documentation to allow the government to perform a proper evaluation.  Respondents will not be notified of evaluation results.  The closing date will be 10 calendar days after publication.  All vendors/prospective contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor?s Registration (www.ccr.gov) prior to award date.  If not registered or active by that date, vendor proposals will be considered non responsive.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), intends to award a cost plus fixed fee type contract to WarpIV Technologies, Inc. of San Diego, CA.  SSC San Diego intends to acquire, on a sole source basis, the support for the design, implementation and use of a portable, scalable Standard Simulation Architecture (SSA) for emulation of tactical communication networks using High Performance Computing machines (supercomputers) to achieve real-time performance.  The SSA is proprietary and a highly complex software architecture comprised of 260 thousand lines of C++ code that WarpIV owns including the rights. A license is required to use the code. The performance period is anticipated to be one year in duration, with one, one year option.  This procurement will be conducted using other than full and open competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  This effort is a final procurement with no potential follow-on work.  WarpIV Technologies has a unique and specialized capability to design, implement and use the SSA and currently is the only firm that is capable of providing continued development of the SSA for SSC San Diego. WARP IV Technologies is the only known support provider for these items and has gained specialized knowledge and experience over the last 17 years, the value of which would not be recovered through competition.  The use of any other contractor for this acquisition would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government based on the specialized knowledge and experience acquired by WarpIV Technologies under the prior subcontract.  This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available.

The resulting contract will require the contractor to provide personnel, supervision and services necessary to maintain Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) F-15SG and United States Air Force (USAF) F-15C/D and F-15E aircraft based with the 366th Maintenance Group (366 MXG), located at Mountain Home AFB (MHAFB) except  for those government furnished property and services.  The contractor shall provide personnel, supervision and services necessary to maintain Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) F-15SG and United States Air Force (USAF) F-15C/D and F-15E aircraft based with the 366th Maintenance Group (366 MXG), located at Mountain Home AFB (MHAFB) except  for those government furnished property and services.

Additionally, the contractor shall provide flying and maintenance scheduling, database management and analysis, centralized control (a maintenance operations center), maintenance training functions and specialized support functions in accordance with the PWS.  The 366th Maintenance Group is responsible for maintenance of all 70+ assigned F-15C/D, F-15E and two trainer aircraft, associated aircraft systems, support equipment and munitions.  The RSAF build-up will add an additional 10 F-15SG aircraft with a possible surge to 20 aircraft for short periods of time to the MXG total.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action for a Sole Source Procurement

SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT OF one LMS-16 W/SIR-LVT Workstation manufactured by Northrop Grumman.

DESC:	INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT TO NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION MISSION SYSTEMS, NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS, DIVISION.  The Air Force, Edwards Air Force Base, CA, intends to award a Sole Source purchase order to Northrop Grumman Corporation Mission Systems, Network Communications Division, 9326 Spectrum Center Blvd, San Diego, CA 92123. NAICS is 334220 and small business size standard of 750 employees.  The Sole Source purchase will be for the following item:

MODEL:
Line item 1: LMS-16 W/SIR-LVT, qty 1, 
Manufactured by Northrop Grumman

DESCRIPTION:

The LMS has the following function requirements: 

?The Link Management System (LMS) enables Joint Interface Control Officers (JICO) to manage tactical data link networks.
?LMS is a workstation-based Link 16 management and network level diagnostic tool.
?LMS actively monitors and manages Link 16 Radar Frequency (RF) network information during live operations.
?LMS interfaces directly with a Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Low Volume Terminal (LVT) to transmit and receive J-series messages, and decode JTIDS RF signals to provide Link 16 troubleshooting metrics to LMS-16 displays.
?LMS assists JICO and other network managers detect problems in real time that interfere with generating a coherent tactical picture.
?LMS automatically alerts operators to existing and potential problems, and records data for later analysis.
?LMS provides a current tactical situation display.
?LMS display has a JICO white board option that projects a display depicting a real-time, color-coded update of the status of each participant in the network.
?LMS has a Network Summary Display that provides an assessment of total link performance to include relationships between Individual Units (IUs), connectivity, equipment failures and resets, performance comparisons, total track load per frame by ID, and relayer usage per frame.
?LMS Tactical Window can depict IUs with range circles centered on them, indicating line-of-sight limitations.
?LMS Information Window shows which IUs are being received only by relay, and tells if data from individual IUs contain errors or erasures.  Other connectivity information includes range, time and position qualities, amount of surveillance capacity use, track load, average track age, and which unit is acting as forwarding unit for a unit whose data is being forwarded.
?Transmission security on the data link is achieved by hopping among 51 possible frequencies in a pseudorandom pattern.  A decoding algorithm provides some, but not complete, protection from errors (incorrect data) and erasures (missing data).  The LMS tabulates erasures and displays the percentage for each frequency in a bar graph.  It also displays erasures by word.  Green indicates the percentage of good words; correctable errors are orange; and decode failures are red.
?LMS Trend Windows provide historical information on PPLI connectivity, range, surveillance utilization, time slot duty factor measurements, erasure levels, and distribution of Track IDs.  The operator can focus on one IU or compare performances among IUs.
?LMS operator can observe how the network capacity has been allocated to functional groups to determine if any IUs require more capacity to prevent loss of data and reallocate time slot assignments.
?The Transmit Time Slot Reference Window provides a graphic display of the 12-second JTIDS frame as defined by the network design.

Please note this is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the required product.  Responses may be sent via email to rachel.cavanna@edwards.af.mil or mailed to AFFTC/PKEAD, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Rachel Cavanna.

The award will be made for the purchase of a advertising media package marketing the Tennessee Army National Guard.

This procurement is being conducted under FAR  Part 6.302-1, for Other than Full and Open Competition and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to USPFO for Tennessee Contracting Division Attn: Majo r John W. Anders, PO Box 41502 Nashville, Tennessee, 37204, or sent by email to john.anders@ng.army.mil . Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted. Responses to this notice must be submitted by 3:30 PM CST, Friday, September 14, 2007. A determi nation not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.     The point of contact  for this request is john.anders@ng.army.mil. This request for justification for other than full and open competition is for an on-site advertising package for the University of Tennessees Football and Basketball program.  The recommended vendor to fulfil l this requirement is the company of, Host Communications, Incorporated.  This company is under contract with the University of Tennessee for marketing activities for the 2007 football and basketball season.  The Tennessee Army National Guard would like to  use this company to market them during the home games for the 2007 football and basketball season.  This kind of concept for this particular venue is not otherwise available to the Government.2.	In an effort to increase the number of people enlisting in t he  Tennessee National Army Guard (TNARNG) on a game day representatives from the TNARNG shall be allowed to set up a Game Day display in order to educate spectators about the opportunities available in the Tennessee Army National Guard. 3.The total estima ted value of this advertising package shall not exceed $85,000.00.4.	The Statutory Authority as noted in the Federal Acquisition Regulation part 6.302-1 is satisfied based on the fact that there is only one responsible source for fulfilling this requiremen t in the vicinity of Knoxville, Tennessee, and that there are no other supplies or services that will satisfy the agency requirements for this particular requirement. 5.	The University of Tennessee is considered by the general population of Knoxville to be  the largest collegiate football and basketball team in that area of Tennessee, and is the only sports organization in the area with the potential to provide an advertising media capable of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic group tha t the Tennessee Army National Guard wishes to recruit. 6. Efforts to solicit other contractors have not been made as the University of Tennessee is the only collegiate team in the East Tennessee region for this particular venue capable of reaching the desi red number of people in the demographic group that the Tennessee Army National Guard wishes to recruit. 7.The anticipated cost of this acquisition is determined fair and reasonable by comparison of prices proposed in other advertisement packages of this na ture. The price proposed for the advertisement and marketing efforts with the University of Tennessee is $85,000.00. 8.Efforts were made to identify other sources of competition by searching for vendors registered under the North American Industry Classifi cation System (NAICS) code of 541840 for Display Advertising in Tennessee. No other sports teams in the Middle Tennessee area were identified in this search tha t could provide an advertisement package as required for this particular requirement except for, International Sports Properties, Incorporated.9.Host Communications, Incorporated is the only responsible source identified in the market research that could p rovide an advertising package of this type in the East Tennessee area. 10.Based upon the market research conducted by this office there were no other sources that could have expressed an interest in this acquisition. 11.No actions to remove barriers to com petition will be taken, as the University of Tennessee is the only collegiate football and basketball team in East Tennessee who can provide advertising to potentially reach the desired number of people in the demographic group for potential recruits into the Tennessee Army National Guard. 12.This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

The critical factor in making any cost / technical trade-off is not the spread between technical scores, but rather, the significance of that difference.  The significance of the spread in scores will be determined on the basis of what it would cost the Government to take advantage of it.  Award may not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work.  The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and advantageous to the Government.  

Awards may be made without further negotiations.  Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a price and technical standpoint, which the offeror can submit to the Government.

A portable testing stand with an enclosure with effective x-ray shielding shall be provided for each unit, which collapses easily without tools to allow hand-carrying into the field.  This stand shall allow tool-free setup, attachment and removal of the analyzer.  A backscatter shield for the analyzer shall be provided for each unit to reduce exposure to backscattered x-rays when using in handheld operation.
Each analyzer shall include preprogrammed modes of operation for the determination of lead and other RoHS elements in metals and in plastics and a mode for user-definable calibrations and analyses.  Calibration standards shall include a minimum of 1 alloy standard and 1 plastic standard reference material for calibration check.

Units must be delivered no later than four weeks after receipt of an order by the vendor.  

Only written quotes will be accepted.  In response to this notice, quoters must submit pricing:  Analyzer:  CLIN 0001 9/24/07 - 9/23/08, CLIN 0001a price per unit, CLIN 0001b onsite training, CLIN 0002 9/24/08 - 9/23/09, CLIN 0002a price per unit, CLIN 0002b onsite training, CLIN 0003 9/24/09 - 9/23/10, CLIN 0003a price per unit, CLIN 0003b onsite training, CLIN 0004 9/24/10 - 9/23/11, CLIN 0004a price per unit, CLIN 0004b onsite training,  CLIN 0005 9/24/11 - 9/23/12, CLIN 0005a price per unit, CLIN 0005b onsite training.

Any vendor quoting an alternative product must provide complete supporting documentation the that product is equal to the brand name identified and that it meets all minimum essential characteristics cited above, in particular adequate KeV to excite 37.1 KeV emission peak from Neodymium.  This requirement is mandatory because rare-earth magnets must be detected, which are typically made from neodymium with an electroplated coating of durable, attractive metals, such as copper, nickel, zinc, chromium, etc.    While it is possible to excite a lower energy emission line for neodymium with a lower power tube, the fact that these magnets are typically coated with metals such as copper, nickel, chromium, zinc, and others for durability and appearance may shield such emissions from being detected.  Failure to provide supporting technical  documentation will make the quoter ineligible for award.  Quoters must identify the location of equipment manufacture.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the following address: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 Second Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, DC  20593, and Phone: (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their 
concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    

The reference number NHLBI-PB(HL)-2007-247-DDC. 

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular  2005-19. 


This requirement is being conducted as a full and open competitive, with no set aside restrictions. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 423450 and the associated small business size is 100 employees.

The Government?s estimated expected delivery date is sixty calendar days after receipt of the purchase order.

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.  The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $5 million.  


The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions OA, DERA intends intend to award a single, fixed priced purchase order for the purchase of a Liquid Chromatography System for Protein Purification, medical equipment as outlined below.  

The specifications of Liquid Chromatography System for Protein Purification are as follows: 
The Government requires the ability to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials derived from cell lysates, tissue homogenates, recombinant protein expression systems and other sources.  The desire system required must be able to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity.

The Government may want to automate the running of large, open columns on the system, as well as a variety of gel filtration media, and require a flow rate range of .05-20mls/min at pressures ranging from 0-700 psi.

Since the Government requires resolution that may necessitate the use of very precise, shallow gradients, the system must be a two-pump gradient system, with dynamic mixing, as evidence suggests that this configuration produces the highest accuracy and precision in gradient formation.

The Government intends to use salt buffers, and the entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides. The system pumps should allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low pressure chromatography supports often used in affinity chromatography and other techniques.

The controller must allow programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based, and must allow user intervention of a running method (e.g., change of a flow rate) without stopping or pausing the run. This allows the user to overcome unforeseen problems without sacrificing or compromising the sample purification.

The system must include a fraction collector which is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software.

In order to facilitate cleaning, storage, selections of our various chromatographic columns, and further automation the system must have the ability to control nine motorized valves, and it is necessary for column selection, buffer selection, flow reversals, multi-dimensional chromatography, etc.  Also, these motorized valves should provide feedback to the control system to ensure proper orientation of all valves, and documentation of valve positions at all times.  The valves should be driven electronically and require no external air or pressure to operate.

The system controller must allow the user to be entering details of the next purification at the same time the current separation is being done, or to simultaneously be integrating and evaluating the results of earlier runs.

Control of up to nine motorized valves, chart recorders, fraction collectors, dynamic gradient mixers, air sensors, and three pumps, must all be possible from the system controller.

The pumps, UV and conductivity monitors, valves and fraction collectors must all be specified for use in a cold room at 4 degrees C.

The controller must accept seven input signals (e.g.,  UV wavelengths, conductivity, pH, temperatures, pressure).  It must be capable of plotting, and integrating these signals, as well as using them to trigger sub-routines in the programming when the signal exceeds a preset threshold, to allow the automation of multi-dimensional separations.

The system must include one automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, and wash positions), which will allow for sample loading onto the column.

The system controller should allow for automation of the optimization of separation parameters (e.g., sample volume, flow rates, gradient slope).  This should allow a small amount of the sample to be consumed in optimizing the purification scheme, after which the best regime can be scaled up on the same LC system.

Column equilibration before and after sample injection and elution must be capable of being monitored, with a feed-back loop to the control system, and the Government will have no doubt the equilibration is completed, without consuming excess volume of sometimes expensive buffers.

Documentation of each run should be automatic and exhaustive, so that for purposes of subsequent replication and eventual publication, no detail is left unrecorded.

Post-run chromatographic analysis and reporting functions should also be included.

In order to protect the columns, the system must have a definable pressure limit system, which will stop the pump and generate an audible and visual warning, in the event pressure exceeds the preset limit.  The government also require that the controller allow the user the option of including in his/her chromatographic methods programs, commands which will automatically reduce the flow rate if over-pressurization occurs as sample is being applied or eluted from the column. Additional variables which should also be programmable to trigger subroutines (e.g., a new tube on fraction collector, valve changes, etc.) should include UV or conductivity signals.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 12, utilizing FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This announcement constitutes the synopsis; proposals are being requested electronically to Mr. Raymond Hawkins, Jr., hawkinsra@mail.nih.gov, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) under NLM-07-230/RSH.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 ? ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL MANAGEMENT CONSULTING SERVICES.

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure services for the planning and gathering of two meetings: (1) A workshop to identify ?policy resistant public health problems? relevant to the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) mission and prioritize them; and, (2) a two day meeting of leaders in the field to formulate new research questions, directions, perhaps a new grid or paradigms for the next generation of health disparities research all on behalf of the National Institutes of Health.  

Title:  Concept Mapping Projects to Address Policy Resistant Public Health Problems.

1) Policy-Resistant Public Health Problems

This project is to identify areas that are considered or have been observed to be ?policy-resistant? and will be led by Dr. Patricia Mabry at OBSSR.  This is a collaborative effort between OBSSR and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The desired end point of the concept mapping project for this focus shall be the delivery of presentation ready materials by November 2, 2007 for the Expert Panel meeting to be held on November 15 - 16, 2007 in Washington, DC.  A final report of the project shall be delivered following this meeting and in the second week of December, 2007. 

Project Specifics: 

?	Participants for brainstorming, sorting, and rating will be drawn from OBSSR and CDC list serves and the email distribution lists of other professional organizations.  The process of identifying participants has already begun.

?	Respondent questions will depend on the Working Group?s interest in sub-group comparisons, and will be defined prior to sorting and rating.

?	Rating scales will also be determined according to the Working Group?s interest in value comparisons, and will be defined after the brainstorming is underway.  

?	Products will include preliminary results, final results, a full presentation in electronic and hard copy format in advance of the Expert Panel workshop, Expert Panel web or teleconference briefings, and a final summary report of the concept mapping activities and results. 

Planning and Project Management:  Vendor shall be responsible for managing timelines, harmonizing communication approaches with those of OBSSR, and ensuring that OBSSR has the information it needs to make project related decisions.  Although some travel will be required at key points, the project requires a routine schedule of planning conference calls, to begin within a week after the contract is awarded.  This provides a cost-effective and time-sensitive way for the project to proceed in the time required.

Working Group:  The Working Group for this project will include Dr. Mabry and Dr. Milstein, as well as other OBSSR senior staff assigned to this project.  It will also include two of the vendor?s senior staff and one project manager. Vendor will be responsible for the timely and complete fulfillment of each activity in the planned scope of work.    

Responses to the focus prompt will enable the Office to clearly delineate these areas, and identify priorities among them, for strategic, systemic change.  Thus, the focus prompt is critical to ensuring that the feedback from the invited experts will be on target with the Office?s needs.  The focus prompt will be drafted, piloted and finalized as soon as is practicable, in collaboration with the Office and the project Working Group.  

Determining Rating Scales and Respondent Questions:  With vendor guidance, the Working Group will determine the most useful rating scales for the purposes of this project.   They will also develop the respondent questions that they expect would yield the most useful opportunities for comparison of participant subgroups.

Communicating with Meeting Attendees to participate in pre-meeting activities:   Taking into account the Office?s interest in holding the expert workshop on November 15- 16, 2007, the OBSSR project team will have drafts of invitations or ?save the date? communications to send to the invitees in fairly short order if deemed necessary or appropriate.  OBSSR will connect the communication needs of the concept mapping activities to those communications that the OBSSR has planned regarding the late fall meeting, harmonizing messages and timing to ensure that the invitees have sufficient notice and encouragement to participate.  Vendor shall be responsible for participation reminders over the duration of the concept mapping activities themselves.

Designing and Managing Websites for Participation:    Vendor shall be responsible for ensuring that the Working Group is satisfied with the specifics of the project design, including the focus prompt and timeline for participation.  Vendor shall design, host, monitor and manage global websites that will be customized for this project, and will communicate regarding timeframes for participation at each stage.

Conducting Brainstorming:  Vendor will host the customized website for stakeholders to contribute specific responses to the focus prompt.  

Post-Brainstorming Synthesis:  Prior to issuing a request for sorting and rating, vendor shall work with the Working Group to review, edit and render consistent and usable the set of unique ideas that will have emerged from the brainstorming.  

Conducting Sorting and Rating:  Vendor shall host unique sites for these activities.  It is common practice to identify a smaller number of invitees to take part in the sorting activity.  The Working Group will indentify and invite a subset of about 40 - 50 people from the brainstorming group to complete the sorting activities.  All who were invited to brainstorm will also be invited to rate.  

Analysis and Results Development:  Vendor shall conduct all the necessary analyses and develop preliminary results for review and editing by the Working Group.  Vendor shall edit and convey revisions of the preliminary analysis to the Working group for final approval in advance of the expert workshop. 

Final Presentation at the Expert Panel Meeting:  Vendor shall prepare all final concept mapping related materials for distribution at the meeting.  Vendor will support the Office?s development of the Expert Panel meeting agenda, to the degree that the concept mapping results will help to frame a purposeful focus on the areas of interest to the assembled group and to OBSSR.

2) Health Disparities

In this portion of the project, OBSSR is interested in identifying issues or targeted areas of concentration that relate the fact of health disparities to social and behavioral issues.  Dr. Stephane Philogene assisted by other OBSSR staff and contractors will lead this initiative.  The desired end point of the concept mapping project for this focus will be the presentation of results at a meeting on health disparities and social and behavioral sciences.  This meeting will be held in late January 2008.

Project Specifics: 

?	The identification of meeting invitees will clearly guide the development of the participant list for this effort.  We anticipate that participants will number about 100 for brainstorming and rating.  We anticipate between 40 and 50 of these to be invited to sort as well.

?	Respondent questions will depend on the Working Group?s interest in sub-group comparisons, and will be defined prior to sorting and rating.

?	Rating scales will also be determined according to the Working Group?s interest in value comparisons, and will be defined after the brainstorming is underway.  

?	Products will include preliminary results, final results, a full presentation in electronic and hard copy format in advance of the expert workshop, and a final summary report of the concept mapping activities and results. 

Planning and Project Management:  Vendor shall be responsible for managing timelines, harmonizing communication approaches with those of OBSSR, and ensuring that OBSSR has the information it needs to make project related decisions.  Although some travel will be required at key points, the project requires a routine schedule of planning conference calls, to begin within a week after the contract is awarded.  This provides a cost-effective and time-sensitive way for the project to proceed in the time required.

Working Group:  The Working Group for this project will include Dr. Philogene and other OBSSR staff and contractors as designated. It will also include two of the vendor?s senior staff and one project manager.  The Working Group will be responsible for the timely and complete fulfillment of each activity in the planned scope of work.  

Participants in the concept mapping activities:  Participants will include policy experts, academic researchers, government representatives and other officials as identified by OBSSR.  

Target participation for each project phase is as follows:
?	Brainstorming:  up to 200 participants
?	Sorting:  up to 50 participants
?	Rating:  up to 200 participants

Focus prompt:  The objectives of this concept mapping project are to develop a collaborative, knowledge-based framework of the issues of health disparities in relation to behavioral and social science.  Responses to the focus prompt will enable the Office to identify priorities for research support in these areas. The proposed focus prompt is the following:

What breakthrough research is needed to eliminate disparities in health?

Determining Rating Scales and Respondent Questions:  The Working Group will determine the rating foci and scales that would be most useful for the purposes of this project.  They will also consider what respondent questions they expect would yield the most useful opportunities for comparison of subgroups of participants.  

Communicating with Meeting Attendees to participate in pre-meeting activities:   Taking into account the Office?s interest in holding the expert workshop no later than mid-February 2008, the OBSSR project team will likely have drafts of invitations or ?save the date? communications to send to the invitees in fairly short order.  OBSSR will connect the communication needs of the concept mapping activities to those communications that the OBSSR has planned regarding the winter 2008 meeting, harmonizing messages and timing to ensure that the invitees have sufficient notice and encouragement to participate.  In addition, vendor shall be responsible for participation reminders over the duration of the concept mapping activities themselves.

Designing and Managing Websites for Participation:    Vendor is responsible for ensuring that the Working Group is satisfied with the specifics of the project design, including the focus prompt and timeline for participation.  Vendor shall design, host, monitor and manage global websites that will be customized for this project, and will communicate regarding timeframes for participation at each stage.

Conducting Brainstorming:  Vendor shall host the customized website for meeting attendees to contribute specific responses to the focus prompt.  

Post-Brainstorming Synthesis:  Prior to a request for sorting and rating, Vendor shall work with the Working Group to review, edit and render consistent and usable the set of unique ideas that will have emerged from the brainstorming. 

Conducting Sorting and Rating:  Vendor shall host unique sites for these activities.  It is common practice to identify a smaller number of invitees to take part in the sorting activity.  Participants for the sorting activity will be identified by the Working Group from the list of all expert workshop invitees.  All who were invited to brainstorm will also be invited to rate.

Analysis and Results Development:  Vendor will conduct all the necessary analyses and develop preliminary results for review and editing by the Working Group.  Vendor shall edit and convey to the Working group for final approval in advance of the expert workshop. 

Final Presentation at the Expert Workshop:  Vendor shall prepare all concept mapping related materials for distribution at the meeting, and shall conduct the final presentation.  If it is determined necessary by OBSSR, Vendor shall support the Office?s development of the expert meeting/summit agenda, to the degree that the concept mapping results will help to frame a purposeful focus on the areas of interest to the assembled group and to OBSSR.

Travel:  In support of this project, OBSSR anticipates two planning meetings that will take place at the OBSSR offices in Bethesda.  These meetings will coincide with milestones in the project, and will be necessary for the timely completion of each deliverable and decision step.  Vendor may be required to attend the expert meeting/summit in California to present the results of the project and assist as appropriate.  The project officer will decide and approve any required travel.

Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.

Title: Native American Listening Circles Project

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure services for the development of a healthy tribal community in part through outreach assistance to a tribal information technology company (in this case, the Ft. Berthold Indian Reservation, home to the MHA Nation?Mandan-Hidatsa-Arikara, also known as Three Affiliated Tribes) that would ultimately result in jobs creation on the reservation on behalf of the National Institutes of Health.  
 
Given the high unemployment rates on Indian reservations, the National Congress of American Indians recognizes job creation as one of the top priorities for addressing the underlying causes of many tribal health issues.

To achieve the primary purpose of tribal economic development, the project includes tasks that address several main components of successful small business development?effective planning and scheduling; strong technical infrastructure (hardware and software); well trained management and staff; proven track record in core business; well tested and accurate pricing models; and reliable reporting and accountability.  The tasks as a whole are intended to improve the competitive capabilities and posture of the vendor and also to refine, test, and strengthen the company?s core scanning and document conversion services (through scanning and converting materials provided by or through NLM).

The overall goal is to expand and strengthen the core business and document conversion capabilities of MHA Systems Inc., and thereby contribute to the long-term economic viability of the company and its ability to provide jobs for tribal members of the MHA Nation.

SCOPE OF WORK:

	The contractor will:

?	TASK 1.  Prepare Detailed Project Plan and Schedule.  
This will include comprehensive consideration of options for use of the project budget for equipment, training, web site, and other investments in MHA Systems Inc. that would be expected to further enhance the competitiveness of the company in the scanning and related document conversion markets, and the general overall corporate competitiveness and thereby the ability of the company to create jobs for tribal members of the MHA Nation.  This also will include a detailed plan, including cost and pricing estimates, for scanning and converting materials to be provided by or through NLM, to be developed in consultation with NLM.   This will include final revised cost and pricing estimates for the AIDS abstract document conversion work itemized in Tasks 6, 7, and 8 in this SOW.  Also, the plan should include a schedule for incremental deliverables for Tasks 6, 7, and 8, with the first increment a pilot deliverable of approximately 100 converted AIDS abstracts.  This will allow an early opportunity for QA problem detection and resolution.  The size of the incremental deliveries should be consistent with a balanced and orderly work flow at MHA Systems Inc. and QA review by the Task Manager and NLM.
 
?	TASK 2.  Purchase Hardware and Software Upgrades for MHA Systems Inc.
This will include the purchase of the additional hardware and software identified in TASK 1 that would optimize the competitive posture of MHA Systems Inc. in carrying out the document conversion work assigned in this contract and in related work.  This equipment will supplement and complement the equipment provided in Phases I, II, and III, and will be prioritized to support the document conversion work specified in Tasks 5, 6, 7, and 8 of this SOW.

?	TASK 3.  Arrange Additional Professional Training for MHA Systems Inc. Staff.  
This will include the arranging of select additional training courses and classes for MHA Systems staff and management, with a general goal of increasing the technical and management skills of staff, so as to further enhance the overall capacity and competitive posture of MHA Systems Inc.  This additional training will supplement and complement the training provided in Phases I, II, and III, and will be prioritized to support the document conversion work specified in Tasks 5, 6, 7, and 8 of this SOW.

?	TASK 4.  Commission MHA Systems Web Site and Related Promotional Upgrades.  
This will include further upgrades to the MHA Systems corporate Web site and related promotional brochures and information pieces.  This may include exhibiting at high impact industry trade shows.

?	TASK 5.  Scanning Pilot Study Phase IV, Part 1.  
This will include the scanning by MHA Systems Inc. of additional materials provided by or through NLM.  The nature, scanning/conversion specifications, and volume of these materials will be determined in consultation with NLM as part of developing the detailed project plan.

?	TASK 6.  AIDS Abstract Document Conversion Part 1.  
This will include the document conversion of the first group of AIDS abstracts, TBD, with exact pricing and schedule TBD (based on Task 1 results).   As with Task 5, the nature, scanning and conversion specifications, and volume of these materials will be determined in consultation with NLM as part of developing the detailed project plan.  The AIDS abstracts will be similar to the samples provided to MHA Systems Inc.  All document conversion will conform to the bibliographic, DTD, and XML standards provided by NLM, including the NLM Library Operations Division, Bibliographic Services Division.  Technical oversight and quality assurance of work product will be conducted by the Task Manager or his/her designee.

NOTE:  For all AIDS Abstract Document Conversion Tasks (including Tasks 6, 7, and 8 in the current SOW), the contractor will carry out the following specific task elements:

1) Analyze print volume / CD-ROM to identify which portions of the AIDS conference/meeting proceedings would be used;
2) In the case of CD-ROM products, printing of each abstract for conversion;
3) Analyze the bibliographic citations and abstract set up. Set up style sheet/instructions for doing the conversion;
4) Conversion of the citations and abstracts to the meeting abstract XML format (scanning / OCR component);
5) QA of conversion to produce XML file that validates against the Meetings Abstract DTD;
6) Delivery of the XML file and return of the original Print or CD-ROM product (original material must be returned in order, though not necessarily in a bound form);
7) Responding to Task Manager and NLM QA evaluation, including NLM Library Operations Division, Bibliographic Services Division, and Medlars Management Section.

These are the overall tasks that the contractor is expected to handle.  The materials to be converted are primarily either in bound paper format or on CD-ROM; there are 4 conferences in PDF format, but they can be handled similarly to the CD-ROM material.  The paper versions must be returned to NLM in order, though not necessarily in bound form.  In most cases, we only have one copy of the conference proceedings and must have the original to use for our QA process.  For the CD-ROM volumes, the CD must be returned.  We also assume that the vendor is most likely going to need to print out the abstracts and then do the scanning/OCR work.

?	TASK 7.   AIDS Abstract Document Conversion Part 2.   
This will include the document conversion of the second group of AIDS abstracts, TBD, with exact pricing and schedule TBD (based on Task 1 results).   As with Task 5, the nature, scanning and conversion specifications, and volume of these materials will be determined in consultation with NLM as part of developing the detailed project plan.  The AIDS abstracts will be similar to the samples provided to MHA Systems Inc.  All document conversion will conform to the bibliographic, DTD, and XML standards provided by NLM, including the NLM Library Operations Division, Bibliographic Services Division.  Technical oversight and quality assurance of work product will be conducted by the Task Manager or his/her designee.

?	TASK 8.   AIDS Abstract Document Conversion Part 3.   
This will include the document conversion of the third group of AIDS abstracts, TBD, with exact pricing and schedule TBD (based on Task 1 results).   As with Task 5, the nature, scanning and conversion specifications, and volume of these materials will be determined in consultation with NLM as part of developing the detailed project plan.  The AIDS abstracts will be similar to the samples provided to MHA Systems Inc.  All document conversion will conform to the bibliographic, DTD, and XML standards provided by NLM, including the NLM Library Operations Division, Bibliographic Services Division.  Technical oversight and quality assurance of work product will be conducted by the Task Manager or his/her designee.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-07-10897, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ)using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-20.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $11.0 to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for Plasma Peptide or Protein Identification Services.  BACKGROUND. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Gulf Ecology Division is developing protein biomarker techniques to detect adverse effects in aquatic animals, and applying such biomarkers to screen chemicals for mode of action (MOA) specific effects.  To accomplish this, fish are exposed to a model compound(s) representative of a specific MOA, such as estrogenic activity, and a comparison is made between plasma (or other tissue) protein expression of control fish and treated fish.  Tissue/plasma protein biomarkers of a specific MOA are discovered using either  low resolution surface-enhanced-laser-desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (SELDI) or matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI).  These two types of mass spectrometry provide protein/peptide molecular mass and relative abundance information, but do not necessarily provide protein/peptide identification. OBJECTIVE.  The purpose of this contract is to secure services to provide identification and/or amino acid sequences of peptide/protein biomarker candidates which have been targeted from protein expression profiles generated using a Ciphergen ProteinChip instrument (in either SELDI or MALDI mode). The contractor shall provide all  personnel, facilities, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, transportation, supervision and services necessary for the identification of target  tissue/plasma peptides/proteins of interest in samples (primarily from fish) supplied by the government. TASK DESCRIPTION. The services to be provided by the contractor are all procedures needed to identify target peptides/proteins in gel, tissue or solution samples provided by the EPA.

This procurement is to enter into a contract with a qualified vendor. and is needed for HUD?s Strategic Plan, FHA loan performance analysis and loan scoring responsibilities.  The data are also needed for the new Single Family Insurance Reform Initiatives.  The Request is to exercise a Base Period of 1 year with 2 option Periods.
HUD seeks access to a comprehensive mortgage securities database?a giant repository that has tracked collateral default, prepayment and credit risk since 1995 and includes:
?	Over 90% of the outstanding jumbo mortgage pools 
?	Over 85% of the asset-backed securities (ABS) market 
?	Loan-level data on over 8,500 active private-issue securities 
Using this information, HUD users will analyze and evaluate portfolios, mine data and depict it graphically, identify undesirable collateral, and create automatically updated reports.  The securities mortgage loan database should provides state-of-the-art online mortgage portfolio analysis, evaluation, and benchmarking?effortlessly combining terabytes of mortgage data with blazingly fast analytics and reporting. The securities mortgage loan should be built on the latest MicroStrategy 8.0 platform (HUD standard), and utilize high-performance business intelligence and reporting tools employ anytime-anywhere access to the largest loan-level securities database in the industry.
	 The procurement is an annual subscription of commercially available mortgage databases accessible on the Internet and all data are currently accessible in an ABS (ALT-A & Nonprime) database.  The asset-backed securities database should provide loan-level mortgage data on a minimum of 6,000 home equity and nonprime loan pools (5,600 active) that include 14.9 million loans (6.3 million active) with $1.193 trillion in outstanding balances.  The securities mortgage loan database should provide a unique 15-year perspective on the non-Agency securities market. This extended view?one enabling long-term projections that account for historical market fluctuations?ensures a degree of accuracy simply not possible with briefer time horizons.

II. BACKGROUND
Apart from its involvement in single family and multifamily risk assessment and risk scoring, the Office of Evaluation (OE), located in the Office of Finance and Budget in the Office of Housing, is responsible for monitoring the performance of FHA?s single family and multifamily programs.  It prepares periodic reports to the FHA Commissioner on FHA business activities and oversees the statutorily mandated annual actuarial review of FHA?s largest insurance fund.   OE is also responsible for assessing the financial impact on FHA?s insurance funds of new or revised programs and policies and evaluating relationships between current economic and market conditions and FHA program goals and objectives.

With the advent of credit reform, the OE has become responsible for developing, maintaining, and updating cash flow models used to estimate credit subsidy rates for FHA?s budget and liability for loan guarantee for FHA?s annual financial statement.  These cash flow models use historical data for loans grouped into risk categories to calculate the net present value of cash flows over the life of a book of business.  Cash flows are estimated for premiums, claims, and recoveries.  A credit subsidy rate for each risk category is calculated by dividing the net present value of cash flows by projected endorsements.  If the credit subsidy rate is positive, FHA needs appropriations of credit subsidy (as well as commitment authority) before it can endorse new loans.  

The procurement is an annual subscription of commercially available mortgage databases accessible on the Internet and all data are currently accessible in a current Alt-A & Nonprime database.  The asset-backed securities database should provide loan-level mortgage data on 7,000 home equity and nonprime loan pools (6,000 active) that include 14.9 million loans (6.3 million active) with $1.193 trillion in outstanding balances.  The securities databases provide a unique 15-year perspective on the non-Agency securities market. This extended view?one enabling long-term projections that account for historical market fluctuations?ensures a degree of accuracy simply not possible with briefer time horizons.

This database assistance will allow 1) superior single family risk assessments and 2) more program and related data available to program managers to help improve program performance, hold down costs, and increase the effectiveness with which HUD can maintain and increase the supply of affordable housing.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Replacement of Cisco Network Equipment
<SOLNBR>DCAA-C07-185(7-041)
<RESPDATE>092307
<ARCHDATE>10082007
<CONTACT>Peter Joyce, Contract Specialist, Phone 614-693-1951, Fax null, Email peter.joyce@dfas.mil
<DESC>Per FAR Part 5, the J&A for this solicitation is hereby posted.

Contracting Activity: DFAS-CSD/HCMCOA
MIPR/Local Identification Number: HA7DFASMIPR041/DCAA-C07-185-001
Program Name (and Cost Element if Applicable):  Cisco Purchase & Trade-In, Network Eq.
Estimated Contract Cost: $967,748.19
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(c)
Type J&A: Individual


JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN
FULL & OPEN COMPETITION

I.	Contracting Organization

The Defense Contract Audit Agency, Administrative Management Division, Fort Belvoir, Virginia has submitted a requirement for purchase to DFAS CSD/HCMCOA (Columbus, Ohio).  This requirement is submitted, justified for other than full and open competition based on brand name applicability.  The product in place is Cisco and componentry must be compatible.  The MIPR number is HA7DFASMIPR041 and the DCAA ARN Number is DCAA-C07-185-001.

II.	Description of Action

This action will be awarded as a new contract.  The action provides for a trade-in of some parts that reduces the overall cost.  The estimated cost includes the trade-in value.  This will be a firm fixed price action that will include a pre-determined trade-in allowance. This action is not subject to unusual or compelling urgency.   This is an individual, not a class J&A.  A list of items to be purchased is included as Attachment #1.  A list of trade-in items is included as Attachment #2. 

III.	Description of Supplies/Services

The products being acquired are a combination of new equipment that is required in preparation for the FTS 2001 telecommunications contract transition to the Networx telecommunications contract in FY 08, and the replacement of current systems hardware that are no longer under warranty and have become obsolete. The list of equipment is contained in Atch #1.  The former group of items is listed under Items 0022-0032, 0046-0069, and 0080-0082, while the latter group of items is listed under Items 0001-0021, 0033-0045, 0070-0079, and 0083-0113.  

DCAA is reengineering its WAN in order to be in a position to obtain services off the Networx contract. Since the telecommunications contract is transitioning from FTS 2001 to Networx, DCAA is forced to rework a portion of its communications infrastructure hardware in order to be compatible with the new telecommunications contract services to ensure there is no breakdown in our WAN support Agency-wide.  The current structure will only support frame relay.  This rework/reengineering of communications hardware infrastructure will enable DCAA to go from the current frame relay to a frame relay over IP solution, and eventually to a total IP solution as the new routers will support multiple solutions.

Approval for only one (1) fiscal year is required.  A similar type of acquisition for Cisco equipment was undertaken on contract HQ0422-06-F-6011.  That contract covered the purchase (and trade-in) of a group of 12 Cisco parts for the purpose of upgrading what was the current WAN system hardware.  The present acquisition will be competed among Cisco distributors.

IV.	Authority

10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(c)

V.	Applicability of Authority

As the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) continues its various enterprise initiatives, one core theme is increasingly applied to the organization?s operational direction.  That theme is to face the increasing demand to ?do more with less?, thereby reducing costs.  To warrant the ability to meet that demand, emphasis is placed on using like branded tools and components to ease the burden of monitoring and maintaining its devices, placing talented areas of expertise at a central location, and ensuring that organizational oversight is enabled.  

	DCAA has made significant investments in its Wide Area Network (DCAA WAN), and the components that comprise its infrastructure architecture environment.  This infrastructure investment has been totally within Cisco?s product line. DCAA has sought to compound the return on the DCAA WAN investment by taking advantage of use of similar components within the infrastructure.  DCAA has invested considerable resources in CiscoWorks (Cisco?s firewall, router and switch management software) in order to centralize the updating/upgrading, vulnerability mitigation, and troubleshooting of our over 600 Cisco WAN/LAN components.  

	Standardization on Cisco products at the DCAA HQ and into the enterprise reduces infrastructure complexity.  It also reduces training costs by minimizing the types and brands of infrastructure gear and tools that technicians must be familiar with to effectively maintain the network.  Furthermore, standardization across the enterprise enables technicians at one location to assist and trouble shoot problematic areas at other locations or fill voids where needs dictate.  Identifying and/or avoiding issues of a problematic nature, or achieving expedient problem resolutions where necessary, increases DCAA?s ability to support its users in the CONUS as well as Europe, Iraq, Korea, Russia, and other areas of the world.

	Taking these steps affords DCAA the opportunity to anticipate and better control its costs as it relates to managing its infrastructure devices, applying fixes, patches, and upgrades where required.  Additionally, steps taken by this implementation allow DCAA to reduce device administration training and pre-position for future streamlining and enterprise management consolidation efforts.

VI.	Efforts to Obtain Competition

In order to increase potential competition, this action will be synopsized per FAR part 5.  Specifically, it will be synopsized per Brand Name requirements of FAR part 5.102(a)(6).  The purchase of Cisco equipment is necessary due to compatibility needs based on the previous investment in infrastructure at DCAA using Cisco.  Qualifying country sourcing is not an issue under this action.  

VII.	Fair and Reasonable Costs

Products offered will be commercial products.  The anticipated costs will be considered fair and reasonable based on the anticipation of distributor competition and because the basis of offers with be based on schedules held by the likely offerors.  Generally, schedule awards, such as those under GSA are competed prior to award.  FAR guidelines advise under FAR 8.404 that GSA has already determined GSA pricing of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable.  As more schedules are put into place under such vehicles as SEWP, ESI and others, many of these same guidelines are utilized.   

VIII.	Market Research

Market research was conducted by DCAA.  Quotes provided in response to this action and a summary of quotes were provided by DCAA with the procurement package.  As noted under VI, the pursuit of alternate equipment is not possible under this action due to the action being a replacement/upgrade of existing Cisco equipment.  The market survey responses indicated there are sources available and capable of satisfying DCAA?s requirements.  Commercial items will be procured under this action.  Based on the focus of this project and results from the market survey, no other sources exist for this action other than Cisco or its distributors.  

IX.	Other Facts

Data packages for full & open competition have not been developed because while the product needed is commercial, the previous investment in infrastructure and existing compatibility needs preclude use of other than Cisco product.  The order must be issued on a limited-source basis as DCAA has standardized the Agency?s network on Cisco equipment.  In addition, all IT contractors are required by DCAA to have Cisco certified credentials.  To acquire another product would be cost prohibitive due to the additional expense associated with acquiring other credentials.

<DESC>*** Questions and Answers*** Quotes due back 17 Sept 07 by 1200 (Noon).

**Questions**

CLIN # 6 - The angle broom already has a hydr angle with it - what are they talking about?? 
CLIN #5 - 14 Pin Conversion Kit - do they want a 14 Pin Attachment Control Kit to be installed on their S300 to accommodate older attachments? 
CLIN #3 - Factory installed faster flat faxed couplers than the flushed faced couplers that come with the attachment to match up to their S300?  I would have thought the S300 would have the flushed faced couplers on it already, or did they switch out the couplers on their loader and need different couplers on the attachment now? 

**Answers**

1. CLIN#0006 - Don't worry about the hydr angle. Removed from requirement.
 
2. CLIN#0005 - 14 pin conversion kit....I believe they are talking about the electrical connection that makes the broom work.  We already have that on our bobcats. Removed from requirement.
 
3. CLIN#0003 -  We have the flushed face connectors on our bobcats already.  Removed from requirement.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Amendment A001:  To meet the requirements of FAR 11.105 and 5.102(a)(6), the Justification for purchase of items peculiar to one manufacturer is provided.  This Justification as posted does not include signature pages, however, the executed Justification is available at http://www.uscg.mil/hq/arsc/contracting/EISD/pso.htm along with the solicitation.  The Closing Date and Time for receipt of offers is not extended.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
HSCG38-07-R-500022

Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3 and in accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows:

      (1)  Agency and Contracting Activity -  U.S. Coast Guard, Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Engineering Support  Division, Contracting Section, Elizabeth City, North Carolina   proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition.

(2)  Nature and/or description of the action being approved. ?   Approval is requested to procure, on a limited source basis, a variety of Ground Support Equipment (GSE) spare parts for use on the HH65 aircraft fleet .  These are commercial items and will be procured utilizing the procedures in FAR Part 12 combined with FAR Part 13.5.   The proposed contract type is a Firm-Fixed Price contract.   The estimated cost of this acquisition is $698,000.00  It is anticipated more than one award may result from the solicitation.  
  
(3)  Description of Supplies/Services  -  The requirement is to provide the CGAS Hitron Jacksonville HH65 aircraft peculiar support/maintenance equipment for initial provisioning in support of Coast Guard aircraft maintenance.  As the Aviation Inventory Control Point (AICP), ARSC must provide effective supply support for all Coast Guard aviation units and for the Programmed Depot Maintenance Program.  This requirement is to be awarded to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) North American subsidiary or a responsible source that has access to OEM parts and can provide documented traceability back to the OEM.  The material and estimated quantities to be procured are based on current and past usage data.  Stocking levels projected are based on experienced mean time between failure rate, failure and corrosion trends, experienced and projected scrap rates, and procurement lead times.    

The estimated total value of this procurement action is $698,000 for fifty-eight (58) Line Items (See Attachment A).
     
 (4)  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition   
 The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 
10 USC 2304(c)(1) implement by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled ?Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements?.

     (5)  Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Require Use of the Authority Cited.  The material to be procured is manufactured by a foreign manufacturer, Eurocopter S.A.S., Aeroport International, De Marseille-Province, 13725 Margnane Cedex. France.  Eurocopter, France is also the manufacturer of the USCG HH-65 aircraft.  Eurocopter , France sole designed, developed and produced the equipment and its technical requirements for 



maintenance and support equipment used in the HH-65 maintenance effort.   Eurocopter, France owns all rights to proprietary data, specifications and drawings. The US Coast Guard does not own, or have data rights for this peculiar support equipment.  
 
American Eurocopter LLC, 2701 Form Drive, Grand Prairie, Texas is the manufacturer's North American subsidiary and provides distribution of Eurocopter S.A.S. France products, services and fleet support.  There are, however, U.S. affiliates and distributors who may be able to propose on one or more of the parts to be procured.  For aircraft operational safety, the part numbers listed in these requirements are the only part numbers approved for use on the HH65  aircraft.  This prohibits consideration of a part number manufactured by other companies within the U.S. or from foreign vendors other than the OEM.    

    (6)  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  ? A combined snyopsis/solicitation for this requirement will be submitted to FedBizOpps for potential offerors.  If any responses are received as a result of the solicitation, the file will be documented accordingly and the requirement competed among all eligible offerors.

    (7)  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.  - The contracting officer determines that the anticipated prices will be fair and reasonable based on   comparison with historical pricing, comparison to market prices for similar items, commercial catalog prices and the Government estimate.

    (8)  Description of Market Research. ? Market surveys are continually conducted to identify new sources of supply for the HH65 spare parts.  In addition to American Eurocopter, LLC (the approved foreign manufacturer's distributor) other brokers and/or vendors in the past have provided a limited quantity Eurocopter S.A.S., France parts.  These firms are Sey Tech, Inc., Hurst, TX and Boone Air Parts, Valencia CA.  The items to be procured meet the commercial item definition and many of the parts are listed in American Eurocopter, LLC's 2007 commercial catalog.

    (9)  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition. -  Since the U.S. Coast Guard did not purchase the technical rights as part of the original acquisition for the HH65 aircraft and the necessary manufacturing drawings, data and special tooling information is proprietary and available only to the foreign OEM, Eurocopter S.A.S., France.  Eurocopter, France will not release or provide copies drawings for the purpose of reverse engineering or to permit another manufacturer to duplicate the design(s) and remanufacture under a different part number.  Additionally, the Coast Guard has on file a letter from American Eurocopter LLC, Texas dated March 14, 2007 stating that they are the only approved source of supply for Eurocopter products for the HH65 aircraft.  They further state they are the only authorized source to sell these parts in North American and cannot be held liable, provide part 



certification documents, or provide Warranty for Eurocopter parts purchased from brokers or other vendors (See Attachment B letter from American Eurocopter LLC, Texas).
 
    (10) A Listing of the Sources, if Any, That Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.  In accordance with FAR 5.201, the intent to contract for the required items will be advertised in FedBizOpps.

    (11) A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required.  Completed specifications and technical drawings for HH65 aircraft parts and maintenance support products are not available to the Coast Guard.  However, in an effort to increase competition HH65 Product Line members annually attend aviation trade shows and performs extensive research to identify other potential sources of supply.  Procurements for Eurocopter France material are advertised in FedBizOpps.  In support of the Competition in Contracting Act, the Aircraft Repair and Supply Center established the New Product Development Branch (NPD) of which a representative is assigned to the HH65 Product Line for the purpose of identifying potential sources in the effort to remove barriers to competition.  The NPD representative has the responsibility to identify and locate alternate sources of supply/services and suitable substitute parts.  

(12)	Contracting Officer?s Certification
I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Basis for Award:

Offerors shall submit a list of current and past contracts (with points of contacts) dating back three years in which the Offerors performed similar work as to the requirement being listed by FEMA identifying whether the Offeror was a  Prime or Sub-Contractor.  FEMA will utilize the provided information to determine the Offerors? technical qualification to accomplish the required task.  The Offerors will be evaluated on:

(1)	Past Performance:  The Government will evaluate the Offeror?s, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors? and critical team members? demonstrated past performance in delivering quality products and services and in meeting technical, cost/price, and schedule requirements on similar programs; and to determine that the Offeror demonstrates the application of systemic improvement management practices and minimizing life cycle costs.  The Past Performance risk will address the probability of the Offeror successfully accomplishing the requested effort based on the relevant past performance.  Problems not addressed by the Offeror will be considered to still exist. However, consideration for discounting problems may be given when those problems are addressed through demonstrated systemic improvement.  The degree to which the Offeror can demonstrate that it has successfully applied continuous systemic improvement to resolve past performance problems will be evaluated.  Problems with no corresponding systemic improvement will be evaluated.  In the case of an Offeror without any relevant past performance of for whom the information on past performance is not available or is unknown, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably and will be assigned a rating of unknown.  

(2)	Technical Qualification: The Government will evaluate the extent and relevancy of the Offeror?s, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors? and critical team members? experience during the past three (3) years in performing the kind of work that will be required under the prospective contract and the Offeror?s ability to cope with the uncertainties and difficulties associated with that kind of work.  The Government will also evaluate the extent of relevant benefits (if any) that the Offeror gained from each contract/subcontract reference identified and how they relate to the task areas of the statement of work.  The risk will address the probability of the Offeror successfully accomplishing the requested effort based on the relevant experience.

AMENDMENT:  THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS INCLUDED IN THE STATEMENT OF WORK:

The HHS Contractor Oversight Guide provides guidance for meeting policies identified in the HHS Information Security Program Plan and requirements mandated by the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).  In addition, NIH issued Information Security Acquisition Provisions to apply in the acquisition planning process and the NIH Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) further clarified FISMA guidance and the provisions of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-07-19, FY 2007 Reporting Instructions for the Federal Information Security Management Act and Agency Privacy Management.  The FISMA requirement applies to ?information into any system which uses it or processes it on behalf of the agency.?  HHS is also responsible for implementing and administering protection of information resources in compliance with applicable public laws, Federal regulations, and Executive Orders, including the FISMA; OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Security specifications to the Statement of Work (SOW) for ensuring patient privacy and confidentiality include compliance with the provisions of ?Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information? contained within 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 160 and 164 to implement provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and associated NIH directives.  See pages 10 and 16-18 for FAR Clause requirements.

The Diabetes Division of NIDDK, as part of NIH and HHS, is responsible for managing the information and the inclusion of protected health information (patient data) requires completion of a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does not allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product support.
7.	Contractor must be knowledgeable about current health care policies regarding privacy. 

Project Deliverables
a)	Plan of Action
b)	Key processes flowchart
c)	Training resources for the staff
d)	A web based blood glucose management program that meets the objectives as specified above

Questions and Answers Re: RFQ2007-46735  (1)

Title: Use of State Laws to Permit Adolescent Consent to Vaccinations


1) Under instructions to offerors, II., the solicitation reads ?please provide a one page summary of proposed approach?? Can you tell me if this is a mandatory one page limit or if we are able to use more space to describe our approach?

ANSWER: Revised to three (3) pages for entire Technical Approach.


2)	Under instructions to offerors, III., the solicitation reads, ?please provide a CV/resume for the individual??  is it acceptable to propose more than one staff person to complete the proposed work? Our approach would be that of a team. 

ANSWER: Yes, more than one staff person is acceptable


3) Is a contractor currently working with CDC on any of this or similar work related to vaccinations?

ANSWER: No

4) It appears that the pilot surveys will be administered to more than 9 people, therefore it appears that OMB clearance will be required, even for the pilot. However, the project calendar timeline does not allow sufficient time for preparation and approval of an OMB clearance package. Does CDC have a generic survey approval applicable to this requirement? Please clarify.

ANSWER: CDC does not have a survey approval applicable to this requirement ? since it relates to vaccines

5)  Under Personnel you mention providing a resume "for the individual..."
Are you assuming only one person will be doing this work?

ANSWER: No 

6) Do you have a government estimate of the LOE for this requirement? If so, could you please provide this information.

ANSWER: We do not publicize the Government Estimate.

7)	The instructions for ?Relevant Experience? require that offerors provide the name/address and point of contact for each customer.  Inasmuch as this same information is required in offeror?s Past Performance information, please consider revising the ?Relevant Experience? requirement to eliminate this redundancy.
ANSWER: The individual with primary responsibility for validating the quality of prior performance (Item IV) may be different from the individual responsible for providing details pertaining to relevance / similarity of prior work (Item I) therefore this requirement will remain as currently stated.
8)	Item II, Technical Approach, under General Instructions states ?Please provide a one page summary of proposed approach to completing the proposed work.?  Please clarify if the technical approach is to be limited to one page or if a more detailed technical approach is required along with a one page summary.

<DESC>AMENDMENT TO TIRSE07R00004


Contractor  Question for RFP Number  TIRSE-07-R-00004



1. The Request for Proposal Number TIRSE-07-R-00004 is 100% Small Business Set-a-side.


2.  Information Mapping? is a trademarked method to write and structure information. The method has been around for more than 25 years and is one of the major influences on technical writing. 

Our design center have been using this method for our technical writing since the early 90's.  The software can be purchased and must be compatible with Microsoft Word 2003 and higher although we do not use the new Vista.  The vendor would be responsible for purchasing the software at no expense to the Government.  Most but not all of our current materials are already in this format.

For additional information see the following websites:

http://www.namahn.com/resources/documents/note-IM.pdf

3. 0009 Conversion to Spanish language ? EA refers to Each Page

4.  FAR 52.212-3, hard copy or up to date ORCA will be accepted.

5.  Yes, bidder must be a licensed Information Mapping user before contract award.

6.  A.5 Pickup and Delivery:

When the contractor delivers to the project manager, is it usually the 3 CD?s or will the contractor be required to ship hard copies?  
Normally we will accept the 3 CD delivered.  Occasionally we will request a hard copy. 

If hard copies are required, how many and how large? 
1 copy, size depends on the size of the project.

7.  Unfortunately the volume cannot be estimated, because it is based on each business unit requirements and other factors.

<DESC>This is the second modification to the combined synopsis/solicitation, W9124Q-07-R-VAULTS1, for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Questions an d answers: Q. I understand that building housing vaults will not have high security doors, but why couldnt high security door and day gate issue door be put on exterior wall? Since no weather requirement, why not use floor space for secure storage instead  of a vestibule?  A. We had requirements to provide individual storage area for each company.  The building that the armories are going into is an organizational storage warehouse for 4 companies.  Each company will have its own storage area, within the bu ilding.  Each area is physically separated.  Each company storage area is accessed by a roll-up type door to facilitate easy access to the storage area and allow access to an armory.  Floor space within each organizational area is not an issue, as it allow s plenty of room to store sensitive items other than weapons and ammunition. The changes are: This synopsis/solicitation has been extended and is due no later than 1700 hours, MST, September 14, 2007 and shall be submitted electronically to Ms. Bonnie Kern s at KERNSBJ@wsmr.army.mil.

<DESC>THIS AMENDMENT IS ISSUED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.  THE CLOSING DATE AND TIME FOR QUOTATIONS REMAINS UNCHANGED.         QUESTION 1.  The answer to Question 17 gave us the allowable leak rates for the HEPA and carbon filters. The qu estion we need to have answered is what is the allowable housing leak rate, meaning when a pressure decay test is performed on the completed housing assembly how much air can leak in or out as the case may be. This is usually expressed as either a % of rat ed air flow or as XXX CFM at XXX in. wg. pressure.            Answer:  ASME N510 Section 6 Titled Duct and housing leak test per ASME N511.  ASME N511 ties back to AG-1 for allowable leakage rate.         QUESTION 2.  The drawing for the 1200 CFM FIF has n o overall dimensions, i.e. how large is this unit?                Answer:  The M-49 housing is 50 in. wide by 24 in. high by 24 in. deep.  The pictures show two M-49 mounted one above the other.  Air flow through the filter end to end.  The winning bidder shall take possession of 14 M-49 housings to integrate into the final 5000 and 3000 CFM housings in CLIN 002.                    QUESTION 3.  As each FIF is rated for 1200 CFM and the 5000 CFM system would require five 1200 CFM systems to meet the required  residence time, what is the governments requested aspect ratio of the FIF for this system?                Answer:  The M-49 housing was nominally rated at 1200 CFM from the time it was a prototype the name has remained unchanged over the years.   Currentl y this M-49 housing and 10 filter trays are rated at 2000 CFM.  Each M-49 Tray is currently rated at 200 CFM with 10 trays per housing.  The Government is providing 8 FIF housings for integration with commercial Pre-filter and HEPA filter housings to creat e a nominal 5000 CFM CBR with redundant (in series) (HEGA)Carbon--Carbon (HEGA) gas filtration.            QUESTION 4.  As each FIF is rated for 1200 CFM and the 3000 CFM system would require three 1200 CFM systems to meet the required residence time, what  is the governments requested aspect ratio of the FIF for this system?                        Answer:  The Government is providing 4 M-49 Housings to provide redundant (in series) (HEGA)Carbon-- (HEGA) carbon gas filtration.             QUESTION 5.  Scope question regarding Section C - please confirm that the government will supply a M-49 housing and one carbon tray and that the vendor scope of work is limited to design, fabrication and testing a new door design and carbon filter clamping mechanism for exis ting M-49 or is the vendor scope to include the fabrication of a complete M-49 housing (using government supplied drawings), including a new door design and a carbon filter clamping mechanism?                            Answer:  The contractor shall have 1 4 M-49 housings from which to take measurements and investigate operation as part of CLIN 002.  These 14 housings will become part of the integrated CBR filters produced and installed under CLIN002.  The contractor shall be supplied with 2 M-49 filter tray s to use for form and fit and to test the clamping mechanism.  The contractor is expected to create a complete prototype housing in order to design and build the new door and clamping mechanism. We do not have a spare housing in our inventory.  A nominal 1 200 CFM housing may be able to be purchased from Pine Bluff Arsenal.  POC. Steven Gray at Pine Bluff 870-540-3033.
