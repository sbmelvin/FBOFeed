The U.S. Air Force determined that these capabilities are a functional requirement for the BCS-M system.  Most of the BCS-M data conversion interfaces and drivers operate in a Windows NT environment; however, the Mission Correlator/Tracker/Combiner interface is a LINUX based system.  Formation, Inc., is the only manufacturer producing a DADR System that records, archives and re-plays both voice and radar data.  It is also fully compatible with the existing processing equipment and operates in a Windows NT/ LINUX environment.  Formation, Inc. is the only known vendor with the capability of supplying the requirements to fulfill this requirement. Award is expected 30 September 2004.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, the Government will consider all information received by 17 September 2004 1530 EST.  A determination by the government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The government will not pay for any information received.  Facsimile proposals are acceptable.  For information contact Amanda Ankerman, Code 2.5.1.2.3.5, Telephone (301) 995-8672, FAX (301) 995-8670 or via e-mail: Amanda.Ankerman@navy.mil

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held—

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

FAR 52.217-8 AND 52.217-9 Option to extend contract.   The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items, applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation’s minimum criteria for technical acceptability at the lowest price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers. (Factor 1) To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must furnish product literature that demonstrates the products offered meet all requirements stated in the above purchase descriptions for Line Items 0001.  (Factor 2) Past Performance, contractors to submit previous three (3) contract numbers, names of agencies/companies and contacts for past three years.  (Factor 3) price  Offerors’ proposals will be evaluated first under factor 1 above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award. See paragraph b below. Only those offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor 1 will be further evaluated under Factors 2 and 3.  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor 1 to be technically acceptable., Factor 2 is approximately equal to Factor 3, price. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror’s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b) Technical capability of proposed item to meet the requirement, Factor 1, will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to offerors – commercial items, subparagraph (b) 4 which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors’ technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors’ technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technical unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically  unacceptable may not be considered further for award. © Offeror’s Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to Offerors – Commercial items, Subparagraph (6) 10, will be used  to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  Past Performance information should be provided on the form provided as in attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any offeror’s proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror’s past performance as follows: Neutral:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. Outstanding:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degration of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror’s past performance. Satisfactory:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror’s past performance. Marginal:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror’s past performance. (d) Options:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (of part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of  withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Human Embryonic Stem Cell Characterization Facility (HESCCF) plans to procure on a sole source basis services for Analysis of Gene Expression in Embryonic Stem Cells with Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Bunting-Blaustein Cancer Research Bldg, Room #262, 1650 Orleans St, Baltimore, MD 21231.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M. The NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Characterization Facility (HESCCF) has been acquiring and growing human Embryonic Stem cells for almost one year.  The HESCCF currently has many cultured lines and tested them for growth characteristics, viral contamination and karyotype integrity.  The NIH effort will play a unique role in an international effort that involves studies by groups in other countries including Canada, Australia, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  This collaboration will foster common standards of growth and characterization of undifferentiated human ES cells. The NIH HESCCF has an immediate role in two areas: 1) Comparison and characterization of stem cells on the NIH registry and; 2) Providing information and training on hES cells.  This service relates to the first of these assigned functions.  In this study, Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) analysis will be used to compare the patterns of gene expression in four different subclones of two hES cell lines. Differences in patterns of gene expression will be used to characterize the stability of the parent cell lines.  Sub-clones with distinct patterns of micro-array methods and gene expression will be analyzed for their growth and differentiation properties.  The NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Characterization Facility is proposing to procure the Analysis of Gene Expression in Embryonic Stem Cells specifically from Dr. Robert Georgantas/Civin Lab, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.  The SAGE technology was developed at Johns Hopkins Medical School and this group has experience with the recently developed long-SAGE method that makes them unusually well placed to obtain high resolution transcription maps from ES cells.  The physical proximity of Johns Hopkins is another asset in this study as it will permit members of the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Characterization Facility to interact directly with the Johns Hopkins team.  This interaction may be particularly useful in developing maps of gene expression in small numbers of human ES cells with genetic or epigenetic changes.  Therefore, the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins is the only source known that can provide this service.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, September 21, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-40162-NG.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB), plans to procure on a sole source basis services for Tandem Repeat Gene Analysis: Association with Smoking Cessation Success in the ATBC Trial with BioServe Biotechnologies, Ltd., 1050 West Street, Laurel, MD 20707. This requirement will be procured in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541990 and the Business Size Standard is $6M.  This study will examine the relationship of genes to smoking behavior.  In particular, NCI proposes to determine the association of variations in genes in brain reward pathways with smoking cessation success.  This project also represents a collaborative effort among NCI divisions and staff, including scientists from the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), the Center for Cancer Research (CCR), and the Core Genotyping Facility (CGF).  Samples for these analyses will be drawn from the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study, originally a longitudinal, cohort study of heavy smoking Finnish males exploring the effectiveness of a nutritional intervention in preventing cancer.  The Cancer Prevention Studies Branch (CPSB) has been overseeing a number of follow-up analyses based on the ATBC trial and they have provided the samples that will be used for this project.  Given their expertise with this dataset, CPSB/CCR will also offer general oversight of the project and, when necessary, provide clarification on features of the original ATBC database.   The current project will utilize a nested case-control design and will investigate the potential role of a number of important genes associated with smoking cessation.  The objectives of this study are to (1) identify the prevalence among the ATBC participants of variations in key genes associated with nicotine metabolism and brain reward pathways believed to be linked with smoking behavior, (2) assess the association of each of these variations with success or failure of smoking cessation defined as a qualitative or dichotomous variable, and (3) investigate whether any of those variants are predictive of cessation success as a quantitative or continuous variable (e.g., regression, survival analysis).   BioServe Biotechnologies, Ltd. (BioServe) has completed the DNA extraction for 840 ATBC participant samples from whole blood, and conducted extensive normalization, re-quantitation, and aliquotting of the remaining samples of previously extracted DNA, which arrived in less-than-optimal condition from the NCI repository.  They currently have in their possession all of the samples needed to complete this project, aliquoted and/or plated in the format necessary for these analyses.  As part of that effort, the current project will be performed in parallel with an ongoing project being conducted by DCEG/NCI that is analyzing samples drawn from the Prostate Lung Colorectal Ovarian Cancer Prevention (PLCO) Trial to explore the possible genetic determinants of smoking.  Performing these two projects in parallel presents a unique opportunity to carry out synchronized analyses among smokers drawn from different samples with varying baseline smoking topographies.  In addition, this will allow for further collaboration between DCCPS and DCEG, the sharing of resources, and opportunities to present the findings to the scientific community simultaneously.  BioServe Biotechnologies is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the services required to fulfill this requirement.  They have extensive experience working with this sample set and currently have possession of all the samples needed to complete this analysis.  BioServe has extensive success in completing projects for NCI's Cancer Prevention Studies Branch and DCEG.  Projects include similar genotyping work using samples from the ATBC study, including multiple SNPs in both tobacco-related and non-tobacco-related genes.  BioServe provided extremely accurate and reproducible results on the SNP analysis and prevalence studies with the ATBC dataset. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Imaging Program, plans to procure on a sole source basis, service maintenance of the ClinArc, PACS hardware maintenance, and Cedara Licenses from Imaging Archive International LLC., 5966 Exeter Circle, Norcross, Georgia 30071.   The supplies and services are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 811310 and the business size standard is $6M.  The NCI, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) procured a ClinArc system with Cedara software from Imaging Archive International, LLC (IAI) last year. IAI ClinArc is the archive system that serves as the back bone for the CIP PACS system through the NCI Center for Bio-Informatics. The experience of IAI networking their ClinArc data archive management system with Cedara is critical for assuring the successful implementation and full functionality of these two products in the CIP PACS system. CIP has verified the functionality of this combined configuration of the ClinArc archive system and Cedara software and the performance of IAI using the Cedara product during the past twelve months. The Cedara software is a crucial part of the integrated image archive and display system that allows us to download, visualize, manipulate, and return images to the archive system (ClinArc) using the open source architecture and the DICOM standard for image formats which is unique to both the ClinArc Archive and Cedara image display/viewing software.  The procurement of the support and licenses is an extension of the service that Imaging Archive International (IAI) has been providing over the past year for an essentially combined proprietary image archive system (hardware and software [Cedara]).   Image Archive International (IAI) is one of the leading PACS archive vendors for open architecture that provides the infrastructure for "best of breed" systems.  For diagnostic workstation display software IAI has partnered with Cedara. While Cedara is a widely distributed and well-known display software platform for diagnostic PACS workstations, it is not sold directly but only provided through third parties such as IAI. The Cedara product was designed in close cooperation with clinical imagers to provide optimum viewing and work flow functionality. To this end, Cedara has developed and implemented unique functions with the Image Archive International (IAI) ClinArc archive system including bi-directional communication of such features as read status, etc. The experience of IAI networking their ClinArc data archive management system with Cedara is critical for assuring the successful implementation and full functionality of these two products in the CIP PACS system. CIP has verified the functionality of this configuration and the performance of IAI using the Cedara product over the last twelve months.  Imaging Archive International is the only source known that can provide the unique functions developed through the on-going collaboration between IAI ClinArc and Cedara, it cannot be provided by another third party vendor.  IAI was the originator of the system and is the only company that can maintain it appropriately.   This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the Detailed Design, Flight Production and Certification, and Deployment Life Cycle phases for the General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIER).  The purpose of the GLACIER system is to provide a versatile cryogenic freezing and storage unit for a broad range of Science on board International Space Station (ISS) and the Space Transportation System (STS-Space Shuttle).  The primary function of GLACIER will be to provide the capability to provide cryogenic preservation to science samples, with a wide variety of geometries, aboard ISS. Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).  Their proprietary design and approach has been determined to be the only GLACIER design which satisfies the NASA requirements at a reasonable and favorable cost.  Furthermore, award to any other source or recompetition at this stage would result in substantial duplication of cost that could not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling NASA's needs for this system. Therefore, no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The one-time pre-solicitation project site tour will be conducted on September 23, 2004, at 10:00 A.M. local time, at the Sugarloaf Recreation area. The project includes reconstruction of the Sugarloaf Campground. Reconstruction work includes installing and improving drainage structures, road and spur widening, constructing turnouts, hauling and placing fill and gravel surfacing materials. Also included in this project are the installation of two new accessible vault toilets and construction of tent and facility pads, and related signing. The USDA Forest Service intends to award one contract for this work. This project is located on the Laramie Ranger District of the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest/Thunder Basin National Grassland, approximately 11 miles west of Centennial, Wyoming. To access the Sugarloaf Recreation Area from Laramie, take Wyoming State Highway 130 through Centennial, Wyoming, and then approximately 11 miles west to the project area. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) System. The estimated start date is July 1, 2005. Contract duration will be 120 days. The magnitude of the project is between $250,000 and $500,000. This is an unrestricted acquisition. Note: Due to access to the project site in the spring being difficult at best, the site visit is being held this fall.  All potential offers are invited to attend. If you plan to attend the pre-solicitation site visit, contact Ruth Brado at 970-498-1151 not later than September 21, 2004. If there are no calls indicating attendance, the meeting will be cancelled. If funding becomes available, the solicitation, including the specifications, will be published at www.fedbizopps.gov and will state the date that offers are due. It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued and awarded this winter.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541   Technical Training Program to Encourage Use of Coal Mine Methane in Ukraine Public Notice - August 26, 2004 - September 5, 2004 Procurement Office: US Environmental Protection Agency, Administrative Contract Service Center (6202R), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Washington DC   20460, Attn:  Mark C. Mullen, Contracting Officer  Title: Technical Training Program to Encourage Use of Coal Mine Methane in Ukraine The United States Environmental Protection Agency, under Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13, intends to issue a sole source purchase order  to: Partnership for Energy and Environmental Reform (PEER) for Technical Training Services  PEER staff are located in Ukraine with its primary office in Donetsk, the heart of the Ukrainian coal industry.  The organization has many years experience working on recovery and use of coal mine methane  (CMM) and coalbed methane (CBM) in Ukraine.  Specifically, they have been working on coal mine methane issues in Ukraine since 1998 and are well-acquainted with the staffs at all levels of the applicable ministries in Ukraine including the Ministry of Fuels & Energy, Ministry of Ecology, and  Committee on Labor Safety.  The staff of PEER are also  very knowledgeable about the Ukrainian mining industry and have worked at most of the major mines in the country. They know the mine management and have significant credibility with industry and the government, attributes that are critical to  achieving success in Ukraine.    Partnership for Energy & Environmental Reform (PEER) is well-qualified to perform the tasks set forth in the scope of work, and their experience, knowledge of the Ukraine coal industry, contacts within the industry and Ukrainian Government, and their staff skills  make them uniquely qualified to carry out the requirements. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Coalbed Methane Outreach Program (CMOP) has an active technical assistance program to support the development of coal mine methane (CMM) projects in developing countries and economies in  transition.  Through the technical assistance program, EPA strives to promote technology transfer, encourage policy development to foster project implementation, identify project opportunities, and seek domestic and foreign investment to successfully implement projects.  As part of the  international program,  EPA has supported work in Ukraine since 1998.  Globally, Ukraine is the fifth largest emitter of CMM emissions.  Increasing recovery and use of CMM would have significant benefits for Ukraine including reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improved mine safety and mine  productivity, energy independence, and substitution of a cleaner-burning fuel. As part of these efforts, EPA has determined that the essential element necessary to increase CMM recovery is the actual deployment and operation of more effective gas drainage technology, and additional capacity  building to educate Ukrainian federal, regional and local government officials and technical experts on methane utilization options.   In Fall 2002, EPA working with the contractor prepared a general road map of the activities that would be required to implement an effective underground horizontal  drilling program in Ukraine.  As a follow on, the contractor, under Purchase Order No. 3W-1399-NANX, prepared a report for EPA addressing the requirements for creating a company to provide drilling services to the Ukrainian Government and coal industry.  Since the report was completed in December  2003, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the U.S. Department of State have launched a new $3.8 million coal  mine safety program in Ukraine to introduce long, horizontal drilling.  Based on these developments, EPA has agreed to support DOL's efforts by conducting a complimentary technical  program to encourage the deployment of downstream technologies to use the methane released by the enhanced gas drainage systems.  Specifically, the goal of this program is to introduce modern methane utilization techniques through a series of in-depth technical and market-based training courses,  directed by the contractor.  In addition, the contractor will produce and disseminate  important information about utilization options through brochures, circulars, and by other means.   The NAICS code for this procurement is 541, Technical Services.  No solicitation or request for quotation (RFQ)  is available.  Not withstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the EPA's requirements stated herein may submit a 2-page readable response (single space) identifying specific experience with this type of effort, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this  announcement, will be considered.  Any response failing to provide the aforementioned data will be disregarded.   Routine requests for a copy of the RFQ will be disregarded.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the  discretion of the Government.   The point of contact for this announcement is Mark Mullen at mullen.mark@epa.gov  This will be a one-time purchase order.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. EPA, Mark Mullen (6202R), 1200  Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460; or to facsimile number (202) 565-2562, or by email at mullen.mark@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541910   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Transportation and Regional Programs Division (TRPD) intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to NOP World Automotive of Southfield, MI. The purpose of this acquisition is to perform studies for a green fuels initiative. Under this Purchase Order, the Contractor shall integrate the results of three of its annual consumer surveys, AFI Household Fleet and Ownership  Study, Roper Green Gauge Study, and Market Influential Study, to enable TRPD to answer the following questions: (a) What costs, performance, and environmental expectation would motorists have if offered an EPA-designated, environmentally superior fuel for passenger vehicles? (b)  How many motorists  would be willing to pay a predetermined price premium for EPA-designated environmentally superior fuel? (c) How many vehicle fleet owners and operators can be reasonably expected to pay a predetermined price premium for an EPA-designated, environmentally superior fuel?  It has been determined that  because NOP World Automotive conducts the above-mentioned surveys and is the only known source with the infrastructure in place to integrate and cross-tabulate annual preexisting surveys that are able to be tailored to focus exclusively on automotive consumer behavior, environmental consumer  behavior, and the "market influentials" (a group of the consumer segment that sets trends for other segments of the market),  it is the only source uniquely qualified to satisfy EPA's requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541910. NO  SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.

<DESC>The National Cancer Insititute (NCI), Cancer Care Redesign(CaRe) intends on entering into a sole source contract with the Institute for Health Care Improvement, 375 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02215 for redesigning Cancer Care (CaRe).  This requirement is being processed based on FAR 13 the use of simplified acquisition procedures. The North American Industry Classification Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.0M.  The focus of CaRe is the care for patients with cancer and drawing on experienced faculty and internationlly-known experts for advice and assistance in oncology and other areas of medicine and research.  The mission of the Institute for Health Care Improvement (IHI( is to offer resources and services to assist health care organizations to improve on dramatic and long-lasting improvements that will enhance clinical outcomes and reduce cost.  The IHI is actively engaged with organizations to make improvments in the following areas: Critical Care, Workforce Development, Flow Through Acute Care Settings, Office Practices and Outpatient Settings, and Patient Safety.  The products and services procured through this contract will assist CaRe in developing a framework for the NCI on how best to go forward on a project to redesign cancer care - the focus and types of activities that will best meet their goals.  This procurement stems from a one-and-a-half day workshop held at the NIH in March 2004 and findings of an Institute of Medicine's Roundtable on Health Care Quality (JAMA, September, 1998) and a subsequent landmark IOM Study, Crossing the Quality Chasm, which proposed that health care organizations strive for six Aims: safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity.  The IHI will coordinate and summarize several activities.  In particlar, the activities will result in a better understanding of significant defects in care that if redesigned and embedded in care would eliminate or delay death from cancer, and reduce the pain and suffering of cancer patients who are cared for in the redesiged systems.  The Institute for Health Care Improvement is the only source know to the NCI that has the resources, experience, expertise, to support such an effort and to build on its own ongoing innovation efforts.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.

<DESC>Fossil Power Modification and Supplemental Maintenance Support Contract

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to purchase the following goods and services by Competitive Negotiation:
TVA intends to request within 60 days proposals from a list of prospective qualified construction firms.
The intent is to enter into a partnering agreement to conduct modification and supplemental maintenance work at a minimum of four (4) fossil generating plants, and possibly work at other TVA controlled facilities.  This work will consist of primarily contractor managed task work scopes for capital and operation and maintenance projects.  This work may also include supplemental staff augmentation.  This work would principally consist of major modification work (capital improvements and additions).  The total annual modification and maintenance work is estimated at 800,000 to 1.5 million craft man-hours.  TVA desires to select a firm that has a history of successful experience in fossil plant modification work.  In addition, the firm must have a corporate philosophy consistent with the concept of partnering and a genuine desire to enter into such an agreement.  TVA has certain minimum mandatory qualification requirements that Respondents must meet before consideration.  The following is a summary of the minimum mandatory requirements:

A) 	Has successfully completed or currently working on six (6) modification services projects at a fossil electrical generating plant in the United States since January 1, 1998.  These six (6) experiences shall have been performed in an outage environment.  Must directly employ and manage almost all craft labor with craft labor being obtained through union referral.  The craft labor and supervision for one(1) of these six (6) modification projects is to be greater than 150,000 man-hours and each of the remaining five (5) modification projects is individually to be greater than 50,000 man-hours.  Must have demonstrated the ability to have 3 or more concurrent outage projects going on separate facilities with at least 150 craft or more each.  At least two (2) of the 50,000 man hour or higher projects must be primarily fossil power boiler related projects.  Continuing services provided on a long term basis at multiple sites with multiple work releases will not be considered in the whole with regard to project magnitude.    This experience requirement must be met by the Respondent and not through the experience of others (no flow through).
B) 	Must have demonstrated boiler expertise to perform major fossil boiler outages plus auxillary equipment maintenance and replacement.
C) 	Has an acceptable safety program with a current EMR no greater than 1.0 and an OSHA/BLS Recordable Injury Frequency Rate no greater than 4.5.  Must have demonstrated ability to assign on site safety professionals.  Respondents must submit corporate safety record including workers compensation cost per man-hour and environmental compliance record for last five (5) years.
D) 	Has an established continuous improvement program.  Must provide as a minimum specific examples documenting program success as related to continuous improvement, communicating lessons learned, industry recognitions, etc. and be willing to share with TVA and other established alliances lessons learned and improvements in work processes.
E) 	Has experience in computer based project control systems, such as Primavera, and agrees to utilize TVA project control system for TVA modification work.
F) 	Has experience in the Microsoft Office software package and be able to run systems and data in the windows' environment.
G) 	Must have an electronic costs system capable of tracking estimated and actual craft unit rates and forecasting end of project cost based on productivity and progress reporting.
H) 	Demonstrate a history or ability of working with owners through an alliance or other types of a long term relationship.

Prior to issuing a request for proposal to the interested bidders, TVA will require all interested bidders to certify that they meet or exceed the above mandatory minimum requirements.  All interested bidders are required to supply a certification to TVA no later than 30 days after date of FBO publication.
Solicitation will issue 60 days after date of FBO publication.  Technical data will be furnished with solicitation.  Anticipated start date: June 2005 at selected TVA facilities.  

For copies of required mandatory minimum requirements certification and for further information, contact Richard D. Garrett, Contract Manager, (865)632-1090, email: rdgarrett@tva.gov.
All mandatory minimum requirements certification should be mailed to the attention of Richard D. Garrett, 1302 Topside Rd. Louisville, TN 37777.

<DESC>This serves as a “Notice of Intent” to award a sole source contract to Austin-Tetra, Inc, to identify purchase card merchants’ reporting information for the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  The GSA IT Acquisition Services center plans to negotiate with Austin Tetra on behalf of the Integrated Acquisition Environment for services required to provide comprehensive supplier discovery service to examine, classify, validate and append available business information to each matching supplier record.  The Austin-Tetra identifier is required so that the Government will have the ability to merge bank data on p-card purchases with Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) data.    The Austin-Tetra Number (A-TTM) is proprietary.  Austin-Tetra is the only company capable of matching CCR records to merchants who have accepted Federal Government P-Cards for purchases.  This sole source procurement is under the authority of FAR Subpart 5.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The period of performance is for one base year, with two, one-year option periods to be exercised at the Government’s discretion [FAR 52.232-19, Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, applicable].  All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 202-329-7250, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command - Picatinny has a requirement for a signature suppression device for the M107 Long Range Sniper  Rifle system.  The key functional characteristics of this device will be to  suppress the visual flash, sound, and muzzle blast (blowback) signature, which  occurs during the firing of the weapon.  The M107 is a variant of the  commercial semi-automatic Barrett M82A1 rifle (variations are inconsequential  for the suppressor), chambered for a .50 cal BMG ammunition with rail mounted  optical sights and an integral backup iron sight.  The M107 has a 29-inch long  barrel with a detachable muzzle brake.  The nominal muzzle velocity is 2,800  feet per second and the maximum effective range of the weapon is 2,000 yards,  with a standard 660-grain bullet.  This device cannot increase recoil, have an  adverse effect on safety, nor degrade the accuracy of the weapon.  It must have  a service life of at least 2,000 rounds.  Other important factors are  reliability, maintenance, weight, length, and cost.  A minimum production  capability of 90 per month is desired, with a surge capacity up to 135 per  month.  Offeror will be required to submit approximately 5 bid samples with  their proposals.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) and U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Health Level Seven, Inc. a not-for-profit Michigan corporation at 3300 Washtenaw Avenue, Suite 227, Ann Arbor, MI 48104, for a three-year contract.  The contract will provide NLM with (1) data and services necessary to ensure Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) vocabularies as distributed through NLM's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus are usable with Health Level Seven (HL7). Examples of this work include designation of which parts of CHI standard vocabularies are valid for which parts of HL7 messages; recommendations for how best to represent these relationships properly in the UMLS; comparison of appropriate HL7 lists of coded values to CHI standard vocabularies to determine if some of them can be replaced by subsets of a CHI standard vocabulary; advice/assistance on various matters related to the use of UMLS vocabulary tools, documentation, and related materials in conjunction with the HL7 standard.  (2) creation of an easily implementable HL7 standard to identify the generic content of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) in a manner that facilitates integration with vocabulary standards as distributed through the UMLS and specifying how that content is sent in a way that it can be received, understood and used independent of the actual architecture and structure of the sending and receiving systems.  Examples of this work include analyzing the two current HL7 standard approaches to determine the functional gaps; studying related research efforts to determine what existing resources can be drawn upon to fill these gaps; drafting standards and testing them against reality in demonstration implementations; recommendations for the best means of representing and integrating this new HL7 standard in the UMLS.  

HL7 is an ANSI-accredited standards developing organization (SDO) that produces proprietary message format standards for clinical and administrative health data.  Like all ANSI-accredited SDOs, HL7 adheres to a strict and well-defined set of operating procedures that ensures consensus, openness and balance of interest. Members of HL7 are known collectively as the Working Group, which is organized into technical committees and special interest groups. The technical committees are directly responsible for the content of the Standards. Special interest groups serve as a test bed for exploring new areas that may need coverage in HL7's published standards.  HL7 is the only organization that can expand and enhance HL7 standards.

The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) in February 2002 recommended the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services adopt HL7 as a core Patient Medical Record Information (PMRI) message format standard.  The Consolidated Health Informatics Initiative endorsed this recommendation in the fall of 2002 by recommending the adoption of HL7 as the common messaging format standard to be used by federal health care facilitates for the exchange of health care information.  On March 21, 2003, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Defense, and Veterans Affairs announced HL7 as one of the first set of uniform standards to be adopted across the federal government for the electronic exchange of clinical health information.  In July 2003 the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to work with HL7 to design and ballot a standardized model of an electronic health record.  At the July 2003 National Health Information Infrastructure Conference the Standards and Vocabulary Track recommended expediting the alignment of HL7 models and messages with standard vocabularies as well as accelerated adoption of the NCVHS and CHI recommendations.  In its November 5, 2003 letter to the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, the NCVHS recommended adoption of a core set of PMRI Terminology Standards.  This letter further recommended coordination between the PMRI Message Format Standards (including HL7) and the PMRI Terminology Standards. In addition, HL7 is the proposed message standard for the Claims Attachment transaction of the Administration Simplification section of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  

While Health Level Seven, Inc.'s existing standards and guides are increasingly being recognized and recommended for implementation in the health care sector, these standards and guides need to be expanded and refined to work effectively with standard vocabularies.   Since HL7 standards and guides are proprietary products of Health Level Seven, Inc. any changes to them can only be achieved from within HL7 and by consensus of the organizations membership.  NLM has therefore determined that Health Level Seven, Inc. is the only source capable of providing these services.  However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information for planning purposes on engineering support for the development, fabrication, and test of an air to ground missile system similar to the AGM-114 Hellfire or Brimstone-class designed for fighter/attack jets.  This is a request for information only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is conducting an initiative to evaluate the concept of using numerous, light (<150lbs), lethal missiles for engaging a wide range of moving and stationary surface targets from conventional USAF fighter and attack jets.  Preliminary modeling and simulation results from this initiative indicate a variety of operational advantages may be offered by this concept.  The envisioned system should utilize either proven semi-active laser homing or active seeker technology to provide precise guidance either from the employing aircraft or off-board designators.  In addition, the envisioned standoff range would be at least equal or better than current AGM-114 launch from medium altitudes.  Target sets and current technology suggest blast/fragmentation, thermo baric, and shaped charge are the desired range of warhead options.  High weapons load out, low collateral damage potential, and simplified maintenance are some of the other envisioned benefits from this class of weapon.  The AEFB is primarily interested in -Off-The-Shelf products that could be adapted for this purpose.

Request information be submitted NO LATER THAN_19 August 2004_ to Major. Patrick Sullivan, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Major Sullivan can be reached at (208) 828-3511.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for the envisioned effort.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Mark Mullen, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-4516
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541   Technical Training Program to Encourage Use of Coal Mine Methane in Ukraine Public Notice - September 7 - September 13, 2004 Procurement Office: US Environmental Protection Agency, Administrative Contract Service Center (6202R), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Washington DC   20460, Attn:  Mark C. Mullen, Contracting Officer  Title: Technical Training Program to Encourage Use of Coal Mine Methane in Ukraine The United States Environmental Protection Agency, under Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13, intends to issue a sole source purchase order  to: Partnership for Energy and Environmental Reform (PEER) for Technical Training Services  PEER staff are located in Ukraine with its primary office in Donetsk, the heart of the Ukrainian coal industry.  The organization has many years experience working on recovery and use of coal mine methane  (CMM) and coalbed methane (CBM) in Ukraine.  Specifically, they have been working on coal mine methane issues in Ukraine since 1998 and are well-acquainted with the staffs at all levels of the applicable ministries in Ukraine including the Ministry of Fuels & Energy, Ministry of Ecology, and  Committee on Labor Safety.  The staff of PEER are also  very knowledgeable about the Ukrainian mining industry and have worked at most of the major mines in the country. They know the mine management and have significant credibility with industry and the government, attributes that are critical to  achieving success in Ukraine.    Partnership for Energy & Environmental Reform (PEER) is well-qualified to perform the tasks set forth in the scope of work, and their experience, knowledge of the Ukraine coal industry, contacts within the industry and Ukrainian Government, and their staff skills  make them uniquely qualified to carry out the requirements. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Coalbed Methane Outreach Program (CMOP) has an active technical assistance program to support the development of coal mine methane (CMM) projects in developing countries and economies in  transition.  Through the technical assistance program, EPA strives to promote technology transfer, encourage policy development to foster project implementation, identify project opportunities, and seek domestic and foreign investment to successfully implement projects.  As part of the  international program,  EPA has supported work in Ukraine since 1998.  Globally, Ukraine is the fifth largest emitter of CMM emissions.  Increasing recovery and use of CMM would have significant benefits for Ukraine including reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, improved mine safety and mine  productivity, energy independence, and substitution of a cleaner-burning fuel. As part of these efforts, EPA has determined that the essential element necessary to increase CMM recovery is the actual deployment and operation of more effective gas drainage technology, and additional capacity  building to educate Ukrainian federal, regional and local government officials and technical experts on methane utilization options.   In Fall 2002, EPA working with the contractor prepared a general road map of the activities that would be required to implement an effective underground horizontal  drilling program in Ukraine.  As a follow on, the contractor, under Purchase Order No. 3W-1399-NANX, prepared a report for EPA addressing the requirements for creating a company to provide drilling services to the Ukrainian Government and coal industry.  Since the report was completed in December  2003, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the U.S. Department of State have launched a new $3.8 million coal  mine safety program in Ukraine to introduce long, horizontal drilling.  Based on these developments, EPA has agreed to support DOL's efforts by conducting a complimentary technical  program to encourage the deployment of downstream technologies to use the methane released by the enhanced gas drainage systems.  Specifically, the goal of this program is to introduce modern methane utilization techniques through a series of in-depth technical and market-based training courses,  directed by the contractor.  In addition, the contractor will produce and disseminate  important information about utilization options through brochures, circulars, and by other means.   The NAICS code for this procurement is 541, Technical Services.  No solicitation or request for quotation (RFQ)  is available.  Not withstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the EPA's requirements stated herein may submit a 2-page readable response (single space) identifying specific experience with this type of effort, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this  announcement, will be considered.  Any response failing to provide the aforementioned data will be disregarded.   Routine requests for a copy of the RFQ will be disregarded.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the  discretion of the Government.   The point of contact for this announcement is Mark Mullen at mullen.mark@epa.gov  This will be a one-time purchase order.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. EPA, Mark Mullen (6202R), 1200  Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460; or to facsimile number (202) 565-2562, or by email at mullen.mark@epa.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER TYPES OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  

This is a sources sought/market research conducted in accordance with FAR Part 10.  The 16th Special Operations Wing (SOW), Hurlburt AFB FL is currently performing market research to determine what types of commercial service offerings and related capabilities currently exist for Voice (Cellular Telephone) products and related services.  The 16 SOW seeks responses to this RFI from commercial sources to indicate what kinds of cellular phone products and related services that they can offer.  

Currently, 16 SOW users have phone instruments that use GSM, as well as TDMA and CDMA signaling in both analog and digital modes.  Some cellular instruments are capable of mobile to mobile (radio to radio) mode and some operate as telephones only.  There is a requirement of Type I secure telephone instruments in some cases.  Voice mail and caller ID are required by most 16 SOW users.  Cellular instruments are not allowed video or still picture capture or transmission capability.  Direct Internet access or Internet email is not allowed in any form.   16 SOW users have a need for international, national, regional and local calling plans.  Users utilize pool minutes for multiple phones, and "roll over" minutes for airtime not used in the parameters of the monthly billing period.  Interconnectivity with Federal, State and local agencies for mutual aid, major accident response and disaster prep coordination is also required.  All costs incurred will be to the individual end using unit, and will be the responsibility of the end using unit, to be paid by the unit Telephone Control Officer (TCO) or unit Resource Advisor (RA) using their unit Government Purchase Card (GPC).  

In responding to this RFI, respondents should indicate whether currently commercially available solutions are available that can provide one or more of the following services/capabilities and exactly how the system works:  (1) Currently available cell phones; (2) Specifications for those phones; (3) Features and capabilities of those phones; including those indicated in the paragraph above; (4) Indication of whether a trade-in program for older cellular phones is available; (5) Warranty offerings; (6) Repair offerings for broken phones not covered by warranty or outside of warranty provisions; (7) Replacement policy of older phones on some periodic basis; (8)  Details of currently available cell phone plans;  (9) Related usage plans that may be purchased with the currently available cellular phones; (10) Minutes for usage could be rolled over and/or shared among multiple users; (11) Discounts available based on level of consumption of a large number of users and, if so, how it works; (12) Any other discounts that are available based on a large number of users that all have the same service; (13) Termination charges could be waived for early termination of individual cell phone plans if they are a part of a pool of users all under the same calling plan.  

In addition, the 16 SOW seeks commercial price list information (or possible range of pricing if commercial list price does not exist) for cell phones and calling plans, as noted above that are currently available in the marketplace.  This pricing should reflect how current cell phones and related calling plans are currently priced and structured for commercial marketplace sales, including any tiered pricing that is available.  Respondents are encouraged to provide the most aggressive pricing available.  

Finally, the 16 SOW seeks to determine whether currently commercially available cell phones and calling plans could potentially be procured on a multiple year contract basis (i.e., contract with a base period of one year and one-year options to extend the term of the contract, including pre-priced line items for predefined cell phone specifications and calling plans for them.)  

Respondents should email responses and, if available, commercially available literature and commercial price list information to richard.bremer@hurlburt.af.mil no later than 17 Sep 04.  Such responses will be used to assist the 16 SOW in determining how to construct minimum requirements in the event that procurement is conducted in the future.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory is developing a Weapon Data Link (WDL) to provide the communication link needed to: redirect and adjust weapon impact points using accurate location information, obtain weapon status information during the flight, and provide Bomb Impact Assessment (BIA).  Most air-to-ground weapons have no in- flight communication capabilities and as a result, once a weapon is released, there is no ability to redirect the weapon to an updated location for a moving target, relocated target, or safe zone in the case of a wave-off.  Weapons equipped with data links today are typically unique solutions addressing a specific need of the particular Department of Defense (DoD) service and these solutions (e.g. AWW-13, AXQ-14) are typically not interoperable with other systems in service.  The WDL Architecture Description Document describes the elements for a networked communication between the Weapon and the various Tactical Launch, Command and Control (C2), and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), platforms that will increase the effectiveness of communications in the theatre of operations.  

The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate is seeking industry and military user community comments on the draft release of the WDL Architecture Description Document.  This request for comments is not a request for competitive proposals, and will not result in a Government contract.  Any submittal constitutes authorization for limited reproduction and dissemination within Government Agencies and National Laboratories deemed appropriate.  All comments must be received by close of business, 30 Sep 04.  

In order to receive the WDL Architecture Description Document draft, interested parties must submit a current, certified copy of their DD Form 2345, MILITARILY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT, to the following address prior to release of the document:  AFRL/MNGN (Attn: CMSgt Don Clabaugh), 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Ste 144, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810, DSN:  872-5388 x 1260, Comm:  850-882-5388 x1260, Fax:  872-4974.

<SUBJECT>88 -- Purchase Research Animals
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Plum Island Animal Disease Center, Orient Point, New York, on behalf of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, ARS, NAA, intends to negotiate solely with Thomas D. Morris Inc., 4001 Millender Mill Rd, Reisterstown, MD for the purchase of 100 head of cattle to be delivered within a six month period.  In FY2004 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funded the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) through a reimbursable agreement to accelerate development  and testing of vaccines and anti-virals against foot-and-mouth disease in livestock. A significant part of this work involves testing combinations of vaccine, adjuvants and anti-virals in cattle.  In order to minimize variability between tests and variation coming from animals, it is important to obtain homogenous animals from reliable suppliers. It is important that these suppliers are located close to the East coast so that stress associated to long transportation times are avoided. All previous vaccine trails have been carried out with animals from this supplier and have yielded consistent and reportable results. The proximity of the supplier to the Plum Island Animal Disease Center minimizes the shipping costs and logistics of ordering and receiving animals at this laboratory.  Most importantly, the animals from Thomas Morris are of a consistent quality in health and vitality, eliminating the common experience of receiving sick or otherwise compromised animals and having to reschedule trials after replacement animals are received.  This notice is neither a request for quotations nor a solicitation of offers.  Based on the above requirements, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority FAR 6.302.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement on a full and open competitive basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No formal solicitation package is available. The Government anticipates award on September 14, 2004.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs in the preparation of responses to this announcement.

The new standard issue frame will replace Military Specification MIL-S-0037954B, dated 15 Aug 1990.  Direct requests for this military specification to Harry Seto, phone: 215-737-2190, or email: paa3330@dscp.dla.mil *** CONTACT INFORMATION FOR ASHEAI PATTERSON IS 215-737-2159; FAX: 215-737-8150; E-MAIL: ASHEAI.PATTERSON@DLA.MIL

Ultimately, these frames shall be ordered by DoD optical labs through DSCP’s ECAT (Internet-based ordering platform), the government’s electronic catalogue for optical fabrication. ***

3.  Potential suppliers of the standard issue S9 replacement frame may refer to the cited military specification for general guidance on form, fit, and function; however, the Government’s objective is to procure a commercially available, off-the-shelf frame that meets commercial standards such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z-87.1 or comparable American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) standards.  In addition, frames must meet the Z-80.5(1997) Ophthalmics - Requirements for Ophthalmic Frames. ***

The temple shall not restrict peripheral vision.  No color is specified.  For the frame of choice program, current trends and styles will be considered to include both zyl and metal frames. ***

5.  Sources interested in responding to this request shall submit frames of varying sizes, both with and without nose pads.  Product literature, color pictures, and technical specifications and estimated price quotations shall also be submitted. ***

6.  The Government encourages innovative design ideas from industry.  ***

Describe how quality control will be integrated into your proposed teaming approach and the A/E’s involvement in quality control throughout the project.  Provide a narrative of no more five pages. Factor 4a – Subcontracting History.  Factor 4a is intended to obtain the offerors history of subcontracting to Small Business, Small Disadvantaged, Historically underutilized small zone small businesses, women owned small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses and historically black college and university/minority institutes.  Factors 4a and 4b are subfactors equal in importance to each other.  Factor 4b will be evaluated under Phase II and an overall rating for this factor will be assigned.  Offerors must address the following in sufficient detail to allow proper evaluation and rating: Provide SF-294 forms, "Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts”, for projects identified under technical factor 1, Relevant Past Performance.   If the reference projects were not DOD procurements and an SF-294 was not required, provide any other documentation showing compliance with the utilization of Small Business firms in each noted category. (e.g., Small, Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone Small, Veteran Owned small, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small and Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions, if applicable).  Include the dollar value and percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to these entities.  If goals were not met on the reference contracts, provide an explanation as to why.  Provide information on any awards you’ve received within the past three (3) years for outstanding support to the small business community. Provide performance evaluation ratings obtained on implementation of subcontracting plans, if available, on the DOD contracts submitted under (a) above.  Provide information on existing or pending mentor-protégé agreements.  Provide information, if available, on use of Community Rehabilitation Programs organizations certified under the Javits-Wagner O’Day Program (JWOD) by NISH or NIB.  PAST PERFORMANCE.  Past Performance information is one indicator of an offeror’s ability to perform this contract successfully.  This evaluation will include the performance history of both the construction entity and the design entity.  The currency and relevancy of the information, source of information, context of data, and general trends in a contractor’s performance shall be taken into consideration.  The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror to the other competitors and establishes a level of confidence or risk for successful performance under this contract.  Past Performance findings will influence the relative standing of the offeror. Findings will be used to validate proposals against established criteria.  By contacting references provided under Factors 1, 2 and 3, the Government will evaluate the offerors past performance.   Offerors are authorized to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective actions taken.  In investigating the contractor’s past performance, the Government is not limited to the references submitted but may rely on other sources as well.  Evaluation of Past Performance will be a subjective assessment.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services as well as fair and reasonable pricing.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s record of conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship, and will evaluate the offeror’s record on cost control/change orders and adherence to contract schedules.  Subcontractor management, safety management and other quality control programs will also be reviewed.  The Government will examine the offeror’s record for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and in general, the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer. Offerors may be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the offeror’s response will be taken into consideration.  A review of CCAS and ACAS may be performed.  PHASE II.  Factor 4b – Subcontracting Plan (project specific).  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command has established subcontracting targets of at least 73.7% of the subcontracting efforts to small business firms.  Of the total subcontracted effort, the targets are a minimum of 3.1% to HUBZone Small Business firms, 15.3% to SDB firms, 13.8% to WOSB firms, 3% to SDVOSB firms.  Large business firms will be evaluated against these targets with more credit given to firms who exceed these targets.  NOTE:  The Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be incorporated in the resultant contract. FAR 52.219-8, UTILIZATION of SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS states in part, “The Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.”  If the offerors does not intend to subcontract any of the work to small businesses, provide a detailed explanation as to why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  Note:  A detailed description of the offerors outreach programs is to be ncluded in item “b”, Subcontracting Plan Effort, Subcontracting Plan, item #8(a). Definitions/Guidance:  The Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Procurement Marketing and Access Network (PRONET) is an online, interactive electronic gateway of procurement information for and about small businesses.  PRONET contains more than 195,000 company profiles of small businesses, small disadvantaged business, women owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, veteran owned small business, and service disabled veteran owned small businesses.  Also listed are small disadvantaged business firms that have been certified by SBA.  Use of SBA certified small disadvantaged business firms are mandatory for large businesses subcontracting work in accordance with DOD small business subcontracting plans.  As of 01 October 1999, small disadvantaged business contractors and subcontractors must receive certification by SBA.  Additionally, SBA must certify all HUBZone small businesses.  The prime contractor is expected to make every effort possible to accomplish the targets as assigned.   PRONET is available on SBA’s website page at http://www.sba.gov.  Evaluation will include the extent of participation of small businesses in terms of the total value of the acquisition.  Identify, in terms of dollar value and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  Identify the extent of participation of small businesses in terms of the value of total acquisition.  Submit with your proposal, a “subcontracting plan” for this project which shall include the total contract value (including all option periods), the dollar value and percentage of the total subcontracted effort to LB, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZONE SB, VOSB, SDVOSB.  Electronic copies of the Subcontracting Plan format can be found on the Internet at www.efdlant.navfac.navy.mil under Small Business Information, under the paragraph entitled Subcontracting Opportunities.  If firm commitments to subcontract exist, list the subcontractors, by name.  Otherwise, list the type of services to be subcontracted.  If the subcontracting targets proposed are less than the NAVFAC subcontracting targets, provide supporting rational.  JOINT VENTURES.  If you are submitting an offer as a joint venture, identify, for each member of your joint venture, whether the member is a LB, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZONE SB, VOSB, and SDVOSB and the value in terms of dollars of the work to be performed by each member of your joint venture.  The Government will evaluate your joint venture as either a large business or small business based upon the information provided in 1, directly above.

Answer:  No, the 50 mile radius requirement is not flexible.

Answer:  No, the 50 mile radius for this requirement cannot be waived.

QUESTION:

3.  As it is presently written, would a proposal from us be considered, or would it be judged to be non-qualifying?  

Answer:  Proposals not responsive to the RFP requirement will not be considered.

QUESTION:

4. On the first page, the statement that .... "Travel NTE $10,000".  Is this the total limit for travel for the full year of the contract?  

Answer:  "Travel NTE $10,000 is the estimated amount of Travel cost for the Base Year.

QUESTION:

5. Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.21203 - **Proprietary **/** High Priority **.   I am trying to find out what the above stated provision entails.  Please advise.

Answer:  You can located this clause in detail at www.arnet.gov.

QUESTION:

6.  Could you please provide guidance concerning the form and format required for responses to the referenced solicitation?  

Answer:  There's no required format.

QUESTION:

7.  Are there specific forms which can be accessed or is a traditional proposal acceptable?

<DESC>This is Amendment Number 03 to the combined synopsis/solicitatation for commercial services previously posted.  The due date and time remains 11:00 A.M. Mountain time, Tuesday, September 14, 2004 which is reflected in the revised RFQ package associated to Amendment 03.  An electronic copy of the revised RFQ package for Amendment Number 03 is available by contacting Marjorie.watson@tma.osd.mil and Brenda.agner@tma.osd.mil.  Your quotation is to be submitted on this revised RFQ package.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.  This amendment identifies questions received and provides all interested parties with the Government’s response.  The following is a list of questions received and the Government’s responses.


1.  What format is the data sent in?  XML, Raw, Delimited?

Answer:  The format of the FTP file will be determined when the contract is awarded.


2.  How many datasets a day can we expect to equate to 22,000?

Answer:  It will be one dataset per day, there may be exceptions when none are submitted or more than one will be submitted.


3.  Is TRICARE trying to get away from linking to hnfs.com for that info?

Answer:  No.  If you select a region it will link you to the Managed Care Contractor responsible for that region.  Select the link for TRICARE Standard which will link you to the provider information that TMA is using as input for this solicitation.


4.  Is TRICARE looking for a GIS (Geographic Information System) mapping application that someone else will be responsible for hosting and maintaining?

Answer:  Yes.


5.  How many members will have access to the provider search site?  

Answer:  The web site is open for access by the public.


6.  Is a link to mapquest.com (as in the provider search at https://www.triwest.com/triwest/default2.html) and acceptable solution?

Answer:  Technically acceptable proposals which fulfill TMA requirements will be evaluated for award.

7.  Section G2.1 of the subject solicitation states “Contractor shall invoice the government on an annual basis”.  This invoicing process seems highly unusual and would present contractors a cash flow problem.  Would TRICARE consider allowing monthly invoicing?  

Answer:  Invoices for CLINS X001, X002 and X003 should be submitted on a monthly basis.  CLINS X004, X005 and X006 are costs above and beyond the base contract cost.  They are unit costs for anything above the base numbers.  They will be evaluated on a unit cost basis.  For X004 we will look at the cost per address transaction above the base number.  On the X005 we will look at the cost per map transaction above the base number.  On X006 we will look at the cost per hour for technical support.  Again, these are all on an as needed basis.  If the base numbers are not exceeded, there will be no costs for one, two or all three of these line items.


8.  4.7 states that “Search results are to include the driving distance for each provider listed from the users address in addition to the Provider File data.  An option if requested by the user is a zoom-able map, and driving directions.  Would a link to a service, such as MapQuest, be acceptable for the map and driving directions?

Answer:  Technically acceptable proposals which fulfill TMA requirements will be evaluated for award.


9.  Can you clarify for me if I only need to submit the signed original Standard Form, Section B, Section G and Section K.  And I do not need to submit the other sections?

Answer:  When submitting your quotation be sure to follow the directions stated in the RFQ package.  Complete the information required in sections B, G and K and submit to TMA.  Also, forward any technical information, please limit your technical information to not more than 30 one sided pages of not smaller twelve pitch print.  Technical information will not be returned to the quoting firms and if it is proprietary it shall be clearly marked as such.

10.  It is expected that some percentage of the initial 4 million records to be geo-coded will have invalid data and fail the geo-coding process.  Is the offeror to return the error transactions for address corrections to the department?

Answer:  Yes return the error.


11.  If errors are to be returned, indicate the format of the information i.e. printed or electronic report or electronic transactions file of detail transactions.

Answer:  Electronic transaction file of detail transactions.


12.  It is expected that some percentage of the 20,000 add and change records to be geo-coded will have invalid data and fail the geo-coding process.  Is the offeror to return the error transactions for address correction to the department.

Answer:  Yes return the error.


13.  If they are to be returned, please indicate the format of the information i.e. printed or electronic report or electronic transaction file of detail transactions.

Answer:  Electronic transaction file of detail transactions.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), has a requirement to purchase a Subscription Service to facilitate and consolidate the purchase, delivery, and management of journals, books, trade magazines, and other periodicals as may be required by all on-campus laboratories of the NIDDK.  This service will be used mainly to facilitate tracking, canceling, and ordering of current, expiring, and new upcoming requirements for journals and other periodicals.  This service will be for a total of up to five years, consisting of a base year with four sequential option years.  

Detailed technical specifications are as follows:


I. Background

Scientific journals and other serial subscriptions are required by The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Division of Intramural Research (subsequently cited as NIDDK) in order to provide a means of communicating and widely distributing new scientific theories, experiments, and technologies, as well as communicating general and field specific discussions on advanced scientific issues. Scientific journals, magazines, proceeding publications and other written serial subscriptions are the widely accepted tool for publishing scientific achievements or results. 

It is intended that a serial subscription provider (subsequently cited as the Vendor) be awarded a purchase order to provide all required full serial subscription services for one serial subscription delivery year, beginning January 1, 2006, with an option of four additional delivery years. In order to provide a reasonable amount of time to contact publishers and to provide the government its quote, the period of performance will begin each August 1 prior to the start of each serial subscription delivery year. NIDDK defines the serial subscription delivery year to begin the first day of January and end the last day of December. NIDDK may request new subscriptions, title cancellations, and address changes at any time during the performance period or the serial subscription delivery year but all subscriptions should expire December 31 of any year ordered, excluding titles that have been canceled prior to December 31.  NIDDK currently has serial subscription services provided by EBCSO. Any vendor awarded this requirement must be able to renew or reorder all current NIDDK serials, as well as any new titles with no delay or break in the current delivery service, and be able to begin serial subscription delivery for all titles on January 1, 2006. 

II. Technical Requirements for Submission of RFQ and Evaluation

Initial Government Responsibilities:

•	NIDDK guarantees a total of 300 delivered journals as a minimum requirement for each serial subscription delivery year and a maximum quantity requirement of 1200. 
•	NIDDK will provide any vendor the master list of currently ordered serial titles with the quantity required and sorted by delivery address in order for each vendor to prepare price quotes.
•	A purchase order will be awarded to the vendor that can renew all of NIDDK’s currently ordered subscription titles at the lowest overall price, taking past performance, ability to provide all needed subscription services, and all other technical factors into account. 

 Government Responsibilities After Award:

•	After award of the purchase order, NIDDK will revise the master list to include any title additions or deletions, as well as any delivery address changes and submit it to the vendor by November 1, 2005.

Initial Vendor Responsibilities:

•	Each vendor must prepare and submit a separate quote for each NIDDK delivery address that clearly states the title of each subscription, the cost of each subscription, the delivery time-frame of each title (quarterly, monthly, etc.), the cumulative service charge for each designated delivery address, and whether the publisher allows for refunds of early cancellations.
•	A one-page cover sheet must be included on top of the package of delivery address quotes that clearly states the total cost for subscriptions and the total cost of service charges.  
•	Any vendor that submits the initial price quote that does not include all current NIDDK serial subscription titles must clearly state which titles have been omitted on a separate list and sort the omitted title list by delivery address. A quote submitted that does not include every current NIDDK serial subscription title will be deemed non-compliant. 
•	A statement must be included with each vendor’s quote that clearly describes the vendor’s capability of meeting all requirements as discussed in the Statement of Work.





Initial Vendor Responsibilities After Award:

•	After award, the vendor will await the revised delivery address list from NIDDK prior to placing final orders with publishers.
•	The vendor will receive the revised subscription list from NIDDK by November 1, 2005. 
•	The vendor will use this revised list as the final master subscription list for the delivery year. The Vendor must perform all required tasks needed to order and guarantee that all subscriptions begin delivery to the correct delivery addresses on January 1, 2006, with no delay or break in service from the previous delivery year subscriptions.
•	The vendor will prepare and submit to NIDDK an amended confirmation report for each NIDDK delivery address that clearly states the title of each subscription, the cost of each subscription, the delivery time-frame of each title (quarterly, monthly, etc.), the cumulative service charge for each designated delivery address and whether the publisher allows for refunds of early cancellations. A one-page cover sheet must be included on top of the package of delivery address reports that clearly states the total cost for subscriptions and the total cost of service charges. This amended final confirmation report must be returned to NIDDK by December 1, 2005. This report will act as confirmation that all titles have been ordered and that all subscriptions will begin January 1, 2006, with no delay or break in service from previous subscriptions.
