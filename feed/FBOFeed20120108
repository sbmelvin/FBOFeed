<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC)is releasing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Edison Small Satellite FlightDemonstration Missions in support of the Office of Chief Technologist (OCT). The BAA willbe available on or around January 23, 2012, by opening the NASA Research Opportunitieshomepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/    and then linking through the menu listings toOpen Solicitations.NASA, through this BAA, plans to seek proposals for low-cost, flight demonstrations forsmall satellite technology. This procurement will accelerate the development of smallspacecraft capabilities for NASA, commercial, and other space sector users.  Successfulproposals will provide a compelling infusion strategy that ensures that the proposedtechnology will find active utility after the completion of the flight demonstrationmission.The small spacecraft demonstration missions under the Edison Program are intended toflight- validate one or more small spacecraft subsystem technologies or missioncapabilities with game-changing and/or crosscutting potential, specifically maturationfrom NASA Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 5 or 6 to TRL 7.  Attachment A providesofficial definitions for NASAs Technology Readiness Levels.  Game-changing technologiesare defined as subsystems or mission capabilities that are a major advance over thecurrent state-of-the-art or that represent the creation of a previously non-existentsmall spacecraft capability.  Crosscutting technologies are defined as subsystems ormission capabilities with applicability to more than one potential small spacecraft userin the space sector, including NASA Mission Directorates or other civil, commercial,and/or national security users.The topic areas of interest in this solicitation will be limited to demonstrations ofcommunications systems for small satellites, proximity operations with small satellites,and propulsion systems for Cubesat-scale spacecraft.  NASA anticipates that these smallspacecraft missions will be launched as secondary payloads or hosted payloads with otherspacecraft missions but may eventually include dedicated launches as primary payloads onvery small launch vehicles, if and when these launch vehicles come into existence.  Theuse of Government-furnished secondary launch and hosted payload capabilities may beproposed.  Proposers may also propose their own secondary launch or hosted payloadcapability. Through this BAA, NASA anticipates funding two types of demonstration missions: Subsystem Flight Validation (SFV) missions and Mission Capability Demonstrations (MCDs).SFV missions take advantage of the accessibility and affordability of small spacecraft torapidly flight-validate novel small spacecraft subsystems without necessarily attemptingto demonstrate an overall mission capability.  MCDs advance the state-of-the-artcapabilities in small spacecraft, demonstrating how small spacecraft can be used toperform more capable or less costly missions than larger spacecraft or even to create newmission capabilities.  SFV missions must complete design, development, testing and evaluation within two years. MCDs must complete design, development, testing and evaluation within three years.  NASAfunding for SFV missions is limited to a maximum of $10 million, while funding for MCDsis limited to $15M, with both dependent upon funding availability. Missions that requireless funding are encouraged.There will be a two-step proposal process.  Proposers will be required to submit anExecutive Summary on or around February 24, 2012.  Full proposals will be due on oraround May 4, 2012.   Proposals shall be submitted electronically, and all proposers shall use NASAs proposaldata system, NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com    ). In addition, the electronicproposals must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization.Participation is open to all categories of organizations, including educationalinstitutions, industry, nonprofit organizations, Federally Funded Research andDevelopment Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), the JetPropulsion Laboratory (JPL), NASA Centers, and other Government agencies. Everyorganization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this BAA must be registeredwith NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizationalrepresentative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. Potential proposers andproposing organizations are urged to access the electronic proposal system(s) well inadvance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure andenter the requested information. Specific proposal submission deadline dates, evaluationcriteria, and submission information will be identified in the BAA.It is anticipated that fixed price and/or cost reimbursement contracts may be awardedthrough this solicitation.  An appropriate interagency or intra-agency agreement will beused for awardees of Federal entities. Awards based on this solicitation are contingent on availability of appropriated funds. Obtain additional programmatic information from: http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/crosscutting_capability/edison/index.html   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541712 and 1,000 employees, respectively.

<DESC>INVITATION FOR OFFER  - FEDERAL NATURAL GAS LIQUIDSIFO NO.  BLM-2012-CHEU-001January 2012  - December 2012
IntroductionThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office (AmFO) of the Department of Interior (DOI) is requesting written offers to purchase Federal Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) produced from the Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU).  BLMs CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas, near the city of Amarillo.
The BLM seeks to enter a NGL transportation and sales agreement for NGL volumes that will be advertised and renewed annually.  The NGL will be available at the tailgate of the Cliffside Helium Extraction unit.  The BLM will produce helium and natural gas in a combined stream from the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir in Potter County, Texas, and separate the products at the CHEU.  The reservoir is about 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas.  The BLM will store the NGL on site for pick up via truck transport by the successful bidder of this agreement.  Buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs.  The BLM estimates the NGL volumes from CHEU will average 1,000 to 3,000 gallons per day, and will remain relatively steady through the 6- to 7-year life of this project.  Pricing of NGL will be based upon current market values tied to a common spot market (such as Conway, Kansas NGL Trading Hub) and the quality of the NGL.  The NGL at the pickup point is a non-fractionated liquid byproduct.  To acquire the full details for applying go to: http://www.blm.gov/nm/amarillo
