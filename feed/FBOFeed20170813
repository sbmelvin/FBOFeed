Synopsis:  The Southeast Louisiana Veterans Healthcare System (SLVHCS) intends to award a sole-source firm fixed price contract for a Roche Ventana Benchmark Special Stainer to Roche Diagnostics Corporation, 9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN 46256-1052 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This contract is for the purchase of equipment (Special Tissue Stainer), installation, training, and warranties on the equipment (standard and extended). The estimated cost of this contract is $55,672.28. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 with a size standard of 1,000 for this procurement. The expected award date for this contract is on or about August 31st, 2017.

The proposed contract is to provide the Anatomic Pathology Section, Southeast Louisiana Veterans Healthcare System (SLVHCS), New Orleans, LA with an additional automated special tissue stainer to produce slides with special stains on biopsy tissue used in Diagnostic Pathology. The purchase of this additional automated special tissue stainer is to add to existing inventories. The Anatomic Pathology Section/Laboratory Medicine Department is currently using Roche Ventana Benchmark Special Stainers for their laboratory operations. Due to increased workload that is expected with the startup/opening of inpatient treatment operations at the facility an additional special tissue stainer is needed to handle this increased workload. A Roche Ventana Benchmark Special Stainer must be purchased to ensure compatibility, consistency, functionality, familiarity, and uniformity with existing equipment. Staff are currently using Roche Ventana Benchmark Special Stainers and are familiar with this piece of equipment (through repeated use and after having received extensive training). Substitute, alternate, and or equivalent products/equipment will not meet mission requirements for the facility. 
The proposed contract is being sole sourced to Roche Diagnostics Corporation because this vendor is the manufacturer and is sole provider of this equipment (to include the installation, training, standard warranty, and extended warranty). As this equipment is proprietary in nature a Roche Ventana Benchmark Special stainer can only be purchased directly from Roche Diagnostics Corporation. Roche Diagnostics Corporation does not allow third party distributors/suppliers of any business size to obtain this equipment for sale/resale to the U.S. Government.
This notice is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOI), proposals, or quotations and no solicitation will be issued.

<SUBJECT>KANAB CREEK RIPARIAN RESTORATION PROJECT - COCONINO COUNTY
<SOLNBR>L17PS01099
<RESPDATE>082517
<ARCHDATE>09092017
<CONTACT>Hetterly, David
<DESC>Background:
The project area encompasses 13,500 acres of BLM-managed public land along Kanab Creek and
associated drainages. Project activities would only occur in the riparian zone where tamarisk and
Russian olive are present (approximately 806 acres). Kanab Creek forms the boundary line between
Coconino and Mohave Counties, Arizona and project activities would take place in both counties. The
north end of the project area is approximately 8.6 miles southwest of Fredonia, Arizona. Included are
21.6 miles of Kanab Creek and approximately 21 miles of ephemeral drainages: Bitter Seeps Wash,
Bulrush Wash, Rock Canyon, Gunsight Canyon, Water Canyon, and several smaller unnamed drainages.
Much of the Kanab Creek riparian corridor has become dominated by non-native tamarisk (Tamarix sp.)
(Also referred to as salt cedar) and Russian olive trees (Elaeagnus angustifolia}. Tamarisk is a shrub or
tree that grows in dense stands at springs, ponds, and along rivers and streams. Tamarisk, introduced
into the U.S. in the 19th century as an erosion control agent, spread throughout the west and has
caused major changes to riparian ecosystems. This prolific non-native displaces native vegetation and
increases fire frequency and severity. Tamarisk spreads by seed and can propagate from buried or
submerged stems. It can replace or displace native woody species, such as cottonwood, willow, and
mesquite, which occupy similar habitats, especially when timing and amount of peak water discharge,
salinity, temperature, and substrate texture have been altered by human activities such as dams or
water diversion. Monotypic stands of tamarisk generally have lower wildlife values compared to stands
of native vegetation. Russian olive, while not as aggressive and disruptive as tamarisk, can displace
native vegetation, especially where it grows in monotypic stands. The purpose of this project is to
remove tamarisk and Russian olive shrubs and trees to facilitate native plant recovery, reduce fire risk,
and improve riparian ecosystem function.
Scope of Work.
This contract would require personnel to remove tamarisk and Russian olive at various sites along a
21.6-mile stretch of Kanab Creek from the Kaibab-Paiute Reservation/BLM boundary in the north to the
confluence with Snake Gulch in the south, and possibly along short sections of side drainages as deemed
necessary. One or more of the following methods would be used for removal, depending on the age of
individual stems, the density of stands, and the degree of intermingling with native vegetation.
Hand-pulling: Personnel could hand pull smaller shrubs and stems from the ground. Hand tools,
including picks, pulaskis, and shovels may be used to loosen the soil surrounding the larger plants and
then the entire root system would be removed.
Basal-bark: This treatment will primarily be used on immature trees under one year in age and up to 3
meters tall. Private contractor employees under the supervision of a person certified by BLM's course
9000-1 will apply Triclopyr- Garlon 3a (near water) or Garlon 4 (away from water on terraces) - using
hand-applicators to the base of the tree at manufacturer-recommended rates.
Cut-stump: This treatment will primarily be used on mature stems. Shrubs and trees along the banks
and on the terraces would be cut or lopped at or near ground level and herbicide will be applied within a
few minutes of cutting. Crews will use chainsaws, hand saws and/or loppers. Private contractor
employees under the supervision of a person certified by BLM's course 9000-1 will apply TriclopyrGarlon
3a or Garlon 4 (depending on distance from water) - using hand-applicators to the cut stems at
manufacturer-recommended rates.
Cut material will be scattered in those areas where only small amounts of material were treated. In
areas of heavier concentrations, cut material will be cut into smaller pieces to facilitate handling. The cut
material will be piled along the edge of the riparian corridor, to be burned after it has cured by BLM
firefighters.
The purpose of this project is to remove tamarisk and Russian olive shrubs and trees to facilitate native
plant recovery, reduce fire risk, and improve riparian ecosystem function.
Special Requirements:
Crews will hike in to Kanab Creek carrying tools and supplies. Pack animals could be utilized to get
supplies into the project area. If necessary, crews are allowed to camp at existing disturbed sites in or
near the project area.
Project activities will be conducted in a manner that would minimize disturbance to existing native
vegetation.
Any cultural {historic/prehistoric site or object) or paleontological resource (fossil remains of plants or
animals) discovered during project activities will immediately be reported to the Arizona Strip Field
Office Manager or his/her designee. All operations in the immediate area of the discovery will be
suspended until written authorization to proceed is issued. An evaluation of the discovery will be made
by a qualified archaeologist or paleontologist to determine appropriate actions to prevent the loss of
significant cultural or scientifically important paleontological values.
If in connection with this work any human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects or objects of
cultural patrimony as defined in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act {P.L. 101-
601; 104 Stat. 3048; 25 U.S.C. 3001) are discovered, operations in the immediate area of the discovery
would stop, the remains and objects would be protected, and the ASFO Manager would be immediately
notified. The immediate area of the discovery would be protected until notified by the ASFO Manager
that operations may resume.
Herbicide application will not occur within¼ mile of an occupied California condor nest, roost, or
release site.
Those involved with project activities will stop work and notify the BLM wildlife team lead if California
condors visit the worksite while project activities are underway. BLM wildlife biologists would determine
if project activities would need to be halted, delayed, or modified in order to avoid any adverse effects
to condors.
The project site and any camping or parking area would be cleaned up at the end of each day the work is
being conducted (e.g., trash removed, scrap materials picked up) to minimize the likelihood of condors
visiting the site. BLM staff may conduct site visits to the area to ensure adequate clean-up measures are
taken.
Project personnel will receive a briefing on the goals and objectives of the treatment, to include
information on sensitive cultural and biological resources in the area. The briefing will include
information on employee and visitor safety.
Project activities will be limited to daylight hours to minimize impacts to wildlife.

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>[List as necessary]</p>
<p>(5) Trade Agreements Certificate. (Applies only if the clause at FAR 52.225-5, Trade Agreements, is included in this solicitation.)</p>
<p>(i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Trade Agreements."</p>
<p>(ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products.</p>
<p>Other End Products</p>
<p>Line Item No.: Country of Origin:</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>[List as necessary]</p>
<p>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>(2) [_] Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]</p>
<p>(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-</p>

<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>52.232-25 -- Prompt Payment (Jul 2013)</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other payment clause in this contract, the Government will make invoice payments under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. The Government considers payment as being made on the day a check is dated or the date of an electronic funds transfer (EFT). Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in sections 2.101, 32.001, and 32.902 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise specified. (However, see subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause concerning payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.)</p>
<p>(a) Invoice payments --</p>
<p>(1) Due date.</p>
<p>(i) Except as indicated in paragraphs (a)(2) and (c) of this clause, the due date for making invoice payments by the designated payment office shall be the later of the following two events:</p>
<p>(A) The 30th day after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the Contractor (except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this clause).</p>
<p>(B) The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed. For a final invoice, when the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance is deemed to occur on the effective date of the contract settlement.</p>
<p>(ii) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date is the 30th day after the date of the Contractor's invoice; provided the designated billing office receives a proper invoice and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.</p>
<p>(2) Certain food products and other payments.</p>
<p>(i) Due dates on Contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, or fish; perishable agricultural commodities; and dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils are --</p>
<p>(A) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182(3)), and as further defined in Pub. L. 98-181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh eggs, and any perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.</p>
<p>(B) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.</p>
<p>(C) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the contract.</p>
<p>(D) For dairy products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)), edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise regarding the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the Contractor making the representation.</p>
<p>(ii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment (e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in the contract.</p>
<p>(3) Contractor's invoice. The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. A proper invoice must include the items listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(x) of this clause. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the designated billing office will return it within 7 days after receipt (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils), with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. The Government will take into account untimely notification when computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor.</p>
<p>(i) Name and address of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(ii) Invoice date and invoice number. (The Contractor should date invoices as close as possible to the date of the mailing or transmission.)</p>
<p>(iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services performed (including order number and contract line item number).</p>
<p>(iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed.</p>
<p>(v) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of shipment, discount for prompt payment terms). Bill of lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government bills of lading.</p>
<p>(vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment).</p>
<p>(vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>(viii) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(ix) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.</p>
<p>(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision (e.g., 52.232-38, Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer), contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic funds Transfer- System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.</p>
<p>(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.</p>
<p>(x) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (e.g.. evidence of shipment.)</p>
<p>(4) Interest penalty. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the designated payment office may make payment on the following working day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.</p>
<p>(i) The designated billing office received a proper invoice.</p>
<p>(ii) The Government processed a receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment, and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.</p>
<p>(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(5) Computing penalty amount. The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p>
<p>(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>
<p>(ii) The prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR 1315.10(c) do not require the Government to pay interest penalties if payment delays are due to disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Government and the Contractor shall resolve claims involving disputes and any interest that may be payable in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes.</p>
<p>(6) Discounts for prompt payment. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if the Government takes a discount for prompt payment improperly. The Government will calculate the interest penalty in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p>
<p>(7) Additional interest penalty.</p>
<p>(i) The designated payment office will pay a penalty amount, calculated in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315 in addition to the interest penalty amount only if--</p>
<p>(A) The Government owes an interest penalty of $1 or more;</p>
<p>(B) The designated payment office does not pay the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and</p>
<p>(C) The Contractor makes a written demand to the designated payment office for additional penalty payment, in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this clause, postmarked no later than 40 days after the invoice amount is paid.</p>
<p>(ii)</p>
<p>(A) The Contractor shall support written demands for additional penalty payments with the following data. The Government will not request any additional data. The Contractor shall --</p>
<p>(1) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required;</p>
<p>(2) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment interest was due; and</p>
<p>(3) State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt.</p>
<p>(B) If there is no postmark or the postmark is illegible--</p>
<p>(1) The designated payment office that receives the demand will annotate it with the date of receipt, provided the demand is received on or before the 40th day after payment was made; or</p>
<p>(2) If the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation, the Government will determine the demand's validity based on the date the Contractor has placed on the demand; provided such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made.</p>
<p>(iii) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by other Government regulations (e.g., payments under utility contracts subject to tariffs and regulation).</p>
<p>(b) Contract financing payments. If this contract provides for contract financing, the Government will make contract financing payments in accordance with the applicable contract financing clause.</p>
<p>(c) Fast payment procedure due dates. If this contract contains the clause at 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, payments will be made within 15 days after the date of receipt of the invoice.</p>
<p>(d) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall-</p>
<p>(1) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-</p>
<p>(i) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);</p>
<p>(ii) Affected contract number and delivery order number if applicable;</p>
<p>(iii) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and</p>
<p>(iv) Contractor point of contact.</p>

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.232-25 -- Prompt Payment (Jul 2013)</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other payment clause in this contract, the Government will make invoice payments under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. The Government considers payment as being made on the day a check is dated or the date of an electronic funds transfer (EFT). Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in sections 2.101, 32.001, and 32.902 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise specified. (However, see subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause concerning payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.)</p>
<p>(a) Invoice payments --</p>
<p>(1) Due date.</p>
<p>(i) Except as indicated in paragraphs (a)(2) and (c) of this clause, the due date for making invoice payments by the designated payment office shall be the later of the following two events:</p>
<p>(A) The 30th day after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the Contractor (except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this clause).</p>
<p>(B) The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed. For a final invoice, when the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance is deemed to occur on the effective date of the contract settlement.</p>
<p>(ii) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date is the 30th day after the date of the Contractor's invoice; provided the designated billing office receives a proper invoice and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.</p>
<p>(2) Certain food products and other payments.</p>
<p>(i) Due dates on Contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, or fish; perishable agricultural commodities; and dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils are --</p>
<p>(A) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182(3)), and as further defined in Pub. L. 98-181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh eggs, and any perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.</p>
<p>(B) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.</p>
<p>(C) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the contract.</p>
<p>(D) For dairy products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)), edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise regarding the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the Contractor making the representation.</p>
<p>(ii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment (e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in the contract.</p>
<p>(3) Contractor's invoice. The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. A proper invoice must include the items listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(x) of this clause. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the designated billing office will return it within 7 days after receipt (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils), with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. The Government will take into account untimely notification when computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor.</p>
<p>(i) Name and address of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(ii) Invoice date and invoice number. (The Contractor should date invoices as close as possible to the date of the mailing or transmission.)</p>
<p>(iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services performed (including order number and contract line item number).</p>
<p>(iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed.</p>
<p>(v) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of shipment, discount for prompt payment terms). Bill of lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government bills of lading.</p>
<p>(vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment).</p>
<p>(vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>(viii) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(ix) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.</p>
<p>(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision (e.g., 52.232-38, Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer), contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic funds Transfer- System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.</p>
<p>(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.</p>
<p>(x) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (e.g.. evidence of shipment.)</p>
<p>(4) Interest penalty. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the designated payment office may make payment on the following working day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.</p>
<p>(i) The designated billing office received a proper invoice.</p>
<p>(ii) The Government processed a receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment, and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.</p>
<p>(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(5) Computing penalty amount. The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p>
<p>(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>
<p>(ii) The prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR 1315.10(c) do not require the Government to pay interest penalties if payment delays are due to disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Government and the Contractor shall resolve claims involving disputes and any interest that may be payable in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes.</p>
<p>(6) Discounts for prompt payment. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if the Government takes a discount for prompt payment improperly. The Government will calculate the interest penalty in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p>
<p>(7) Additional interest penalty.</p>
<p>(i) The designated payment office will pay a penalty amount, calculated in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315 in addition to the interest penalty amount only if--</p>
<p>(A) The Government owes an interest penalty of $1 or more;</p>
<p>(B) The designated payment office does not pay the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and</p>
<p>(C) The Contractor makes a written demand to the designated payment office for additional penalty payment, in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this clause, postmarked no later than 40 days after the invoice amount is paid.</p>
<p>(ii)</p>
<p>(A) The Contractor shall support written demands for additional penalty payments with the following data. The Government will not request any additional data. The Contractor shall --</p>
<p>(1) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required;</p>
<p>(2) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment interest was due; and</p>
<p>(3) State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt.</p>
<p>(B) If there is no postmark or the postmark is illegible--</p>
<p>(1) The designated payment office that receives the demand will annotate it with the date of receipt, provided the demand is received on or before the 40th day after payment was made; or</p>
<p>(2) If the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation, the Government will determine the demand's validity based on the date the Contractor has placed on the demand; provided such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made.</p>
<p>(iii) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by other Government regulations (e.g., payments under utility contracts subject to tariffs and regulation).</p>
<p>(b) Contract financing payments. If this contract provides for contract financing, the Government will make contract financing payments in accordance with the applicable contract financing clause.</p>
<p>(c) Fast payment procedure due dates. If this contract contains the clause at 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, payments will be made within 15 days after the date of receipt of the invoice.</p>
<p>(d) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall-</p>
<p>(1) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-</p>
<p>(i) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);</p>
<p>(ii) Affected contract number and delivery order number if applicable;</p>
<p>(iii) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and</p>
<p>(iv) Contractor point of contact.</p>
<p>(2) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>(2) [_] Outside the United States.</p>

<p>(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-</p>

<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.232-25 -- Prompt Payment (Jul 2013)</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other payment clause in this contract, the Government will make invoice payments under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. The Government considers payment as being made on the day a check is dated or the date of an electronic funds transfer (EFT). Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in sections 2.101, 32.001, and 32.902 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise specified. (However, see subparagraph (a)(4) of this clause concerning payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.)</p>
<p>(a) Invoice payments --</p>
<p>(1) Due date.</p>
<p>(i) Except as indicated in paragraphs (a)(2) and (c) of this clause, the due date for making invoice payments by the designated payment office shall be the later of the following two events:</p>
<p>(A) The 30th day after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the Contractor (except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this clause).</p>
<p>(B) The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed. For a final invoice, when the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance is deemed to occur on the effective date of the contract settlement.</p>
<p>(ii) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date is the 30th day after the date of the Contractor's invoice; provided the designated billing office receives a proper invoice and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.</p>
<p>(2) Certain food products and other payments.</p>
<p>(i) Due dates on Contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, or fish; perishable agricultural commodities; and dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils are --</p>
<p>(A) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182(3)), and as further defined in Pub. L. 98-181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh eggs, and any perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.</p>
<p>(B) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7th day after product delivery.</p>
<p>(C) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the contract.</p>
<p>(D) For dairy products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4502(e)), edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10th day after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise regarding the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the Contractor making the representation.</p>
<p>(ii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment (e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in the contract.</p>
<p>(3) Contractor's invoice. The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. A proper invoice must include the items listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(x) of this clause. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the designated billing office will return it within 7 days after receipt (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils), with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. The Government will take into account untimely notification when computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor.</p>
<p>(i) Name and address of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(ii) Invoice date and invoice number. (The Contractor should date invoices as close as possible to the date of the mailing or transmission.)</p>
<p>(iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services performed (including order number and contract line item number).</p>
<p>(iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed.</p>
<p>(v) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of shipment, discount for prompt payment terms). Bill of lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government bills of lading.</p>
<p>(vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment).</p>
<p>(vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>(viii) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(ix) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.</p>
<p>(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision (e.g., 52.232-38, Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer), contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic funds Transfer- System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.</p>
<p>(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.</p>
<p>(x) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (e.g.. evidence of shipment.)</p>
<p>(4) Interest penalty. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the designated payment office may make payment on the following working day without incurring a late payment interest penalty.</p>
<p>(i) The designated billing office received a proper invoice.</p>
<p>(ii) The Government processed a receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment, and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.</p>
<p>(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(5) Computing penalty amount. The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p>
<p>(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>
<p>(ii) The prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR 1315.10(c) do not require the Government to pay interest penalties if payment delays are due to disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Government and the Contractor shall resolve claims involving disputes and any interest that may be payable in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes.</p>
<p>(6) Discounts for prompt payment. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if the Government takes a discount for prompt payment improperly. The Government will calculate the interest penalty in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p>
<p>(7) Additional interest penalty.</p>
<p>(i) The designated payment office will pay a penalty amount, calculated in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315 in addition to the interest penalty amount only if--</p>
<p>(A) The Government owes an interest penalty of $1 or more;</p>
<p>(B) The designated payment office does not pay the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and</p>
<p>(C) The Contractor makes a written demand to the designated payment office for additional penalty payment, in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this clause, postmarked no later than 40 days after the invoice amount is paid.</p>
<p>(ii)</p>
<p>(A) The Contractor shall support written demands for additional penalty payments with the following data. The Government will not request any additional data. The Contractor shall --</p>
<p>(1) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required;</p>
<p>(2) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment interest was due; and</p>
<p>(3) State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt.</p>
<p>(B) If there is no postmark or the postmark is illegible--</p>
<p>(1) The designated payment office that receives the demand will annotate it with the date of receipt, provided the demand is received on or before the 40th day after payment was made; or</p>
<p>(2) If the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation, the Government will determine the demand's validity based on the date the Contractor has placed on the demand; provided such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made.</p>
<p>(iii) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by other Government regulations (e.g., payments under utility contracts subject to tariffs and regulation).</p>
<p>(b) Contract financing payments. If this contract provides for contract financing, the Government will make contract financing payments in accordance with the applicable contract financing clause.</p>
<p>(c) Fast payment procedure due dates. If this contract contains the clause at 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, payments will be made within 15 days after the date of receipt of the invoice.</p>
<p>(d) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall-</p>
<p>(1) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-</p>
<p>(i) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);</p>
<p>(ii) Affected contract number and delivery order number if applicable;</p>
<p>(iii) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and</p>
<p>(iv) Contractor point of contact.</p>
<p>(2) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.</p>
