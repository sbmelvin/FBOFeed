<DESC>The anticipated award date will be: 14JUN2007 Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation.  Description The government intends to negotiate multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with qualified sources in order to competitively award BPA calls for repair requirements under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) from July 2007 through June 2008.  Respondents to this synopsis will be provided a request for quotation (RFQ) for a price list to include the respondent's best price for all of the items for which they are an approved repair source.  A respondent may at anytime attempt to become a qualified repair source for an item listed below, by following the applicable procedure.  If more than one BPA is established with small business entities for an individual National Stock Number (NSN), repair requirements for that NSN will be set-aside for small business. Responding to this synopsis in no manner guarantees a BPA with will be negotiated with the respondent.  The establishment of a BPA with a respondent in no way obligates the government to issue any calls against the BPA.  The estimated total dollar amount for all calls issued in the 12 month duration of the BPA is $2.5 Million.  Individual BPA calls will not exceed the SAT ($100,000).  All interested parties should contact Douglas Hansen by phone at (801) 586-1225, or by email at douglas.hansen@hil.af.mil, or Brenda Collard at (801) 586-3358,  or brenda.collard@hill.af.mil.

<DESC>1.	Is this a new procurement?  Who is the incumbent?
No. The incumbent is James Ferrando.
2.	The solicitation states that the period of performance is from July 1, 2007 ? June 30, 2008 ? are these dates the project start and end dates? (as compared to the timeline in the solicitation that starts Aug 1, 2007 and ends April 30, 2008)? I?m assuming that from July 1, 2007 until the timeline start of Aug. 1, 2007 is a ramp-up time? And after the timeline date of April 30, 2008 and until June 30, 2008, that is the project wrap-up and closeout time? 
Correct.
3.	Will all work occur in one location? Or, will travel be required? Is all within walking distance? 
Work is performed throughout the Nation Capital Region.
4.	All work will occur on-site? Or, if it makes sense, can some of the work take place off-site? 
All work is not required to be performed on-site.

No.
7.	These campaigns have taken place in the past ? can you tell me if this is typically a small project team? Or, one lone consultant? 
Each offeror shall propose staff as deemed appropriate.  Historically, the contractor works as one lone consultant during the ramp-up and then has additional team members during the training and monitoring period.
8.	In order to help determine if this is a one person project or whether it will require more than one consultant, can you tell me how many HHS OPDIV heads there are that we would need to work with? 
The contractor shall work with all HHS OPDIVs and STAFFDIVs within the National Capital Region.  Please visit www.hhs.gov to see a listing of offices.

No.  Options shall be proposed to be considered for award.
11.	Task 1 ? Where are HHS OPDIV heads and coordinators located? And, how many are there?
They are located throughout the National Capital Region.  The exact number is unknown, due to size and/or location of the OPDIV/STAFFDIV.  Please visit www.hhs.gov to see a listing of offices.
12.	Task 3 - At what location does the CFC Campaign Leadership Conference take place? And when does that take place? (Hopefully early on ? since it appears most of the information required on the campaign will be provided at this conference). 
Historically, the initial Campaign leadership conference takes place in the Hubert H. Humphrey Building and continues weekly through out the campaign at conference rooms in the Switzer Building and the Parklawn Building in Rockville.
1.	Are campaign related materials provided free of charge? 
All campaign related materials are provided by the contractor.  Some of the materials are provided by the CFC National Capital Area Committee, others by Global Impact, some by the Charities, and others are developed by contractor staff.
13.	Task 4 ? How many keyworkers representing every element of HHS are there typically? And, where are the keyworkers located? 
Historically, there are 3,200 keyworkers throughout the National Capital Region.  
1.	We just need to facilitate the training? Do the ?Loaned Executives? carry out the training? Or, does someone else? Or, do we need to conduct the training? 
Loaned Executives and OPDIVs and STAFFDIVs provide limited amount of training.  The contractor is required to provide the remainder.
14.	Task 8 ? Facilitate Secretary?s Commitment Rally ? this is just a coordination task ? there are no costs associated with it? 
Correct.
15.	You stated in the original solicitation ?Offerors are encouraged to propose incentives for exceeding goals set by the Department and disincentives for not attaining the goals? ? can you tell us what the ?goals? are? It would be impossible to provide incentives or disincentives with this knowledge.
