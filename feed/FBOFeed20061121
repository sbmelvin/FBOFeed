<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to procure twenty (20) moving target simulators (MTS), SierraCom part number G432082-1.  The MTS is a subsystem of the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) consisting of a weather-tight electronics box attached to a parabolic reflector, a feed assembly and mount assembly.  The MTS is intended for use as a calibration standard for the TDWR.  The MTS provides a simulated weather target cross-section that allows the TDWR system to meet calibration requirements and perform a self-check to determine out-of-tolerance faults. A one-time firm, fixed price contract is anticipated to accomplish this procurement.  These moving target simulators are only known to be available from Microwave Engineering Corporation, North Andover, MA, because they own the complete drawing package for these items that were originally designed and manufactured by SierraCom.  The Government does not have the test capability, evaluation criteria, or technical documentation available to allow other sources to manufacture these items.  To receive consideration as a potential source, any other concern must provide in writing a complete set of system specification drawings, all required standards and testing specifications, test plans, part lists, and proof of rights to use the data.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.   Documentation must be received by the FAA, NAS Contracting Team (AMQ-210), 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73125, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, December 4, 2006.  Hand-carried responses (or responses sent by overnight delivery) shall be delivered to Room 313 of the Multi-Purpose Building located at 6500 South MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169.  Responses must be sealed and labeled as follows:  Connie Houpt, Market Survey No. DTFAAC-07-R-51165; due 2:00 p.m. CST, December 4, 2006.  Documentation must include name and telephone number of a point of contact.    Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further acquisition action by the Government.  Any information received as a result of this announcement will not be provided to other contractors and will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The final determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Scope: The title of this program is Deployable & Renewable Energy Alternative Module (DREAM).  This is part of a larger requirement for renewable energy sources, but is addressing a specific size of capability only at this time.  The offerors solution for the DREAM shall address the requirements of the attached Statement of Objectives (SOO). With the exception of Critical Performance Parameters (CPP) specified in the SOO that are non-tradable, all other requirements are tradable within the construct of best value approach to meeting the highest level of system capability. Failure to satisfy ALL CPPs will render a solution unacceptable. Intended Use: The DREAM is one of several items in the USMC family of power generation sources and alternative power sources. The key application for this power supply is remote operation in austere environments, with simplicity of use. Characteristics: The CPPs for the DREAM are as follows:  „X	Shall provide three (3) kilowatt (kW) (CPP) to 5 kW (OBJECTIVE) output electric power at any time during a given 12 hour period (CPP) to 48 hour period (OBJECTIVE);  „X	The Light Tactical Trailer, Heavy Chassis (LTT-HC), NSN 2330-01-387-5424 shall be the trailer upon which the DREAM is mounted (CPP).   „X	Shall be capable of sustained operation at up to 95¢XF at 4000 feet above sea level (CPP). Contract Structure:  The Government anticipates issuing multiple initial contracts to successful offerors. This program utilizes a refining system concept structure, of three program phases, as follows: The Base Contract will be for Phase 1 efforts.  Up to three contractors may be selected for award. This phase has a 3-month duration. Analytical efforts will constitute Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001.  CLIN 0001 will be a Time and Material CLIN with a Not-To-Exceed (NTE) cost for this phase of $75,000 per contractor.  Data items as detailed in the SOO will constitute CLIN 0002. CLIN 0002 will be Not Separately Priced (NSP). Based on the results of Phase 1, the Government may exercise up to two options for the performance of Phase 2.  Only contractors from Phase 1 will be considered for Phase 2.  Phase 2 has an 8 month duration and is for detailed design, hardware fabrication, and contractor check-out testing.  CLIN 0002 will be a Time and Material CLIN with a Not-To-Exceed (NTE) cost for this phase of $400,000 per contractor. Analytical and hardware efforts will constitute CLIN 0003.  Data items as detailed in the SOO will constitute CLIN 0004. CLIN 0004 will be Not Separately Priced (NSP). Based on the results of Phase 2, the Government may exercise up to two options for the performance of Phase 3.  Only contractors from Phase 2 will be considered for Phase 3.  This phase has a 5-month duration and is for support to Government testing and system maturation.  CLIN 0005 will be a Time and Material CLIN with a Not-To-Exceed (NTE) cost for this phase of $250,000 per contractor. Analytical and hardware efforts will constitute CLIN 0005.  Data items as detailed in the SOO will constitute CLIN 0006. CLIN 0006 will be Not Separately Priced (NSP). Alternative schedules may be proposed if they offer clear benefit to the Government for decreased cost or more rapid development in support of demonstration. Follow-on contractual efforts for additional systems to support operational uses or subsequent testing are envisioned to be procured under a sole-source arrangement to a final selected contractor from Phase 3 contractors that delivered and supported previous and representative hardware systems. Verification: Unless otherwise specified, the offeror is responsible for the execution of all inspections and certifications related to conformance and performance of the DREAM and all components.      Packaging: Best commercial practices.      Commercial Warranty: Warranty provisions or exclusions shall be clearly stated in the offerors' proposal submission.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations. FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation w!  ill contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company¡¦s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather inf!  ormation you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the offici al version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam!   Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B.

<DESC>Section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take the necessary steps between now and 2011 to implement Medicare Contracting Reform (MCR).  MCR will bring standard contracting principles to Medicare such as competition and performance incentives.  These basic contracting principles, which have been applied to other federal programs under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), have been missing from the Medicare contracting environment.  CMS is required to replace the current contracting authority under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with the new Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority.  The law directs CMS to conduct full and open competitions for new MACs, that will perform the work currently being handled by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, regional home health intermediaries, and durable medical equipment regional carriers in administering the Medicare fee-for-service program.  As such, CMS anticipates conducting full and open competition for the Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractors (A/B MAC) for Jurisdiction 1 (comprised of the states of California, Nevada, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and Hawaii), Jurisdiction 2 (comprised of the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska), Jurisdiction 7 (comprised of the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi) and Jurisdiction 13 (comprised of the states of New York and Connecticut).

The A/B MAC will provide specified fee-for-service health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, for most all institutional health care as well as for providers.  It is anticipated that this competition will result in award of four, stand-alone A/B MAC contracts.  These contracts will include a base year and four, one-year options.  Any questions should be directed to Desiree Wheeler, Contract Specialist, at (410) 786-2404, or by sending an e-mail to Desiree.Wheeler@cms.hhs.gov.  E-mail communications should include company name and size (Large/Small), address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers.  Any additional information and documents about this announcement will be posted on FedBizzOpps.  CMS anticipates releasing the Request For Proposal on or about December 15, 2006.

<SUBJECT>A -- Respiratory Distress in Newborns and Its Relationship to Group B Streptococcal Colonization
<SOLNBR>RFPNICHD-2007-03
<RESPDATE>021507
<ARCHDATE>03022007
<CONTACT>Lynn Salo, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-435-6962, Fax 301-402-3676, Email ls59u@nih.gov
<DESC>Background: The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a need for clinical centers to participate in a clinical study relating respiratory distress in newborns to group B streptococcal colonization.  Phospholipids from group B streptococcal (GBS) cell wall cause pulmonary hypertension in experimental animals. When exposed to penicillin, Streptococcus mutans releases phospholipids immediately.  Preliminary data from a NICHD multi center study have shown that 8.8% newborns colonized by GBS at birth had signs of respiratory distress within 48 hours after birth (cases). In 60% of the cases, oxygen supplementation was used, in 5% mechanical ventilation was required, and in 2% persistent pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed. Compared with light colonization, heavy colonization increased the rate of respiratory distress 1.73 fold, a discharge diagnosis of respiratory disorder 2.02 fold, a blood/CSF obtained for culture 1.54 fold and antibiotic administration after birth 1.87 fold. Penicillin use during labor was associated with a 2.62 fold increase in respiratory distress in the colonized newborn.  These findings support the association of neonatal respiratory distress with ?asymptomatic? GBS colonization and with penicillin use during labor.   We hypothesize that newborns colonized with GBS receive bacterial phospholipids leading to pulmonary hypertension and respiratory distress, especially in the situation of newborns of penicillin-treated mothers.  Objective: The proposed study aims to relate the levels of serum bacterial phospholipids to the occurrence of respiratory distress in newborns of mothers colonized by GBS. The study will examine the pathologic effects of ?asymptomatic? carriage of GBS and the effects of penicillin during labor on the occurrence of respiratory distress in newborns.  Scope: It is estimated that ~320 newborns of > 32 weeks gestation with respiratory distress within 24 hours after birth and ~1600 mothers who are GBS carriers will need to be recruited within 12 months.  To achieve that, about 8,000 mothers of >32 weeks gestation will be cultured for GBS carriage by obtaining vaginal and rectal swabs on admission to the labor and delivery room. Their newborns will be swabbed from 4 surface sites (throat, anus, ears and umbilicus) shortly after birth before the first bath to identify those who are colonized with GBS [and those who are not].  Maternal and cord blood samples will be collected from a random sample of 10% of newborns born to colonized mothers (about 160 newborns) and an equal number of non-colonized randomly selected newborns, penicillin treated and untreated groups(130 samples from each group).  A 0.25 mL blood sample designated for this study will be collected from newborns with respiratory distress at the time of illness and from asymptomatic newborns (controls) at the time of metabolic screening with a case:control ratio of 1:1. Medical records of the symptomatic newborns and the controls, penicillin treated and untreated mothers and newborns; and selected newborns of colonized and non-colonized mothers will be reviewed for demographic, clinical and epidemiological characteristics.  The Request for Proposals, RFP NICHD-2007-03 will be available on or about November 24, 2006 at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  All responsible organizations are encouraged to submit a proposal that will be due February 15, 2007.  This requirement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Only electronic copies of the solicitation will be available.

Solicitation RFQ-GA-07-00012 is issued as a Commercial Solicitation using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR Part 13.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code  is 339111.  The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer best conforms to the specification, meets the Government's delivery schedule and is the most cost effective in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria below.  This  solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those that are in effect through the latest Federal Acquisition Circular.   The contractor shall provide BGI, Inc equipment or equal in accordance with the following specifications.  ITEM 1 - PQlOO Portable Air Sampler with charger,  cables, and software (PN PQ100) - 10 each ?  These samplers are specifically used to sample ambient air for asbestos fibers. The portable air sampler must sample from 2 to 25 LPM, include a microprocessor controlled mass-flow system, be fully programmable to run and stop, contain a digital  interface, store run data, be precise to +/- 2%, have the capability to operate on external power (deep cycle marine battery), and handle the extreme pressure drop (25mmHg) created by the use of an AHERA 0.45um TEM filter. The low flow requirement is essential to meet the requirements for 24-hour  ambient air sampling which is much lower than traditional asbestos sampling. The 0.45um filter with an 8um back filter used for TEM analysis must be able to handle a pressure drop of greater than 25mmHg unloaded over extended continuous use. The sampler must be powered using an external 12V deep  cycle 12V marine battery running at a flow rate of 2 LPM, and running under these conditions for at least 6 months, which is an absolute requirement because power is not readily available in remote sampling locations.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is  RFQ-OH-07-00034.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated as a result of this 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541620, size standard $6.5 million.   Background The  Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants.  NAAQS consist of a primary standard that is protective of human health and a secondary standard that is protective of human welfare (the environment). As part of the NAAQS  review process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air Quality  Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is in the process of reviewing the secondary NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) in a combined SA that will review the state of knowledge of both criteria air pollutants.  The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for NOx and SOx  is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established by the federal court.  EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the secondary NAAQS for NOx and SOx.  EPA's  proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the NOx/SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen and sulfur oxides will be reviewed and summarized in a Science  Assessment Support Document (SASD) and integrated and synthesized in the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors' review meeting sponsored by the EPA. The draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer-review draft that will be vetted at a  peer-review meeting.  Peer-review comments will be incorporated into the draft final SASD.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is  RFQ-OH-07-00036.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm-fixed price purchase order is anticipated as a result of this 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541620, size standard $6.5 million.   Background The  Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants.  NAAQS consist of a primary standard that is protective of human health and a secondary standard that is protective of human welfare (the environment). As part of the NAAQS  review process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air Quality  Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is in the process of reviewing the secondary NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) in a combined SA that will review the state of knowledge of both criteria air pollutants.  The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for NOx and SOx  is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established by the federal court.  EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the secondary NAAQS for NOx and SOx.  EPA's  proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the NOx/SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the NOx/SOx SA by November 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen and sulfur oxides will be reviewed and summarized in a Science  Assessment Support Document (SASD) and integrated and synthesized in the Integrated Science Assessment (ISA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors' review meeting sponsored by the EPA. The draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer-review draft that will be vetted at a  peer-review meeting.  Peer-review comments will be incorporated into the draft final SASD.  From the revised SASD, the SA will be prepared as an external review draft for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for public comment.   EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the NOx/SOx ISA for public and CASAC review before completion of the final document.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Two versions of the EDS have been developed by NSCMP:  the EDS Phase 1 (P1) and the EDS Phase 2 (P2).  The EDS P2 version is designed to handle chemical items with an explosive force of up to the equivalent of 4.8 pounds of TNT.  Under this solicitation, t he contractor will furnish all materials (except where government-furnished) and labor for the fabrication, assembly, inspection, and testing of one (1) new EDS P2 Series.  Inspection, testing, and acceptance of the unit will be in accordance with the gove rnment-provided acceptance test plan and will be conducted in two stages, at the contractors facility and then by government personnel at a government facility.

The government will provide answers to any industry's comments and/or questions and/or amendments to the solicitation via the same electronic means.     The RFP will contain complex requirements, extensive integration and coordination efforts, and significant environmental and safety matters.  The basis of award is anticipated to be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable to the Government.  The resulting, ant icipated contract type is a firm-fixed-price.  The RFP is anticipated to be structured for one award, based on a two-step, lowest price technically acceptable approach, as described below. Under Step 1, selection of an offeror will be based on an evaluation of the proposals in two areas: Technical/Management and Past Performance. The Technical evaluation criteria will focus on evaluation requirements and the ability of contractor personnel t o meet the standards with acceptable quality levels. The Management evaluation will assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed management approach. The Past Performance proposal will include the offerors past performance on contracts of simil ar size, scope, and complexity to assess performance risk for this project.  No pricing information will be considered during Step 1.  Only contractors who have been determined acceptable in the technical and past performance areas will be allowed to submi t a cost proposal under Step 2.  The corresponding instructions to offerors and evaluation basis and criteria will be contained in Sections L and M, respectively, of the RFP.   The TDP contains approximately 830 drawings and 27 specifications.  A significant amount of government-furnished equipment will be provided.  The TDP will be available, on two CDs, upon issuance of the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>R--Temporary Personnel in Support of FEMA Temporary Roofing Mission in the Event of Hurricanes in the State of FL, Puerto Rico or the US Virgin Islands for Rights of Entry Mission
<SOLNBR>W912EP-06-R-0025
<RESPDATE>092006
<CONTACT>Brenda Martin, 904-232-3820
<DESC>Introduction.  Soon after land strike from a hurricane, US Army Corps of Engineers may be asked to assist FEMA in a temporary roofing mission.  Once the mission is declared then US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) will be activated to begin the roofin g mission.  One aspect of the temporary roofing mission includes acquiring Right of Entry (ROE) forms from home owners in need of temporary roofs.  This scope of work is written to accomplish the ROE mission. Main effort is in declared counties impacted from the hurricane(s) and could extend to smaller outlying counties.  In addition, effort may include Puerto and/or the US Virgin Islands.  Collecting ROEs.  In order to efficiently obtain ROE forms for as many home owners in need, the Corps will be setting up collection sites throughout the damaged areas and advertise via radio, television, word of mouth, press releases, and other venues.  T he Corps will be involved in setting up these collection sites and will be awarding task orders from a contractor to provide temporary personnel that, once trained, can run these sites as well as open and close these sites throughout the mission with or wi thout Corps personnel.  Each collection site will typically have 2 or more individuals at each site.  There also may be a need to canvass designated locations throughout the declared areas which will include knocking on doors and explaining the temporary r oofing mission to those in need.  The contractor shall provide up to 100 individuals (those hired by the contractor) to assist in the ROE mission for the Corps Blue Roof Program in the areas affected by a hurricane which makes landfall in Florida, Puerto Rico, and/or the Virgin Islands.  In addition, the COR may request one administration support person to assist with spreadsheets, power point presentations, and word processing as requested.  Work could begin as soon as 24 hours after a storm makes landfal l but not later than 72 hours after landfall.  Work hours will be scheduled by the on-site COR, but are anticipated to be from 7:00 a.m. until 7:30 p.m. (up to 12 hours per day).  It is important to note that these individuals must be very flexible and w illing to work hard to accomplish the mission.  It is possible that one or more of the individuals will be requested to work at one collection site one day and then asked to move to another collection site the following day.  Collection sites will be openi ng and closing on nearly a daily basis, so the need for individuals to support this effort may decrease and increase within a 24 hour notice.  If it is determined by the Corps that an individual or individuals are incompetent and/or ineffective, then the C orps will request the contractor to remove this person within 8 hours of notice.  Each individual shall have their own transportation and are responsible for their own food and lodging.  One cell phone will be required by each individual.  On a case by cas e basis, Government cell phones may be issued to individuals for use during this mission.  Personal phone calls to friends and/or family will not be reimbursed.  Depending on the location/county in which the emergency temporary roofing is declared, the ind ividuals hired by the contractor may be required to be bilingual (one of which includes English).  Numbers of needed bilingual individuals will be determined by COR once the ROE mission begins.  For example, if Puerto Rico is in the strike of the hurricane  and the Corps is given a roofing mission, the Corps will be requesting that 100 percent speak both Spanish and English.  If the strike is located along the Panhandle, there may not be a need for anyone to be bilingual.  Individuals are required to read, w rite, and have the stamina to stand outside in extremely hot conditions.  These individuals must have high school diploma or equivalent.  The contractor shall be capable of increasing the workforce by 25% within a 24 hour notice.  The contractor should mak e their best effort in hiring local labor within impacted areas.  ROE forms shall be provided by the Government.  The reporting location(s) will be determined by the COR.  The Corps may request individuals to travel an excess of 100 miles when needed to drop off ROE forms or supplies and may include travel outside of the county in which the individual resides. Data Entry for ROEs.  In addition to the previous 100 individuals requested from the contractor, up to an additional 25 individuals will be needed for data entry to work during the night from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am.  These individuals must be able to type 40 or more words per minute and have basic understanding of computer skills such as database entry.  This will include entering ROE data into the database as well as organizing and filing ROE forms.  Work hours must be flexible.  The majority of this work wil l be input during the night; however, a fewer number of individuals will be needed to support Data Entry during the day with a 24 hour notice throughout the mission. Phone Bank for ROEs.  Up to 20 individuals will be needed to support phone calls from the public related to the ROE mission.  Corps will have designated phone bank locations setup to be used with a toll free number to answer all questions related to this mission.  Typical hours of operation will be 7:00 am until 7:30 pm (up to 12 hours per day).  Training.  On-site training will be provided by Corps employees before initiation of work. Period of Performance.  Estimated period of performance is 30 days. The government intends to award a fixed price indefinite quantity contract for these services for one year with four one-year options. The total ceiling price of the contract, with options, will be $5,000,000.00.  This acquisition is 100% set-aside for sma ll business under NAICS 561320, the size standard of which is $12.5 Million.

<SUBJECT>A -- TOPICAL BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (TBAA) ? In-Ground Fiber Optic Sensor Systems for Detection, Classification, and Localization of Explosions, Explosive Device Placement, and Border Intrusions
<SOLNBR>BAA-070334
<RESPDATE>121106

<CONTACT>Nancy Howard, Contract Negotiator, Phone 401-832-1545, Fax 401-832-4820, Email howardns@npt.nuwc.navy.mil
<DESC>This is an amendment to Topical Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for In-Ground Fiber Optic Sensor Systems for Detection, Classification, and Localization of Explosions, Explosive Device Placement, and Border Intrusions, BAA #070334.  This amendment is intended to clarify questions concerning schedule and funding issues. This BAA is concerned primarily with Phase II of the overall fiber-optic sensing program.  Phase II focuses on the evaluation of mature, candidate sensors and system technologies, and on the selection of the single sensor that will be used in the final end-to-end system demonstration in Phase IV.  The anticipated timeline for Phase II is December 2006 to May 2007, with two sub-phases.  In the first sub-phase (December 2006 to February 2007), the sensor and system technologies proposed under this BAA will be evaluated using existing vendor-supplied specifications and test results. The goal will be the selection of fiber-optic sensors with associated signal processing for further in-ground testing.  Up to six (6) sensors may be selected in this sub-phase for further testing.  NOTE: The original BAA synopsis discussed the pre-selection of six (6) sensors for bench-top testing, from which the three sensors would be selected for in-ground testing.  Issues have been raised concerning the usefulness of such bench-top tests, however, such that the pre-selection and bench-top testing portion of the BAA has been eliminated to allow a more focused effort on the in-ground testing.  In the second sub-phase (March to May 2007), the sensors selected in the first sub-phase will be subjected to a side-by-side in-ground comparison test at a location to be determined (most likely on the NUWC campus or nearby).  This test will focus on a short section (nominally 300 feet) of in-ground fiber, possibly with an on-spool lead to simulate conditions at the end of a longer fiber. Also, these preliminary tests will focus on the fiber-optic sensor, front-end electronics, signal processing, and detector, and NOT on event classification and localization.  The most important performance metrics for this phase are detection performance and aural reproduction capability.  Funding may be made available to selected vendors to supply a prototype sensor and support testing (NOTE: The government does NOT intend to retain sensor systems after testing is complete). It is anticipated that funding of approximately $50K to 100K will be available for each selected vendor to support the preliminary in-ground testing.  The results of this side-by-side test will be used to select a single sensor system for the final in-ground demonstration to be held at a location to be determined (most likely Yuma, AZ) in the July/August 2007 time frame.  The Phase IV demonstration will be a complete end-to-end test, including sensor, electronics, front-end processing, and detection, classification, and localization capabilities.  The sensor system selected for this test will be purchased by the government.  Funding of approximately $100K to 200K will be made available under this project for the system purchase and test support. The BAA also calls for systems technologies such as classification and localization algorithms for FO sensing systems.  Any technologies proposed along these lines will be evaluated separately from the FO sensor system itself (if it is proposed with a sensor).  If selected, such technologies would be folded into the automation algorithm development portion (Phase III) of the overall program, which will be executed in the period from March to June 2007.  Potential funding for these types of technologies will likely be limited to an order of $100K, although higher funding levels could be available for well-demonstrated, well-documented, outstanding DCL system (i.e., if a proposed set of DCL functions are so outstanding that further in-house development is not required).

Questions of a security or contracting nature shall be submitted to the appropriate POC listed below.  Questions received after 15 November 2006 may be responded to at the sole discretion of the Government.

POC
1.	Technical POC: Dr. Monte Turner, DARPA/STO

2.	Security POC: Richard Kirkwood, DARPA/STO/Security, 3701 Fairfax Dr., Arlington, VA 22203.

3.	Contracting POC (COTR): Dr. Brad Libbey, NVESD, 10221 Burbeck Rd., Ft. Belvoir, VA, 22060

Information announcing an updating this BAA and PIP is published on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov, the SAVi Program website at http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicitations/BAA07-02/index.html.  Other material, such as SAVi Program updates, will be available through the SAVi Program website.

C.	Government Furnished Information (GFI):
1.	Data/Materials from Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC): The use of support, data, materials, or equipment (GFI/GFE/GFP) from an FFRDC may be available upon request.

2.	Each offeror shall include, in the Cost/Business Volume of its proposal, a contract clause, which will be incorporated in the offeror?s contract if selected, governing its interface with an FFRDC during performance of the contract.  This clause shall capture the offeror?s intended scope of interface with the FFRDC, and specifically identify any support, data, materials, or equipment it will require to be provided as GFI/GFE/GFP.  The clause shall also specify that the contractor?s responsibility for contract and system performance shall not be diminished in any respect by any GFI/GFE/GFP that may be provided by the Government or any FFRDC during performance of the contract.

D.	Organizational Conflict of Interest
Each cost proposal shall contain a section satisfying the requirements below.  Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR, subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All proposers and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the proposer supports and identify the prime contract number(s) the proposer supports, and identify the prime contract number(s).  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the proposer has taken, or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict.  If the proposer believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in this section.

It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  The Government intends to use non-Government personnel as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering the proposal evaluation and providing selected technical assistance related to proposal evaluation.  These support personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose and are required to sign Organizational Conflict of Interest Non-Disclosure Agreements.  By submission of its proposal, each proposer agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.  Any information not intended for limited release to support contractors must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material.

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government?s needs may submit a proposal that will be considered by DARPA.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government.  Small Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and/or team with others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA is set aside exclusively for Small Businesses, HBCU, or MI participation, due to the impracticability of reserving discrete or severable areas of technology for exclusive competition among these entities.

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a cooperative agreement, procurement contract, technology investment agreement other transaction for prototype agreement, or other such appropriate award.  The Government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award determined appropriate under the circumstances.

8.	Proposal Review Information
A.	Evaluation Criteria:  Specified within the PIP.  The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time.

B.	Security: Specified within the Security Classification Guide.


9.	Award Administration Information
A.	Award Notices:  Offerors will be notified by mail, whether their proposal is recommended for award.  The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract or assistance instrument is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.

B.	Anticipated Number of Awards:  DARPA anticipates awarding multiple contracts/instruments for Phase IA of Program described in this announcement.

DARPA reserves the right to award one or no contract/instruments, if circumstances warrant.

This Modification to the Solicitation updates the Original Response Date from 15 to 20 December 2006.

<DESC>This is a SMALL-BUSINESS SET_ASIDE acquisition for support of the Worldwide  Warehouse Redistribution Services (WWRS) Program.   WWRS is a web-based redistribution service designed to  facilitate re- utilization of excess serviceable spare parts and support  equipment, previously purchased under the Arms Export Control Act, as a  source for filling Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requisitions. WWRS is designed to:  1) reduce FMS customers? excess inventories,  2) provide access to materiel at reduced cost, 3) reduce lead time through  redistribution of assets instead of new procurement, and 4) enable sellers  to purchase needed FMS assets with the proceeds. Program Overview:  WWRS advertises FMS excess and aligns incoming FMS  requisitions with excess materiel to provide FMS requisition support. All  materiel passes through an in-transit inspection point (IIP) contractor.  At the IIP, WWRS excess materiel is inspected (to include verification  that materiel is same NSN as represented), sanitized, and repacked prior  to transfer to the purchaser.  The IIP will take title to the materiel  prior to transfer on behalf of the USG, thereby maintaining anonymity of  the FMS parties. Materiel which fails visual inspection will be returned  to the selling country at the seller's expense. The IIP will process,  store, and make electronically available, digital photos of all materiel.  The materiel will be photographed individually and in aggregate, on a  digital scale.   All materiel shipments that pass inspection are subject  to normal FMS Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) criteria.  The photographs  will be used in adjudicating SDRs.  The IIP may, on an exception basis, be  responsible for performing on-site inspections at seller locations  worldwide, including high threat areas/regions. The IIP may also be responsible for processing US customs clearance for  incoming shipments and receiving shipments with shipping costs due.  The  IIP may also need to establish and maintain satellite offices overseas  with the capability to receive and transship materiel from within one  overseas location to a buyer in another country. The IIP may be responsible for developing or interfacing software in  conjunction with the WWRS Program office. The IIP will be responsible for invoicing the WWRS office on a monthly  basis. Materiel remains in the possession of the seller until the WWRS Program  Manager (PM) requests the materiel.  The WWRS is a virtual materiel  warehouse with WWRS materiel being listed on a WWRS web page by NSN, MMAC,  noun, annual demand, quantity and price.  Interested FMS purchasers may  browse the WWRS web page to determine availability. Materiel may be  ordered by submitting a requisition with the Routing Identifier Code (RIC)  of 'FWW' (indicating WWRS as the desired source of supply) to the Security  Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS) against the appropriate  blanket order FMS requisition case for to the materiel being ordered.  WWRS requisitions are treated as fill or kill requisitions.  The seller  with the lowest priced NSN listed will be selected to fill the  requisition.  When there is insufficient quantity of the lowest priced NSN  to fill the requisition, the next higher priced materiel will be selected.  This selection process will be repeated until the requisition is filled or  all WWRS inventory is depleted.  The remaining unfilled portion of the  requisition will be canceled. Please address each the questions/statements listed below 1. The contractor is only paid for his services after the material is  shipped.  Total processing time may be up to 60 days. The contractor will  be expected to pay shipping to the first destination, and may need to pay  for incoming shipments and then will be reimbursed as part of the  invoicing process.  The largest 60 day accumulated prepaid freight and  services fee to date has been $126,100. Due to system constraints regarding payment the contractor may not be paid  for

The solicitation cited above can only be obtained by accessing a secure website known as the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOpps and the Central Contract Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.   Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following URL http://www.FedTeDS.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled ?Register with FedTeDS? and then choosing the ?Vendor Registration Form? hyperlink.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  (Your Company?s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company?s, CCR Point of Contact) your Company?s DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), your telephone number, and your e-mail address.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation. Mail, facsimile, telephonic or electronic mail requests will not be honored.

<DESC>Modification to Pre-solicitation Notice Announcement A8078070172 - Posted on 11/6/06 Solicitation N8078070172 Modification No. 2 1.  DESCRIPTION, The opening paragraph of the notice is hereby revised to read as follows: The National Park Service (NPS), Pacific West Regional Office (PWR), 1111 Jackson Street, Suite 700, Oakland, California, 94607, is seeking a qualified firm(s) or organization(s) to provide Multi-Disciplinary (civil, environmental, electrical, mechanical, structural, architectural, etc.) Engineering Design Services under an Indefinite Quantity contract for a variety of projects within National Park Service units at locations primarily throughout the States of California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Hawaii, the Commonwealths of Guam and Saipan, and the U.S. Territory of American Samoa. The lead firm(s) selected for contract award will be engineering design firm(s) as the majority of services to be performed under this contract(s) will generally be civil/environmental engineering in nature. The contract type will be firm fixed-priced. The Government may, if appropriate, elect to award a single task order contract or to award multiple task order contracts to one or more sources under this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award contracts, based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference, to the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work. Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued. FAR Part 16 requires that each multiple awardee be given a fair opportunity of consideration for each proposed task order award. In order to provide a fair opportunity and equitable distribution of task orders amongst the awardees, the Contracting Officer will rotate the selection of equally capable awardee based on the location of project, technical capability, capacity, experience, past performance, quality of deliverables, timeliness, and other factors that the Contracting Officer, in the exercise of sound business judgment, believes are relevant to the placement of orders. With respect to the production of plans and specifications (Title II design services), the maximum amount that can be paid to an Architect-Engineer (A/E) is 6% of the estimated cost of construction (41 U.S.C. § 254(b)). In accordance with Department of Interior Acquisition Policy Release (DIAPR) 2004-1, Amendment 1 and its Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (SBCDP) Adjustment of Set-Aside Policy, the NPS has reinstated the use of small business set-asides for A-E Services NAICS Code 541330 - Engineering Services. Accordingly, this acquisition is set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS Code is 541330. The Small Business Size Standard is $4.5 million. For the purposes of this acquisition, any concern will be classified as small business if its average annual gross revenue for the preceding three fiscal years does not exceed the small business size standard stated herein. 2.  Response date of 12/7/06 remains unchanged.                                                                                                       - End of Modification -

The Government intends to award multiple BPAs for this requirement.  Price reasonableness will be determined by competing BPA calls among BPA holders.  If, for a particular purchase greater than the micro-purchase threshold, there is an insuffic ient number of BPAs to ensure maximum practicable competition, the contracting officer shall solicit quotations from other sources and make the purchase as appropriate.  Orders may be placed for Vicksburg District, St. Paul District, Rock Island District,  St. Louis District, Memphis District, or New Orleans District.

For this item, the offeror must identify the production source or his intent to produce the item himself.  Award consideration will be given to an offeror who produces the item or acquires it from a second source in the United States.  This criterion is based on FAR excerpts as follows:  Per FAR 6.202 (a)(1), establishing or maintaining alternative sources, a particular source may be excluded from this contract action in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources for the supplies because it would be in the interest of  national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the supplies in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization.  As per FAR 6.302-3(b)(v)(A), it is necessary to create the required d omestic capability for production of supplies by limiting competition to items manufactured in the United States or divide current production requirements among two or more contractors to provide for an adequate mobilization base.

In most instances, the Contract Laboratory shall be resp  onsible for providing coolers, sample bottles, preservation solutions, trip blanks (if applicable), and supplies.  All costs associated with these tasks shall be borne by the Contractor and not billed separately. 1.2	Contract Background.  The Norfolk District GeoE Section routinely collects or receives primary samples and quality assurance samples that have been collected from various hazardous and toxic waste (HTW) sites, military installations, process streams or  waste streams, or typical environmental sources, such as rivers, lakes, and streams.  The sampling and analytical work will primarily be in conjunction with inv estigations for the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERC LA); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA); the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); and oth ers, including underground storage tank (UST) investigations, the Department of Defense Environm ental Restoration Program - Formerly Used Defense Sites (DERP-FUDS), and the Installation Restoration Program (IRP).    1.3	Contract Objectives.  The objective of this contract is to obtain an analytical laboratory which can provide technically valid and legally defensible environmental data that will meet or exceed the required site-specific Data Quality Objectives (DQOs).   This contract describes the management policies, objectives, principles and procedures which wil l be used to generate data of the required quality.  This contract also defines the quality assurance program for oversight of the Contract Laboratory activi ties and for the evaluation of the analytical data generated by the Contract Laboratory.  All work performed under this contract shall meet the applicable portions of the USACE Engineering Regulation 1110-1-263, Chemical Data Quality Management for Hazardo us Waste Remedial Activities, and any revisions to that document.

In addition to sample type, quantity and analyses required, the delivery order shall specify whether coolers and sample container s are needed for sample collection.  Quantity of samples sent on a delivery order will vary based on project requirements and could even be a single sample.  Work accepted by the Contract Laboratory is expected to meet all of the conditions and requirement  s of this contract. 1.6	Notification of Equipment Failure.  If the Contract Laboratory experiences a breakdown of equipment such that samples for a particular test cannot be analyzed, the Contract Laboratory must notify the Norfolk District GeoE Section within one (1) day.  T his notification will allow the Norfolk District to stop sending samples requiring that particular test.  Once the Contract Laboratory can begin performing that analysis again, it must notify the Norfolk District GeoE Section in order to begin receiving sa  mples with that particular analysis again.  If the Contract Laboratory has samples in-house with analysis which require the disabled equipment and either the holding time or turnaroud time will expire before the Contract Laboratory can replace or fix the e quipment, then the Contract Laboratory must send the samples back to the Norfolk District GeoE Section.  The GeoE Section will then send them to another MRD Chemistry Branch validated laboratory.

<DESC>SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING DRAWINGS, WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THE FEDTEDS WEBSITE (www.fedteds.gov). This work will be for the removal and disposal of the behavioral guidance structure (BGS) and repair of the trash shear boom. The BGS located in the forebay of the dam is a large floating steel curtain about 1100 feet long that extends from 50 to 80 feet below the water surface and is anchored both to the shore and riverbed and to the upstream concrete face of the dam.  The work will require the removal of the BGS including an anchor frame and plates, the BGS structure proper, anchor cables, guide cables, and positioning cables, winches, generator, buoys, clump weights, pontoons and shackle chains.  Portions of the structure embed ded in bottom sediments may remain in place.   The work will require disassembly, metal cutting and fragmentation to manageable sizes, lifting, moving, and removal for disposal or storage as indicated.  Approximately 3,700,000 pounds of structural steel an d equipment was used for original construction of the BGS.  Fragments or portions of the BGS designated for disposal can be taken to the north shore storage area and reduced to smaller sizes to facilitate transport off the project site.   The trash shear boom is approximately 2500 feet long located in the forebay of the dam.  Repairs will consist of replacing approximately 1500 feet of 2 inch wire rope; furnishing and installing a variety of connecting hardware consisting of chains, shackle s, sockets, and a variety of fabricated connecting hardware; and pressure treated 2x12 lumber bumpers.  Fabricate and install a gap seal float.  Float is 15 feet long consisting of two 20 inch diameter HDPE plastic pipes separated by a fabricated stainless  steel frame and screen.  Frame has a weighted keel.  Cylinders are filled with polystyrene to maintain buoyancy..        A considerable amount of underwater diving work will be required at depths up to 110 feet.  Diving will be surface supplied air and recompression chambers are required.  The majority of the work will be performed from the water so barges, barge mounted cra nes, and other floating plants will be necessary.  No hazardous materials are involved.   ADMIN INFO:  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238910.  Solicitation is 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE.  For the purposes of procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its annual average gross income does not ex ceed $13 million.

<SUBJECT>70--Seismic Reflection Data Consisting of Data, Field notes and Geometry Files for CGG Wasatch Plateau to Determine Earthquake Hazards for Dam Safety Investigations of Joes Valley Dam.
<SOLNBR>07SQ810049
<RESPDATE>112806
<ARCHDATE>11212007
<CONTACT>LISA HAYES PURCHASING AGENT 3034452606     lhayes@do.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with MB Seismic, LP, 11011 Richmond Avenue, Suite 225, Houston, TX  77042 to provide Seismic Reflection Data Consisting of Data, Field notes and Geometry Files for CGG Wasatch Plateau to Determine Earthquake Hazards for Dam Safety Investigations of Joes Valley Dam. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other supplies/services will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition: 1.  Description of the supplies or services: The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement to acquire seismic reflection data to determine earthquake hazards for dam safety investigations of Joes Valley Dam. 2. Identify the proposed contractor (with address) and describe why they are the only source capable of providing the supply/service:  MB Seismic, LP, 11011 Richmond Avenue, Suite 225, Houston, TX  77042.  MB Seismic, LP is the sole provider of proprietary CGG seismic reflection lines 202 and 207 from the Joes Valley region. Only this data had sufficient signal to noise and geographic coverage of the Joes Valley fault system, for required investigations of the seismogenic potential of faults near Joes Valley Dam. 3.  Additional facts that support the sole source vendor: We've conducted an investigation of all seismic reflection data available for purchase in the area of interest using data brokers to preview the data and these are the only seismic reflection data that had sufficient signal to noise and geographic coverage of the Joes Valley fault system, for required investigations of the seismogenic potential of faults near Joes Valley Dam. 4.  Describe all market research that led to the decision that there is only one source:  First we contacted the State of Utah to obtain whatever public domain data were available. After reviewing the data from the State of Utah we determined we needed additional data with better geographic coverage in the areas of interest and better signal to noise to allow delineation of fault geometries beneath Joes Valley. We've conducted an investigation of all seismic reflection data available for purchase in the area of interest using data brokers to preview the data and these are the only seismic reflection data that had sufficient signal to noise and geographic coverage of the Joes Valley fault system, for required investigations of the seismogenic potential of faults near Joes Valley Dam. The total cost per mile to purchase the CGG data through MB Seismic, LP is approximately 1/10th the cost per mile to acquire new data. Acquisition of new data would also incur a mobilization charge for equipment and crew of at least $10,000 and probably more than $20,000 for the relatively remote field location. Consequently, it's most cost-effective to acquire the existing proprietary CGG seismic reflection data from MB Seismic, LP. Firms that believe they can provide the required supply described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at lhayes@do.usbr.gov.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS). Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 511210 which is $23.0 Million per year averaged over last 3 years.

<DESC>Management and Review of Plan Benefit Packages Submitted by 
Medicare Advantage Organizations
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)


THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses on the GSA MOBIS Schedule (e.g., small business, 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) that can provide assistance in the management and review of  Plan Benefit Packages (PBPs) submitted by Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations.  

History:  
The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) expanded the role of private entities in providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. Initially, the law added a new section to the Social Security Act; 1860D (Part D) that offered prescription benefits beginning in 2006 through Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). Secondly, the statute allowed for payments to MA ?local plans? (formerly Medicare Plus Choice (M+C) plans) and created a new type of private plan, ?regional? MA plans. Finally, the legislation specified that beginning with the 2006 contract year organizations bidding for contracts or with contracts that offered PDPs and MAs must annually submit bids that support the actuarial basis of its pricing. 

The bidding process was first implemented in 2005 for enrollment and payments to MA organizations beginning January 1, 2006. It required MA organizations to submit bid amounts to CMS by June 6, 2005 containing their estimate of monthly costs for providing services and benefits for the average beneficiary in each plan. The purpose of the bidding by MA organizations was to base the monthly payment on an organization?s monthly expected revenue needs rather than an administratively set amount. CMS reviewed the actuarial value of the bid and negotiated a bid amount with the MA organization. 

Each bid contained a rate which was compared to a benchmark rate announced by CMS (performed annually). The comparison was used to establish additional premiums or rebates due to enrollees of the MA organization. A premium was not charged to the enrollee if the benchmark rate was higher than the bid and rebates provided. The submitted bids were subject to review by CMS. All data was submitted as part of the bid process and subject to audit by CMS or by any person or organization that CMS designated.

Medicare Advantage Bidding

MA organizations must submit an aggregate monthly bid amount for each coordinated care, private-fee-for-service, or Medical Savings Account plan the organization intends to offer. Each aggregate bid for a MA plan represents the MA organization?s estimate of its average monthly required revenue to provide coverage in the service area of the plan for an MA eligible beneficiary with a nationally average risk profile.

Each bid is for a uniform benefit package for the service area. The bid shall contain all estimated required revenue, including administrative costs and return on investment (profit, retained earnings). When preparing the bid form, the MA organization must:

?	Report the Medicare base period allowed costs,
?	Enter the estimated adjustments needed to project the
        base period costs to the contract year,
?	Report the estimated cost sharing values for the contract
        year, and
?	Compute the benchmark, rebate, and member premium.

MA organizations that do not have base period costs (or do not have fully credible experience) must enter an estimated rate that estimates the Medicare costs for the contract year. Also, MA organizations must make an actuarial projection for their populations concerning the expected utilization of each supplemental (both mandatory and supplemental) benefit. CMS reviews the reasonableness of the projections as part of the bid review process.

Review and Approval of Bids

CMS has the responsibility to: (i) review each MA organization?s bid to ensure they are actuarially sound, and (ii) negotiate with MA organizations to request additional information or adjustments of bid amounts. CMS has the authority to negotiate with MA organizations in a style similar to the type of negotiations conducted by the Office of Personnel Management with the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. Organizations may also charge separate premiums for supplemental benefits and for prescription drug coverage.

Health Plan Management System

The Health Plan Management System (HPMS) is a CMS information system and data exchange mechanism for the data related to Medicare managed care organizations. By serving as the centralized repository for Medicare managed care data, the HPMS provides its users with access to this information as well as with an analytical framework for exploring the data. In addition to its analytical functions, the HPMS will support the bid process by providing for: (1) a bid pricing tool, (2) a bid pre-uploaded validation tool, (3) a bid submission module, and (4) a bid desk review module. 

The bid pricing tool forms the bid in combination with the Plan Benefit Package (PBP). The pre-uploaded validation tool compares the PBP to the bid to identify errors prior to upload.  The bid submission module downloads PBP and bid pricing tool software, creates plan structures, uploads plans and resubmissions, and plans for the use of a digital signature. Finally, the bid desk review module will integrate the bid desk review into HPMS and support the concurrent reviews of the Office of the Actuary and the Center for Beneficiary Choices/Medicare Advantage Group.

Purpose

CMS is seeking the services of a contractor to assist in the management and review of benefits contained within a MA organization?s PBP. Each of the plan?s bids must undergo an electronic desk review analysis involving a crosscheck of each benefit category against items shown on the bid pricing tool. For example, do optional supplemental benefit packages in the bid pricing tool agree with the benefits shown in the PBP?  Do premiums for mandatory supplemental benefits agree with premiums shown within the bid pricing tool?  These and other questions must be answered. To accomplish this task, the contractor shall review the current electronic desk review and adjust it to reflect the new requirements of the bid pricing tool.

Additionally, the contractor shall ensure that benefit packages and individual benefits do not discriminate against classes of beneficiaries who require high-priced medical services. Renal dialysis is one example. CMS is required to ensure that a steerage/discrimination bias does not occur in benefit packages offered to beneficiaries who need costly services, or other items such as diabetic supplies as well as clinical and diagnostic services. 

A review of pricing data for benefit services offered to Medicare beneficiaries needs to be completed by CMS before the bid submitted by the MA organization can be approved. The contractor shall assist CMS in analyzing benefit outlier criteria to ascertain if a particular benefit is discriminatory as offered. As part of this review, the contractor shall be required to provide analysis of benefits, services, and their associated costs to population segments to identify any plans that may exceed reasonable plan design criteria.  The plan design criteria shall be provided by CMS to the contractor who will incorporate the standards into an evaluation tool. This tool shall enable CMS staff to test the various bid submissions and shall be revised periodically during the bid season.

Task Descriptions:  
The tasks under this contract shall focus on the management, analysis, and processing of Plan Benefit Packages (PBP) submitted by MA organizations.  The review period begins the first Monday in June and continues for a six month period.  The remaining six months under the contract shall be devoted to preparing for the subsequent bid season. A contractor shall be able to demonstrate they have extensive knowledge with managed care regulations and specific experience with reviewing and processing benefit information provided by MA organizations. The tasks shall include the following:

1. Proficiency with the electronic desk review system that serves as the basis for reviewing all PBPs. The contractor shall be responsible for making changes to the electronic desk review system using lessons learned from the previous bid season. Additionally, the contractor shall provide training to CMS staff on changes made to the electronic desk review system that will impact the following bid season. 

2. Perform first-line reviews of over 10,000 PBPs representing initial and renewal submissions and plan corrections. Second-line reviews must be performed to ensure quality and consistency among the reviewers.
 
3. Identify and research MA operation and policy issues related to the review of PBPs.

4. Analyze data from the MA PBP submissions with the objective of identifying instances of steerage and discrimination against specific classes of beneficiaries. The results of any analyses shall be presented to CMS. 

5. Make several presentations to CMS staff on the concluded 2008 bid season highlighting changes in various markets from prior year submissions. 

Contractor Requirements:  

PLEASE NOTE:  Any potential offeror must demonstrate the following:

1.  Working knowledge and an understanding of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement Act of 2003.

2.  Current knowledge and experience working with the Health Plan Management System (HPMS) and those modules (such as the electronic desk review system) related to managed care and the bid season. If prior experience of the HPMS is not possessed, then the contractor shall possess experience using large data bases to examine and manipulate data and issue reports to management. 

3.  Experience with using a sophisticated Excel spreadsheet enabling CMS to identify MA organizations submitting potentially discriminatory benefit packages affecting high-risk Medicare enrollees. This CMS Excel spreadsheet (known as Ask Marty) is used to evaluate the scope and range of potentially discriminatory benefit structures. If prior experience with this spreadsheet is not possessed, then the contractor shall possess experience using a similar type of Excel spreadsheet to manipulate and analyze data. 

4.  Develop data analysis tools (such as the electronic desk review used to process PBPs) that answer many difficult questions regarding Medicare beneficiary access to a wide range of Medicare managed care and prescription drug offerings. If the contractor does not have experience with a PBP-related data analysis tool such as the electronic desk review system, then contractor shall possess experience with similar types of analytical software tools to review and process large volumes of work.

5.  Ability to respond quickly to information requests from CMS for 2007 and 2008 managed care data. This task requires taking raw bid data (contained in the Ask Marty spreadsheet) and transforming it into readable information. The response time for the presentation of the data can run from four hours to 24 hours after receiving a data request from CMS.

6.  Experience in communicating with many companies (such as Medicare Advantage organizations) and assisting them with meeting mandated deadlines (e.g. the approval of health benefit packages). 

7.  Experience in preparing and giving presentations before small and large audiences on topics related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.

8.  Ability to assign, a team comprised of managed care specialists, statisticians, and computer programmers available during critical times of the contract period. This requirement is due to the seasonal need for the contractor to review and process the submission of PBPs which begins in June and continues for a period of four months (could vary). During the entire contract period, the contractor?s staff must be available to respond to requests for managed care information, participate in meetings with CMS staff, assist in presentations involving the PBP, and other projects involving managed care activities. 

9. Development of a plan to respond to conflict of interest issues when dealing with the managed care community.

It is essential that the offeror be free of all perceived, potential or actual conflicts.  Specifically, the offeror must not have any relationships or arrangements through its business operations or its employees that could be considered as possibly lessening the company?s objectivity concerning any aspect of this action. If such relationships or arrangements exist, offerors shall be required, during the procurement process, to identify potential conflicts of interest and discuss how the conflicts will be addressed and mitigated.

<DESC>Worldwide Warehouse Redistribution Services (WWRS) Program Introduction:  WWRS is a web-based redistribution service designed to  facilitate re- utilization of excess serviceable spare parts and support  equipment, previously purchased under the Arms Export Control Act, as a  source for filling Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requisitions. Goals:  WWRS is designed to:  1) reduce FMS customers’ excess inventories,  2) provide access to materiel at reduced cost, 3) reduce lead time through  redistribution of assets instead of new procurement, and 4) enable sellers  to purchase needed FMS assets with the proceeds. Program Overview:  WWRS advertises FMS excess and aligns incoming FMS  requisitions with excess materiel to provide FMS requisition support. All  materiel passes through an in-transit inspection point (IIP) contractor.  At the IIP, WWRS excess materiel is inspected (to include verification  that materiel is same NSN as represented), sanitized, and repacked prior  to transfer to the purchaser.  The IIP will take title to the materiel  prior to transfer on behalf of the USG, thereby maintaining anonymity of  the FMS parties. Materiel which fails visual inspection will be returned  to the selling country at the seller’s expense. The IIP will process,  store, and make electronically available, digital photos of all materiel.  The materiel will be photographed individually and in aggregate, on a  digital scale.   All materiel shipments that pass inspection are subject  to normal FMS Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) criteria.  The photographs  will be used in adjudicating SDRs.  The IIP may, on an exception basis, be  responsible for performing on-site inspections at seller locations  worldwide, including high threat areas/regions. The IIP may also be responsible for processing US customs clearance for  incoming shipments and receiving shipments with shipping costs due.  The  IIP may also need to establish and maintain satellite offices overseas  with the capability to receive and transship materiel from within one  overseas location to a buyer in another country. The IIP may be responsible for developing or interfacing software in  conjunction with the WWRS Program office. The IIP will be responsible for invoicing the WWRS office on a monthly  basis. Materiel remains in the possession of the seller until the WWRS Program  Manager (PM) requests the materiel.  The WWRS is a virtual materiel  warehouse with WWRS materiel being listed on a WWRS web page by NSN, MMAC,  noun, annual demand, quantity and price.  Interested FMS purchasers may  browse the WWRS web page to determine availability. Materiel may be  ordered by submitting a requisition with the Routing Identifier Code (RIC)  of ‘FWW’ (indicating WWRS as the desired source of supply) to the Security  Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS) against the appropriate  blanket order FMS requisition case for to the materiel being ordered.  WWRS requisitions are treated as fill or kill requisitions.  The seller  with the lowest priced NSN listed will be selected to fill the  requisition.  When there is insufficient quantity of the lowest priced NSN  to fill the requisition, the next higher priced materiel will be selected.  This selection process will be repeated until the requisition is filled or  all WWRS inventory is depleted.  The remaining unfilled portion of the  requisition will be canceled. Please address each the questions/statements listed below 1. The contractor is only paid for his services after the material is  shipped.  Total processing time may be up to 60 days. The contractor will  be expected to pay shipping to the first destination, and may need to pay  for incoming shipments and then will be reimbursed as part of the  invoicing process.  The largest 60 day accumulated prepaid freight and  services fee to date has been $126,100. Due to system constraints regarding payment the contractor may not be paid  for up to sixty (60) days (ex. Contractor ships item first of month,  Security Assistance Maintenance Information System (SAMIS) runs the batch  of items shipped every 30 days (end of month), then the contractors  invoice submitted at end of month is compared to the SAMIS run and if  there are errors it could take up to seven (7) days to resolve before the  program office signs the invoice and forwards to the Defense Finance and  Accounting Services (DFAS) for payment within 21 days. Discuss how you  will manage your business while waiting sometimes up to 60 days for  payment. 2. Please provide your current facility information and capability to  process several hundred shipments per month. 3. Program activity is likely to occur with large fluctuation in shipment  frequency and number.  Describe your ability to maintain a stable  workforce and turn shipments quickly despite lulls and high activity  periods. 4. Please describe the following forms: DD Forms 1348-1, 1387 and 250 and  provide samples of any of these forms previously filled out by your  company. 5. Has your company had any experience with Military Packaging (A/B) and  experience with the MAPAD? Please provide contract numbers where you were  required to perform Military Packaging. 6. Do you have a Government Quality Assurance Representative (QAR)? Please  provide the name and phone number of this individual. 7. Has your company ever used the software “Haystack or CD Fiche” or any  equivalents (please identify if you have used equivalents)? 8. Does your company currently have a Secret Clearance or ever held a  Secret Clearance? 9. Do you currently have insurance to cover any damages to goods while in  your facility? 10.  Do you have the capability of handling and disposing of hazardous  material if necessary? Please discuss. 11. It is anticipated that under the task order Contract Line Item Number  (CLIN) of the contract that the Government may need to purchase  Information Technology (IT) support for this program, for example,  programming, database design, electronic document management systems  support and software customization in accordance with USAF/AFMC/AFSAC  policies, standards and architectures. Does your company have a person  qualified to provide a broad range of information technology support? 12. Does your company have the ability to link to the SAMIS and AFSAC  On-Line systems or upload and download data files to the Web? 13. Does your company have technical experience providing inventory  management control which includes capability to process US customs  paperwork, accept and store materiel received from sellers, capability to  inspect, repackage, remove markings, electronically formatted report  process and the ability to ship in an expedited manner? SOURCES SOUGHT:  All interested and qualified sources are requested to  provide a statement of current capability and past performance information  no later than 9 December 2005.

The Product Manager, Combat Engineer/Materiel Handling Equipment intends to procure many vehicle systems in the upcoming years, all of which will contain diesel cycle engines.  The U.S. Army is currently using, and will continue to use, JP-8 fuel for the f oreseeable future, and the fuel will contain up to 3000 ppm sulfur.  The new EPA regulations being implemented now and in the near future require emissions equipment that may or may not be compatible with this high-sulfur fuel.  The purpose of this questio nnaire is to aid in determining how non-road commercial diesel engine technology (designed to satisfy the EPAs Tier III and IV emission requirements) is affected by high sulfur fuel.

<RESPDATE>013007
<CONTACT>Technical POC, Robert Neumann, 301-227-5163
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is seeking information from potential sources that can provide technologies, systems, or devices for de-emulsification (emulsion breaking) of oil-in-water emulsions that are present in marine vessel bilgewater.  The marine vessel bilgewater discharge contains a mixture of wastewater and leakage from a variety of sources that drain to the lowest inner part of the hull, known as the bilge.  Bilgewater can originate from seawater accumulation, normal water leakage from machinery, and fresh water washdowns, and may contain cleaning agents, solvents, fuel lubricating oils, aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), and hydraulic oils along with other trace materials.   Oil-in-water emulsions formed in bilgewater contain very small and stable droplets, often neutrally buoyant, which pass through oil/water separators.

The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns [8(a), HUBZone, or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned] that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein and in the draft Statement of Work (SOW).  The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NCI?s evaluation of the information received.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this SS or the NCI?s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.   This synopsis is to identify potential sources capable of providing the meeting support services identified in the draft sample statement of work referenced in this synopsis.  As NCI identifies specific meeting requirements, a more detailed Statement of Work will be drafted to cover those specific services and a Request for Proposal will be issued, if appropriate and approved.

This effort will represent NCI's main source of support for meeting planning, preparation of reports, correlated communications, data management, evaluation, and various administrative functions.  The goal of these efforts is to help monitor research programs, transfer research results to health care providers and other researchers, assess the state-of-the-science on topics of special interest, convey clinical recommendations, create opportunities for collaborations, and inform the public of cancer-related health concerns.  The scope of NCI's activities are both national and international.

Construction of a new Grape Genetics Research Center (GGRC) in the Cornell Agricultural and Food Technology Park, Geneva, New York.

The mission of this new research facility is to improve viticulture.  The research evaluates the fundamental genetics of grapes working towards development of a variety of grapes that are more resistant to disease and infestation, and more adaptable to varying climatic regions.  Intended studies hope that this will produce high-yield crops of high quality grapes that can be used for table wine or juice.

The new GGRC facility will be a single story building consisting of laboratories, offices and technology transfer areas, with an integrated mechanical equipment penthouse.  It will have approximately 40 parking spaces, a separate service entrance drive, and dock area.  The overall building area of approximately 60,820 gross square feet including greenhouse, will result in a 53,800 square foot building site footprint.  Project includes four (4) greenhouse units connected to the laboratory building.  Floor plan contains adjacencies of labs, support functions and lab office areas based on a modular laboratory concept.

The laboratories will include: molecular biology, grape rootstock, media and buffer prep, tissue culture core labs, as well as support core areas including: nematode rearing room, fungal culture room, fungal dark room, plant growth chamber (light controlled) core growth chamber facility, fruit chemistry pilot plant, fruit chemistry cold room, shared autoclave room, shared dishwashing facility, core minus 80 degree freezer room, shared instrument room, and core cold room.

<DESC>The US Army Natick Soldier Center (NSC) intends to award a Sole Source contract to Artisent, Inc., Boston, MA, to design and integrate soldier-centric systems during the final year of the Future Force Warrior (FFW) Advanced Technology Demonstration ( ATD) Program.  Under the proposed contract, Artisent will work under FFW Technology Program Office (TPO) guidance with selected FFW subcontractors to design, develop, and integrate field-rugged FFW Basic Soldier and Leader prototype systems.

Artisent has intimate knowledge of the FFW components, has worked on novel design concepts for each component, and developed an integration strategy that works f rom both a technical and soldier based reference point.  Once the design solutions developed under this effort mature, it is anticipated that system components will be procured under full and open competition. This notice of intent is not a request for com petitive proposals. However, all comments received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this not ice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>--Establishment of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) with Services Disabled Veterans
<DESC>This announcement is to solicit interest for the establishment of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with Service Disabled Veterans.  This requirement is restricted to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.  NAICS solicited are 4218 10/423810 Construction and Mining (except oil well) Machinery and Equipment Merchant Wholesalers, 421820/423820 Farm and Garden Machinery and Equipment Merchant Wholesalers, and 421830/423830 Industrial Machinery and Equipment Merchant Wholesalers.  The sm all business size standard for all three listed NAICS is 500 employees.  Equipment may be purchased or rented.  The BPA duration will be 1-year and may be extended at 1-year increments not to exceed 5 years.  Establishment of BPAs does not imply any agree ment by the Government to place future contracts or orders with the BPA holders.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of calls or actual amount of work to be ordered.  The establishment of BPAs does not justify purchasing from only one  source.

ATTACH: BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION for MATLAB BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: Requiring Agency: Racyne Digges AFRLISNS 259 1 K ST BLDG 254 Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 Phone: 255-9407 Fax: 656-7074 PR # F4FBAK6291AOOI Contracting Activity: ASCIPKWIS Wright Patterson AFB OH 45433 Attn: I. The Air Force Research Laboratow, Sensors Directorate identified an  information technology requirement for software. Use of Mathworks Matlah is essential to our  requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  Estimate of $100,262.85 was calculated by using the Mathworks website and dealing with  the government representative from the company. 11. This solicitation was researched and is only produced by Mathworks,  INC. The anticipated cost to the government is expected to be fair and reasonable based on  historical purchases and the prices established. The specific software is needed to ensure  compatibility and interoperability with the existing equipment currently at the location and to meet the  needs of our personnel. In addition, the use of this software is necessary to ensure compliance with  the established Secretary of the Air Forces' requirement for standardization. 111. The proposed brand name justification is the only brand name able to  satisfy the government's requirement. Mathworks, INC. Matlab Software Jared Schuler 508-647-7167 3 Apple Hilt Dr Natick, MA 017-60-2098 IV. To preclude the necessity for future brand name justifications we will  research the market to see what is available at that time. // Signed*// Racyne Digges, GS 12 Financial Analyst 23 Oct 2006 For more information on "Brand Name Justification", please refer to:  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5072

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some internal forums.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>70 - General purpose information technology equipment.
The solicitation number is ITBPA2007.  The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-13.

The requirements will be fulfilled using the Simplified Acquisition procedures, Part 13 of the FAR, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG), to the maximum extent possible.  

This is a total small business set-aside.  The associated North American Classification System (NAICS) code is 443120 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) established Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for Information Technology (IT) requirements for computer hardware and software products in July 2004.  The USPTO intends to add to its existing BPA vendors to fulfill its continuing IT requirements for computer hardware and software products and to further competition.   The USPTO expects to make multiple awards resulting from this synopsis/solicitation. The USPTO's IT product requirements for FY 2006 were approximately $95.5 million, approximately $30 million of which was fulfilled by the BPA Holders for IT Products.  There is, however, no guarantee of requirements. Vendors are not required to have a General Services Administration (GSA) contract in order to submit a proposal in response to this RFQ.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the USPTO.  Teaming is allowed and the USPTO encourages teaming with other small businesses. All BPA orders are generally competed among the BPA holders using simplified acquisition procedures. However, the USPTO reserves the right to limit competition for individual requirements to selected BPA holders, i.e., HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran-owned businesses, to accomplish its socio-economic goals.  The BPAs will have a period of performance of 5 years.  In accordance with FAR 13.303-6, the USPTO will review the BPA at least annually.  If necessary, the USPTO will update or modify existing arrangements as a result of i.e, "changes in market conditions, sources of supply, and other pertinent factors that may warrant making new arrangements with different suppliers or modifying existing arrangements."  The USPTO reserves the right to cancel any company's BPA for any reason, including but not limited to: poor performance, failure to respond to requests for quotes, vendor's prices are determined to be no longer competitive, and all of the reasons listed under FAR 13.303-6(b)(2).      

The Government is seeking a one-stop shopping vehicle, which offers a wide array of computer hardware and software products to include computer hardware, software and licenses, and maintenance that is found under Schedule 70 - General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services. Examples of items that the USPTO may be procuring are:  servers, server racks, color scanners, mass storage units, fiber channel ports and fabric management software, dual port fibre channel cards, routers and switches, security software, automated tape libraries, data tape cartridges, security software, and virus control software.  The vendor must be able to demonstrate that they can offer the USPTO a vast array of IT Products.  The USPTO is not looking for vendors who can only offer a few products or product brands.  Vendors who can only offer a few products and/or limited product brands will be found unacceptable, and will not be considered for award.  Currently, the USPTO has an existing contract vehicle under which it procures desktop computer hardware.  Items on the desktop computer hardware contract vehicle are excluded from these BPAs.   Blanket Purchase Agreement Calls (BPCs) will be issued for any orders placed under any awarded BPA.   Offerors must be authorized dealers or resellers of products that they are offering to the Government at the time of the offering.  The USPTO does not purchase grey market IT products.  Vendors that submit proposals in response to this synopsis/solicitation are required to have been in business for three years or longer.  Vendors that submit proposals who do not meet this requirement will be disqualified and eliminated from competition. The vendor must have the financial resources or the ability to establish lines of credit that will allow the company to fulfill USPTO's IT requirements.  
  
Individual awarded BPCs will state the date and place of delivery, and acceptance and FOB point.  Place of delivery may vary but most hardware deliveries will go to the USPTO warehouse located in Alexandria, VA, 22314.

Factors:  (1) Ability to provide a vast array of computer hardware and software products, (2) Past Performance and Experience, (3) Other Factors, and (4) Price.
    
The provision at 52.212.1, Instructions to Offeror-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  In addition, Offerors are required to submit the following:
(1) Brief capabilities statement addressing ability to provide a vast array of IT Products, not to exceed 5 pages, with optional catalogs and brochures (Capabilities statement, catalogs, and brochures shall not exceed 20 pages in length); (2)(a), a completed Past Performance Evaluation Order submitted to Open Ratings, Inc.; and (2)(b), references to substantiate sales from 5 current customers with whom the offeror has had an established relationship for over one year and sales in excess of $50,000 for the year; and (3) brief capabilities addressing Other Factors, not to exceed 3 pages; and (4) prices for products.  Specifications for products that the vendor must price are listed at: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm. 
Documentation provided for past performance references (item #2 above) will not count toward the 20-page limitation.  There is no required format for the capabilities statement. Table of contents and any cover letter will not be included in the 20-page limitation.    The cover letter and any information contained in the cover letter will not be evaluated.  Pricing information submitted in response to item 4 above will not count toward the page limit.

Supplemental Instructions:
A.  Regarding Factor No. 1 above, Provide a Vast Array of IT Products, the Offeror should address its capabilities to provide a vast array of IT Products to the USPTO. 

B.   Regarding Factor No. 2(a) above, the Offeror must complete a past performance evaluation to Open Ratings, Inc. (a Dun & Bradstreet company) prior to submission of their offer.  A minimum of six references must be provided on the request in order to be processed by Open Ratings, Inc. (www.openratings.com).  However, Open Ratings recommends providing up to 20 references to ensure Open Ratings receives at least six completed responses.  It is strongly encouraged that you proactively contact your references to request that they promptly respond to the Open Ratings, Inc. inquiries for past performance.  The requests for past performance by Open Ratings, Inc. will be sent by email and will be filled out on an on-line survey.  Any vendor not receiving a past performance evaluation from Open Ratings, Inc., may risk receiving a neutral rating under the experience and past performance evaluation factor.  Open Ratings, Inc. charges $125.00 for this service, and Offerors are responsible for direct payment to Open Ratings, Inc. Each Offeror must submit, with its proposal, a confirmation that the past performance evaluation order has been submitted to Open Ratings, Inc.  Open Ratings will provide the Offeror who submitted the request for past performance a copy of the evaluation, along with a copy to the USPTO.  Please provide Open Ratings with the following information as a contact:  Sylvia Van Dyke, Contracting Officer, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 600 Dulany St., MDE 7B03, Alexandria, VA 22313, e-mail: Sylvia.VanDyke@uspto.gov, ph: 571-272-6568, and fax 571-273-6568. The USPTO will evaluate the Offeror's past performance in successfully fulfilling requirements that are relevant or similar to the requirements in this RFQ.  To accomplish this, USPTO will review the results of Open Ratings Past Performance Evaluation to determine acceptability under this factor.   Where appropriate, offerors will be given an opportunity to explain both information concerning the relevancy of the information on past performance provided and any negative past performance information to which the Offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  (Note:  The USPTO reserves the right to consider any other related information which may come to the attention of the USPTO regarding the Offeror's past performance.)

C.  Regarding Factor No. 2(b) above, the Offeror is required to submit references from 5 current customers with whom the offeror has had an established relationship for over one year and have had sales for IT products in excess of $50,000 per year.

D. Regarding Factor No. 3 above, the Offeror is required to address, Other Factors, which the Offeror may offer to the USPTO as an added benefit.  Other factors may include, for example, availability of an internet products catalog, obtaining quotes on-line, ordering and on-line order tracking, credit card acceptance, flexible return policies, flexible hours of operation, distribution centers, technology consultants, use of other small businesses as teaming partners, established partner relationships with major OEMs, and staging warehouse or facilities for equipment to be delivered to the USPTO fully assembled.

E.  Regarding Factor No. 4 above, there are numerous specifications that are listed at the USPTO website (address) from which the vendor must select 5 specifications to price.  It is the vendor's option which specifications it chooses to price.  Prices as submitted will be evaluated.  The vendor should state the percentage of discount, if any, as an example of the types of discounts the vendor may offer to the USPTO.  In addition, the dollar amount of discount shall be listed, along with the total price.  If a part number has changed or been replaced for the hardware or software as a result of an upgrade by the manufacturer, the offeror is to price the most recent version or replacement part number.  The offeror shall note the new part or version number on its pricing documentation.  The prices will be used strictly for evaluation purposes only.  

The provision at 52.212.2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, will be used to evaluate offerors for awarding BPAs.   The Government intends to award BPAs resulting from this solicitation to the most responsible offerors whose offers conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous, representing the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  (1) Ability to provide a vast array of computer hardware and software products;  (2) Past Performance and Experience; (3) Other factors; and (4) Price.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis the purchase under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Symmetricom, Inc , 34 Tozer Road, Beverly, MA 01915-5510, of an Auxiliary Output Generator, Model AOG-110. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-13.  

NIST requires an ultra-high stability frequency synthesizer that has the following characteristics: 
Three 5 MHz outputs, +13 dBm into 50 ohms, greater than 80 dB isolation, stability (Allan deviation) better than 2e-13 at 1 second with 1/t dependence out to 10,000 seconds and longer where the stability is better than 4e-17.  This stability is maintained for fractional frequency offsets up to 1e-9. The phase noise of the output shall be less than 3 dB above the input 5 MHz reference. Fractional frequency offsets up to +/- 1e-7 range with 1e-19 resolution. Must have absolute and relative frequency control. Temperature sensitivity relative to reference less than 10 ps per degree C. Input frequency reference is 5 MHz from an active hydrogen maser with power in the range of +6 dBm to +15 dBm. The instrument shall have a 1 PPS output, with the following characteristics; positive going, amplitude greater than 3 volts into 50 ohms (TTL compatible), 20 microsecond pulse width, rise time less than 5 ns, jitter less than 1 ns rms. The instrument shall have a timing input for synchronizing the output 1 PPS, with the following characteristics; amplitude greater than 3 volts into 50 ohms (TTL compatible), pulse width greater than 100 ns, rise time less than 5 ns, synchronization to better than 15 ns. The computer interface shall have the following characteristics; RS-232 compatible control, supports 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600 and 19200 baud rates, all frequency, phase and clock controls available remotely. Power requirements are 110 VAC, 60 Hz, secondary DC input of 18 to 30 VDC. The instrument must be rack mountable. A proven track record of excellent reliability is necessary.

<DESC>Grand Forks AFB intends to solicit and award a sole source purchase order to Octagon Process for  5000 gallons of De-icing fluid stock number 6850-01-435-6471, AMS-1424 Type 1, Octagon Octaflo.  The applicable NAICS is 334220 with a size standard of 750 employees.  


Justification for sole source is as follows:
This purchase is to replenish existing stocks of de-icing fluid maintained at the Grand Forks AFB.  The fluid is contained in a 25K gallon tank.  We are required to maintain a minimum balance of 8,364 gallons on hand for War Reserve Stockage.    The following guidance is available on restockage: 
A.	 IAW Technical Order 42C-1-2 paragraph 3.1.2.1, ?de-icing fluid can be mixed if residual in the storage tank is no more than 10% of the final volume, the identity of the mixed fluid shall be the same as the added product?. 

B.	IAW Technical Order 42C-1-2 paragraph 3.1.3.2, ?anti-icing fluid differs in chemical composition from manufacturer to manufacturer and are not required to be compatible.  Never cross mix type IV fluids from different manufacturers?. 
As a result of this technical guidance and the high War Stockage levels we are required to maintain, the replenishment must be the same brand as the existing stocks.  The existing stocks are of De-icing fluid stock number 6850-01-435-6471, AMS-1424 Type 1, Octagon Octaflo

Any interested party, other than Octagon, that feels they can satisfy this requirement must identify their interest, experience, and capability to satisfy the requirement no later than 3 days after the posted date of this announcement.  All interested parties must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) database.

The SMDC DARPA Office will notify offerors within six (6) months of white paper receipt if a full proposal is requested.  White papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data.   6.	Formal BAA proposals may be submitted without submission and review of a white paper. Offerors are encouraged to use the Summary White Paper process described above and may submit a formal proposal even if the government does not request it.  Issuance o f the BAA or any request for submission of a proposal does not obligate the Gov ernment to pay any proposal preparation costs. PART I -  WHITE PAPER PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION 1.

This announcement will become effective upon publication and will remain open for one year from date of publication.   PART III - EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it related to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exis ts.  Proposals will be evaluated monthly. The following factors are to be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA.   1.	General:  The Government selection of the proposal (s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the Government considering technical and management relative merit in accordance with the evaluation cri teria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance, using the areas and factors set forth below. 2.	Evaluation Areas/Factors 	a.	Technical Area.  The quality of the offeror's technical approach will be evaluated using the following factors: 		(1)	Overall Scientific/Technical Quality  The offeror will be evaluated on the overall scientific/technical merits of the proposed research and development.  The scientific/technical merits may include potential for state-of-the-art improvement, with sp ecial emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness. 		(2)	Qualifications  Capabilities and qualifications of the key research personnel relevant offeror experience and adequacy of facilities and instrumentation as required. 		(3)	Research and Development Contribution  Potential contribution of the proposed research to USASMDC in the above technology areas. 	b.	Management Area.  The quality of the offeror's proposed management approach will be evaluated using the following factors: 		(1) Overall Scheduling and Planning  The offeror's approach will be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort. 		(2) Expenditure Control  The approach for controlling expenditures and labor hours. 	c.	Cost Area 		The cost area is comprised of two evaluation factors; cost realism and total evaluated probable cost.  The cost realism and total evaluated probable cost to the government of the proposed work will be evaluated using the following: 		a.  Cost Realism:  The proposal will be evaluated to assess the likelihood that the technical and management approaches proposed could be accomplished at the cost proposed.  Cost realism will be evaluated but not rated. 		b.  Total Evaluated Probable Cost:  The proposal  will be evaluated to develop the governments estimate of the most probable cost to the government of successfully completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed. 	d.	Relative importance of Evaluation Criteria 		(1)  Technical:  The technical area is significantly more important than the management area.  The factors under the technical area are of equal importance. 		(2)  Management:  The management area is significantly less important than the technical area.  The factors under the management area are of equal importance. 		(3)	Cost:  (a)  The cost area is a substantial evaluation factor, however, it is less important than each of the technical and management areas.  (b)  Cost realism is a very important consideration in the evaluation of the technical and management areas.  Poor cost realism may result in a lower evaluation of the technical and management areas.  3.	Selection of proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the Government considering technical and management relative merit in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value consid erations, availability of funds, and program balance.  In some cases, the merits of a particular proposal in a technical discipline may lead to a decision with respect to funds availability relevant to USASMDC goals. PART V - OTHER INFORMATION 1.	The Government anticipates making multiple awards. Issuance of the BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs.  Offerors will be notified of selection for award approximately 45 days after government receipt of the propos als.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  Proposals not selected for immediate funding may be considered for a period of 6 months. 2.	Cost Plus Fixed Fee completion and/or level of effort contracts are expected to be awarded.  Contracts, grants, and other transaction awards will be considered.  For planning purposes, awards are anticipated from $100,000 to $5M for the basic contract w ith a period of performance not to exceed 12 months.  In addition to the basic contract, up to four (4) options can be proposed.  However, the total contract value for the basic and options cannot exceed $45M and the total period of performance for the bas ic and options cannot exceed 72 months.  This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of final report.   3.	Any necessary coordination of facility use will be performed by the offeror.   4.	The number and types of reports will be specified in the award document. However, the following are the titles, data item description (DID) numbers, and frequency of data items anticipated to be delivered during contract performance: 		(1)  STATUS REPORT,  			DI-MGMT-80368, Submission: Monthly/Quarterly	 		(2)  FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPORT 			DI-FNCL-80331, Submission: monthly 		(3)  SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL REPORTS SUMMARY 			DI-MISC-80048, Special Technical Report,  			Submission: As required by events 		(4)  OPERATIONAL SECURITY (OPSEC) PLAN, One-time  			(if required) 		(5)  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN 			DI-IPSC-81427A (if required) 		(6)  STATUS REPORT, FINAL REPORT 			DI-MGMT-80368, Submission: One Time 5.	Security Requirements:  While non-classified work is relevant, research at SMDC often leads to military applications and development or use of data that can be classified.  This is not always known ahead of time, and when it does the applicant must be p repared to deal with classified information.  Possession of a SECRET facility clearance is recommended.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some internal forums.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This amendment provides the final batch of questions that were received in response to this procurement and their answers.  Also, please be reminded of the response due date for proposals next week, no later than 12pm (noon) on November 30, 2006.  Q&A is below.

Mark 



Q - Since the personnel to be furnished are all working at TSA sites and not contractor sites, will TSA ?hold? or ?own? the clearances of these personnel as it has under other similar contracts?

A - The government agency does not hold the collateral clearance on the contractor.  The government agency only holds the SCI access.  It is the responsibility of the contract company to acquire the collateral clearances.

Q - Since/if that is the case, it would appear unnecessary for the Contractor itself to hold a TS facility clearance.  Is that correct?  Please clarify any facility clearance requirements for the Contractor and applicable TSA Security policies.

A - The contract company bidding for the contact must hold a cage code which identifies the clearance level of the company.  This clearance level must be at the same classification as the level of the clearances granted by the company and meet the requirements for the contract in which they are bidding.  Further clarification can be found in the NISPOM Chapter 2, Security clearances, Section 1, Facility clearances (FCL) and Section 2, Personnel Security clearances.

Q - Section B requests offerors to propose an hourly rate as the basis of the contract, and Section C.11 indicates that while there is a ?normal? work schedule that SSO?s may be recalled.  If such a recall or other government request for additional hours results in hours in excess of 8 hours a day or 40 hours per week, will the contractor be able to bill for the hours in excess of 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week?  Please clarify.

A - The contract will be a labor hour arrangement.  Authorized hours worked in excess of 40 per week will be billable, however, such hours must be authorized prior to start of work.  The total hours listed in Section B includes some recall hours.  

Q - The base period is 12 months and there are 3 one year options, for a total of 48 months, yet the ?total? period cannot exceed ?51? months.  Please clarify.

A - This is a typo and will be corrected in Section F prior to contract award.  

Q - Since this will be a full and open competition, please clarify the reason that the contractor must provide ?evidence of audit approved G&A rates.?

A - TSA often requests this additional information to aid in cost and price analyses should they become necessary.  It is requested for all types of solicitations.  This is not a request for certified cost and pricing data, which is disallowed by AMS for commercial products and services.

<DESC>Questions and answers from the pre-proposal conference: 1)	 Question: Regarding page 6, SubCLIN 0001AD: Contractor-furnished containers: Whose responsibility is it to transport the Government-owned containers from the inbound contractor's facility to the outbound contractor's facility?  If the one responsible f or transporting the containers is in a different area of performance, will that contractor receive additional compensation for traveling outside their area of performance? Answer: The outbound contractor, when directed by the ordering officer, shall pick up and store empty Government-owned containers from carriers from all areas of performance under the solicitation. This will apply to SubCLINs 0001AD, 0002AD, and 0003AD. 2)	Question: Regarding page 7, SubCLIN 0001AF:Unaccompanied Baggage  Residence:  Shouldn't the unit of issue read 'Hundred Weight (Short),' not 'Shipment?' Answer: Yes. The solicitation SubCLIN is being modified accordingly. 3)	Question:  Regarding page 71, Contract Manpower Reporting.  Are we allowed to quote a rate of Manpower Reporting that is greater than the cost of 20 hours of work? Answer: Please quote as you feel is appropriate. 4)	Question:  Regarding page 71, Contract Manpower Reporting.  It reads:  'The required information includes& (2) Contract number, including task and delivery order number.'  Do we have to report each shipment for a member separately, or can he report one figure for the entire contract? Answer:  Please assume that you have to report for all shipments as a whole. For informational purposes, the amounts you propose for the SubCLINs for Contract Manpower Reporting on the bids that you win will be combined into one new CLIN for one Contract M anpower Report, with a price equal to a total of the prices you bid for the Reporting on the CLINs that you win. 5)	Question:  There are occasions when reweighing is required.  Are you going to include a SubCLIN for reweighing? Answer:  At this point in time, no SubCLIN will be included for reweighing. If required, it will be addressed at that time. 6)	Question: Regarding page 30, SubCLIN 0007AB: Storage, including warehouse handling (for intra-city and intra-area moves).  The SubCLIN states that in extraordinary circumstances, storage will be authorized for one period of up to eight (8) days.  What i f the period has to be longer than eight days? Answer:  The up-to-eight-day storage period is for extraordinary circumstances.   The SubCLIN will remain as written. 7)    Question:  Regarding page 32, SubCLIN 0007AE:  Drayage beyond are of performance.  The SubCLIN allows drayage, not to exceed 50 miles, commencing from the outer boundary of the contract area of performance to the destination point.  There are instanc es when the move is longer, for instance when a 'Suffolk' contractor must ship to Staten Island.    The drayage distance should be larger.         Answer:  The maximum distance for drayage is being changed in the solicitation, for SubCLINs 0007AE, 0007AF, and 0007AG, to 110 miles. 8)	Question:  Regarding page 37, SubCLIN 0009AA:  This SubCLIN  for Complete Service  Residence does not have the complete description shown for SubCLINs 0007AA and 0008AA. Answer:  The extended description for SubCLIN 0009AA is being expanded to include what is written for SubCLINs 0007AA and 0008AA. 9)	Question: Regarding the Contractor Manpower Reporting SubCLINs:  Will the Contractor receive the amount bid on one of the SubCLINs or a total of all the SubCLINs for Manpower Reporting for the CLINs that the Contractor wins. Answer: The contract(s) will each contain one new CLIN for Contract Manpower Reporting with a price that is equal to the bids for Contract Manpower Reporting on the CLINs that the particular Contractor won. 10)	Question:  The wage determinations for the counties of Morris, Sussex, Union, Hudxon and Essex counties in the state of New Jersey are missing.

Answer:  The FAR allows FAR clause 52.217-8 to be incorporated by reference. However, we will incorporate  it in full text. 12)	Question:  Item 0001AD (0002AD & 0003AD) contractor furnished containers: Is the price requested for new or used containers.
