<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Woods Hole, MA has a requirement for fishery observer services. The Contractor shall collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data at sea through interviews of vessels captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear and collection of samples. Data collected includes data on the vessel, crew, fishing practices and cost of operation. This data is necessary for the management of fisheries occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas beyond the EEZ. The work requires deploying trained NEFSC certified observers to meet coverage levels prescribed in sea day schedules developed by NMFS/NEFSC.  NEFSC will train the contractor’s observers once the contract is awarded as needed and at the Government’s expense.  The Contractor shall support, as specified, the observers during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy observers to ports from which fishing vessels depart. This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for observers, reimbursing vessel operators for observer meals, and reimbursing observers for travel expenses. Vessels operate out of ports from North Carolina to Maine in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions. Typically, trips are 1- 5 days in duration. Vessels are generally 30-100 feet in length. Crew members and observers live and sleep in close quarters, often in damp conditions and share common facilities. Because of the size of the vessels, motion sickness can be debilitating for some individuals. Observers must be willing to travel occasionally to cover locations other than their home ports.  The Government estimates 12,000 sea days per year.  The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract.  The contract award date is anticipated to be October 1, 2005 with a period of performance of five (5) years thereafter.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires an electron beam lithography system for the NIST Advanced Measurement Laboratory (AML) Nanofab.  The e-beam lithography system is to be used for both direct write lithography and mask writing. 

The Contractor is responsible for supplying the lithography system as well as any vibration, acoustic, and electromagnetic isolation required to meet the technical specifications.  

The NIST AML Nanofab will be operated as a shared access user facility.  This means that the staff of NIST and its partners, subject to provisions, training, and user fees, will be permitted to independently operate much of the equipment.  

The e-beam lithography tool being procured will likely have only two certified operators.  The tools will be operated in a manner such that a wide variety of materials can be processed.  The facility will be directed by NIST’s Semiconductor Electronics Division. Unlike other Nanofabs, the NIST AML Nanofab is unique in that it is located next to the most advanced metrology tools in the world, and its focus will be on fabricating nanoscale structures necessary for metrology and standards in support of the semiconductor industry, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and homeland security.  

This requirement is being procured using Simplified Acquisition 
Procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items via full & open competition.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number 
SB1341-05-Q-0673.

The RFQ is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about June 7, 2005, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant purchase order.   No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

THE DUE DATE FOR QUOTATIONS SHALL BE IDENTIFIED IN THE SOLICITATION.

<DESC>The NIST, Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, has a need for a high performance, high resolution, high vacuum, research grade thermally-assisted, field emission electron probe microanalyzer (FE-EPMA) fitted with at least three wavelength spectrometers (WDS) and one energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS).  

The instrument must provide the highest stability and reproducibility technically possible, as well as the highest quality electron optical performance and detector response over the widest range of operating conditions.  

This instrument will advance the ability to qualitatively and quantitatively determine the element composition of research materials on the micrometer scale, especially to improve the ability to identify and characterize particles and to evaluate the thickness and compositional heterogeneity of thin films and layered specimens used in opto-electronic devices.  

It will contribute to the improvement of ongoing programs of high accuracy quantitative analysis, x-ray mapping, and Standard Reference Material (SRM) certification.  In addition, it will play a significant role in the development of new detectors, such as the microcalorimeter and the Si drift high count rate detector.

This requirement is being procured using simplified acquisition procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items via full & open competition.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-05-Q-0791.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) intends to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) W58RGZ-05-R-0005 to conduct a full and open competitive procurement for the U.S. Army's Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH) requirements. The ARH will utilize Non-Developmental Item (NDI) aircraft and associated support equipment to conduct armed reconnaissance to fight for actionable combat information to enable joint/combined air-ground maneuver execution of mobile strike, close combat, an d vertical maneuver operations across the full spectrum of military operations.  The ARH will provide precision capability through lethal organic fires, dynamic employment of joint networked fires, and responsive target acquisition/identification for full spectrum, day and night operations; be rapidly deployable for global employment against a distributive, highly adaptive threat on an asymmetrical battlefield employing conventional and unconventional methods; enable the air-ground maneuver commander to 'se e-understand-act first' with a warfighter-in-the-loop to provide proactive decision making, assure critical reaction time and maneuver space, and set the conditions for the joint/combined air-ground maneuver team to 'finish decisively'.   A best value approach will be used in the source selection process.  The Government anticipates that the contract award will include an initial Cost Plus Incentive Fee effort for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase with Firm Fixed Price Op tions for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP).

Pre-Proposal Conference
Meeting Minutes
New Courthouse
El Paso, TX
Solicitation No. GS-07P-05-UHC-3003
June 30, 2005

Lisa Byrd, GSA Contracting Officer, opened the conference at 11:00a.m.  She introduced herself, Howard Bergman (GSA PM), Tyler Mason (BPLW PM), Stuart Blakely (Predock PM), Silvia Terrazas and David Saenz (GSA Building Management staff in El Paso office).  Ms. Byrd read through the conference agenda, stressing the fact only a written amendment could alter the specifications; no verbal comments made during the conference have any effect on the scope requirements.  She informed everyone any technical questions should be addressed to Mr. Bergman, Mr. Mason and Mr. Blakely.  Any questions relating to the contract should be addressed to her. 

Ms. Byrd described the best value source selection procurement method that will be used to select a contractor for this project.  She emphasized technical expertise and past performance will be the most important evaluation factors, but price will be also be important, as the project has a very tight budget.  Ms. Byrd went over the SF 1442 form, explaining how the price proposal should be prepared.  She also informed the group this is a "separated contract", which is allowed under the State of Texas tax code.  This means the contractors do not have to pay sales tax on materials.  They must indicate on the SF 1442 the cost of materials, the cost of labor and the total cost of the two.  By "separating" these costs, they will be in compliance with the State of Texas tax code. 

Ms. Byrd stated the proposal due date will be changed from July 15, 2005 to August 1, 2005.  The Government may choose not to answer any questions/RFI's after July 22, 2005, in order to incorporate all answers in an amendment in time for offerors to include this information in their proposal.  All questions/RFI's must be submitted in writing, via e-mail, to the attention of Ms. Byrd.

A Construction Management (CM) firm will be hired to act as the Government's on-site representative during construction.  This firm will be responsible for the day-to-day oversite of the project.  They will conduct inspections and handle all paperwork, in coordination with the GSA CO and PM.  The GSA PM will also be on site on a daily basis for the first several weeks of the project.

Ms. Byrd stressed the importance of checking the FedBizOps website on a daily basis, as this is the only source of information about the project.  All amendments will be posted to this website, which is www.eps.gov   If anyone has any questions about accessing this website, please call Ms. Byrd at 817/978-2714 or send an e-mail to lisa.byrd@gsa.gov 

Mr. Bergman then told the group this is the second time we have solicitated construction services for this project.  The first solicitation was issued on a full and open competititve basis to CMc firms.  Skanska USA Building, Inc. (Skanska) was selected, but was unable to provide a Guaranteed Maximum Proposal (GMP) that met the project budget. Mr. Bergman asked Mr. Mason to give a brief description of the work involved for this project, which Mr. Mason did.

The floor was then opened to questions.

Q - question
A - answer

Q - since there have been some changes incorporated into the construction documents since the first solicitation, should we purchase the revised documents?
A -yes, in order to make sure you don't miss any of the changes.

Q - Skanska had informed all subcontractors they (Skanska) would conduct all required testing.  How will this be handled now?
A - the GC will be responsible for ensuring all required testing, as described in the documents, is performed.  They may require the subs perform the testing - it will be up to the GC's.

Q - will Skanska be allowed to bid again?
A - yes, since the documents have been changed.

Q - would those GC's present introduce themselves?
A - representatives from WG Yates & Sons, Gilbane Building Company, Banes General Contractors/Caddell Construction Co., Inc. (Joint Venture) and Thos. S. Byrne Ltd. introduced themselves to the group.  

Ms. Byrd introduced the representative from the Small Business Administration (SBA) El Paso field office, who was there to meet with the small businesses in attendance, to offer advice and help as requested.  He in turn introduced his assistant, who he said would be available to meet with the small businesses after the meeting.

After stressing once again the importance of checking the FedBizOps website on a daily basis for information pertaining to the project, Ms. Byrd adjourned the meeting at approximately 12:10p.m.

<SUBJECT>59 -- LiveScan Devices - Digital Fingerprints
<DESC>The US Postal Inspection Service intends through a strategic sourcing initiative to solicit and award a contract for the purchase of 24 digital fingerprint/palm print/handprint devices units for use by Inspection personnel in criminal investigations.  The selected supplier shall be responsible for providing a complete digital print scanning, print identification, and store-and-forward system, including integration, testing, deployment and support of the devices at various USPIS locations throughout the United States.  The USPS has determined that limiting competition among those suppliers whose devices have been certified by the FBI at 1000 ppi most effectively leverages supply chain management practices and satisfies the Postal Service's business objectives.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  This synopsis is published for information purposes only.  Telephonic inquiries or responses will not be honored.
