<DESC><p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 11-01-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800 <br /><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>This BAA is a contracting tool directly responsive to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Integrated Cyber Defense attributes.</p>
<p>This BAA seeks to procure proactive cyberspace defensive capabilities for anticipating and avoiding threats through understanding the cyber situation, predicting adversarial actions, assessing potential impacts, and for implementing deterrence and effects-based defensive methodologies. It also supports work to detect and defeat threats and protect information systems by engagement and influence through defensive mechanisms employing such methods as adversary denial and deception. Also included are areas to adaptively maintain, organize, and automatically regenerate and reconstitute resources to ensure continued mission operations.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate is soliciting white papers for Cyber Mission focus areas and Computer Network Defense &amp; Support. The following section provides a description of focus areas within Integrated Cyber Defense and a general description of the Computer Network Defense (CND) &amp; Support Technology base.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC for each focus area is provided for QUESTIONS ONLY. See Section IV Paragraph 6 for submission details.</p>
<p>FY 11 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: CYBER AGILITY</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Currently, adversaries can plan their attacks carefully over time by relying on the static nature of our networks, and launch their attacks at the times and places of their choosing. The DoD needs new tools and technologies to reverse the current asymmetry that favors our cyber adversaries, by forcing them to spend more, cope with greater levels of complexity and uncertainty, and accept greater risks of exposure and detection due to the significantly increased requirements for reconnaissance and intelligence collection of our networks. If we control the dynamics of our systems and networks, any deviation from these known dynamics can also provide an opportunity for increased discrimination of attacker activity and unexpected system states. AFRL will pursue Science &amp; Technology for defensive cyber maneuver and agility to disrupt adversary cyberspace operations, including adversary attack planning and execution.</p>
<p>Agility mechanisms must be incorporated in such a way that they are transparent to authorized users, and must introduce minimal functional and performance impacts. We wish to disrupt our adversaries and not ourselves. The security of such mechanisms is also paramount, so that their power is not co-opted by attackers against us for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Objective: The objective is to avoid attacks by making it harder for a determined adversary to succeed by increasing agility, diversity, and redundancy, to disrupt attack planning and execution.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to:<br />Walt Tirenin (315) 330-1871 Walt.Tirenin@rl.af.mil</p>
<p><br />For FY12, we are specifically seeking white papers in the two areas of "Polymorphic Enclaves" and "Polymorphic Machines" as described below.</p>
<p>FY 12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: POLYMORPHIC ENCLAVES</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The current static nature of our systems and networks allows attackers to continually gather intelligence, and perform planning needed, to execute cyber attacks at will. Intelligence collection can occur from both outside and inside our networks; therefore agility must be incorporated comprehensively across our networks to address these threats. Network intelligence gathered by an attacker remains valid for as long as the network remains static. In order to help defend and shield our networks from attack, we must break the underlying assumption of their static nature.<br /><br />Objective: We seek to create a rapidly-shifting network architecture with automated agility and diversity mechanisms, to continually, dynamically, and unpredictably modify or morph the network into secure operational modes both before and during attacks. If a successful attack should occur, the network must not only survive the attack, but also ensure minimal disruption of the services provided by the network by "mutating" or shifting into a form that can prevent further or future attacks. These capabilities must, however, maintain the transparency and utility of the network and its services to authorized users, while creating uncertainty and complexity for the attacker. Potential agility techniques may include asymmetric routing; MAC, IP, and Port hopping; service migration; OS "fingerprint" spoofing; and possibly protocol mutations. These techniques must be employed in combination with a system-level architecture that ties these mechanisms together, to ensure optimal effectiveness and proper management.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to:<br />Walt Tirenin (315) 330-1871 Walt.Tirenin@rl.af.mil</p>
<p>FY 12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: POLYMORPHIC MACHINES</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Large-scale adoption of homogeneous computing environments, such as the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC), creates significant risk of wide-spread and rapidly-executed disabling attacks. Standardized machine configurations like the FDCC are widely adopted in government and industry. They have been shown to reduce maintenance costs and some vulnerabilities by simplifying and standardizing configuration, and thus reducing the incidence of attacks due to human errors. Unfortunately, a single attack exploit for the standardized configuration can be used to compromise all systems with that configuration. To counter this threat, we can leverage for example, virtualization extensions found in modern commodity processors to provide low overhead diversification of code. We can also apply metamorphic transformations on code, a technique that has been effectively used by malware authors, to create semantically equivalent but behaviorally different variants of programs.</p>
<p>Objective: We seek a variety of different methods and mechanisms, integrated and applied in a manner that is controlled by the transformation and diversification process, and yet appears to an attacker to be a continuously and randomly shifting target space. These capabilities must, however, maintain the transparency and utility of the systems to authorized users, while creating uncertainty and complexity for the attacker.</p>

<p>FY 11 &amp; FY12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: INCORRUPTIBLE DATA CODES / EXECUTABLES</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) requires trustworthy data and software executables for successful performance of assigned missions.</p>
<p>Objective: Deliver self-contained, verifiably incorruptible/trustworthy data and executables with protection while at rest, under execution, or in transit upon and within any environment/system relevant to the warfighter. This includes both our own systems and systems that we do not own or directly control.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Incorruptible Data Codes / Executables" focus area is interested in the research challenges identified below. However, different approaches and concepts deemed to have significant potential to achieve the stated objectives will be considered.<br /><br />&bull; Development and technical evaluation and refinement of watermarking algorithms and protocols for the purpose of information provenance, pedigree, and assurance:<br /><br />&bull; Addressing all forms of data and multimedia formats; to include but not limited to: images, audio, video, formatted and raw data types<br /><br />&bull; Protocols with provable security which incorporate other accepted security mechanisms (timestamping, hashing, key exchange, etc.)<br /><br />&bull; Particular emphasis on:<br /><br />&nbsp; Interaction of watermarked data with watermarked/secured code which has Anti-Tamper and Protection guarantees<br />&bull; Watermarking algorithms and protocols which provide multiple aspects (provenance, pedigree, assurance) while working in conjunction with data for specific application (sensing, etc)<br />&bull; Software-only data and executable protections <br />&bull; Hardware-assisted data and executable protections<br />&bull; Measuring and verifying incorruptibility/trust</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to:<br />Chad Heitzenrater (315) 330-2575 Chad.Heitzenrater@rl.af.mil</p>
<p>FY11 &amp; FY12 FOCUS AREA: ASSURED EXECUTION</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The current focus of computer security is at the operating system (e.g. role-based users), applications (e.g. anti-virus programs), and the network (e.g. firewalls). Focus needs to be shifted to the operating system at the hardware and virtualized hardware layers. Innovative technology developments are sought to defend computers and computer networks, and assure dynamic mission objectives.</p>
<p>Objective: The vision of this program is "A trusted execution environment within each device (e.g. computer, network router) that is a platform for conducting cyber defensive operations that uses "out of band" communication, and remains trusted should the host be compromised." The two areas of high interest are 1) Virtualization and 2) Root of Trust.</p>
<p>Virtualization: The combination of complex applications running on complex operating systems presents a very large footprint to attack. Additionally, DoD has very little control over modern shrink-wrapped software applications and operating systems. Current cost concerns prohibit DoD from developing, building, and maintaining their own applications, operating systems, and hardware. Virtualization technologies offer ways to defeat cyber attacks prior to engagement. Key concepts include but are not limited to: A secure environment that encapsulates and protects the operating systems, device drivers, and applications; secure, segregated, inaccessible areas for critical code; and secure communications for critical code processes.</p>
<p>Root of Trust: The integrity of computers and computer networks is dependent on the integrity of the host hardware and host root account. This area of research investigates modeled hardware root of trust that imparts immunity from an adversary with root access to the underlying host. Innovative ways to achieve a secure root of trust on a host are sought. Also sought are ways to achieve a network root of trust.</p>

<p>FY 11 &amp; FY12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: FIGHT THROUGH &amp; SURVIVE WITH MISSION ASSURANCE</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The DoD has a critical need for information systems that adapt and/or gracefully degrade when unexpected events occur. These systems are subjected to constant change such as overload, component failure, cyber attacks, evolving operational requirements, and/or a dynamic operational environment. A system should adapt to these changes by reconfiguring its resources to provide a different, though acceptable, level of service and security to assure mission essential functions. Without adaptation many important activities receive fewer resources than needed while less important activities waste resources by receiving more resources than necessary. Most existing systems either do not adapt or have ad hoc hardwired mechanisms to accommodate only a small, predefined, set of changes. There are no standard methodologies or common tools to assist application developers in managing this sort of dynamic adaptation.</p>
<p>Objective: The vision for this focus area is "survive with mission assurance". This focus area is concerned with runtime assessment and management of resources/assets to ensure mission essential functions and conveying trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Fight Through &amp; Survive with Mission Assurance" focus area explores the research challenges below, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>(1) Cyber Defense Metrics - Identify low-level observable properties and measurable quantities that contribute to the mission based assessment.</p>
<p>(2) Mission Aware Adaptive Tradeoffs - Integration of QoS (Functionality) and QoIA (Security) management. There is a need to understand tradeoff policy and de-confliction of QoS and QoIA based on the mission. There is a need to develop fine-grained tunable IA mechanisms and controls.</p>
<p>(3) Survivability Architecture- Compose a survivability architecture that supports and enforces service delivery and information assurance requirements based on mission priorities.<br />Funding for this focus area is not available in FY12.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to:<br />Pat Hurley (315) 330-3624 Patrick.Hurley@rl.af.mil</p>
<p>FY 11 &amp; 12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: SELF-REGENERATIVE INCORRUPTIBLE ENTERPRISE THAT DYNAMICALLY RECOVERS WITH IMMUNITY</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Existing approaches to information system security and survivability consist of preventing, detecting and containing unintentional errors and/or cyber attacks. The problem with this approach is that regardless of how well systems are protected or how well they tolerate errors and/or attacks; they will eventually fail over time unless they have the ability to self-regenerate. Once a successful cyber attack is discovered the adversary can quickly use the same attack over and over again to cause the same negative effect on our mission. Existing systems are currently taken offline and out of the fight for hours to days to be repaired and there is no guarantee that the repair is immune to the attack or variants of the attack. What are needed are information systems that are able to dynamically recover with immunity in mission time without human intervention in response to unforeseen errors and/or previously unknown cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Objective: The vision for this focus area is "recover with immunity". This focus area is concerned with recovering with immunity from errors and/or cyber attacks to ensure mission critical systems stay in the fight.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Self Regenerative, Incorruptible Enterprise" focus area explores the research challenges below, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>(1) Persistent applications (data &amp; state) - The goal of this technology area is to make applications hard to corrupt, disable or remove (like malware). When an attack is successful these applications find a way to keep performing the mission.</p>
<p>(2) Machine Generated Reconstitution - The goal of this technology area is to automatically machine-generate repairs to recover with immunity from errors/cyber attacks.</p>
<p>(3) Reconstitution of Data and State - The goal of this technology area is mission continuation by automatically repairing corrupted data &amp; state to remove residue from errors/cyber attacks.</p>
<p>(4) Understanding Synthetic Diversity or other technology used to recover with immunity - There is a need to better understand the use of synthetic diversity or other technology used to ensure complete attack space coverage and/or understand the effectiveness against various classes of cyber attack.</p>
<p>Funding for the Self-Regenerative Incorruptible Enterprise focus area in FY12 will focus on persistent applications (data &amp; state).</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to: <br />Pat Hurley (315) 330-3624 Patrick.Hurley@rl.af.mil</p>
<p>FY 11 &amp; FY12 FOCUS AREA: CYBER MISSION ASSURANCE</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>This focus is on novel approaches to assure critical Air Force mission essential functions (MEF) in a contested cyber environment. Mission assurance seeks to codify a top-down approach for mapping MEF dependence on cyberspace across the information lifecycle (information generation, processing, storage, transmission, consumption and destruction), identifying cyber vulnerabilities, developing metrics to assess the risk from cyber vulnerabilities on MEF, and developing strategies to mitigate the vulnerabilities. We view mission assurance in the context of preventing and avoiding threats by deterring potential threats through increased costs and reduced benefits.</p>
<p>We seek a scientific basis for mission assurance, including the development of mathematical models to represent MEF dependence on cyber, an exploration of the fractal nature of mission mapping, and the development of metrics for the cost of vulnerability mitigation in proportion to the increased cost to potential threats. These will in turn enable the development of more rigorous approaches to situational understanding as well as command and control.<br /><br />Research into cloud computing technologies could provide potential solutions to the mission assurance research area by increasing the availability and redundancy of continuous or contingency operations. We invite novel techniques for secure data storage, processing and communication practices within a cloud architecture. We seek solutions that utilize the dynamic characteristics of cloud computing technology to prevent and avoid threats. Under the establishment of an internal center of excellence in cloud computing, there is a need for further research within AFRL and the DoD community. The center of excellence should provide opportunities for this research through collaboration and related internships.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>&bull; Create a scientific basis for mission assurance.<br />&bull; Provide novel techniques for secure data storage, processing and communication practices within a cloud architecture.<br />&bull; Construct appropriate research opportunities within the DoD community.<br />&bull; Support other S&amp;T initiatives in the areas of situational understanding and command and control</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to: Dr. Sarah Muccio (315) 330-4016 Sarah.Muccio@rl.af.mil or Mr. Brian Kropa (315) 330-1544 Brian.Kropa@rl.af.mil</p>
<p>The scope of this BAA is not limited to the aforementioned focus areas.</p>
<p>Other applicable areas of technology include, but are not limited to, Rapid/Live Forensics, Botnet Detection &amp; Mitigation, Attack Attribution, Insider Threat Detection &amp; Mitigation, Range Development, and Cyber Modeling, Simulation, Metrics, and Measurements. The work could include 'Abnormality ID and Remediation' and might also include 'Cyber Economic Incentives' which would entail a look at the concept of 'Amortization of R &amp; D' (that is, a look at quantification of how long to pay back R &amp; D resources used for an operational improvement before the R &amp; D/Ops improvement becomes obsolete). Also, Data Mining application under Visualization Support would be applicable.</p>

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>(1) Overall scientific and/or technical merit including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, and understanding of the technical and operational approach for employment of the technology;</p>
<p>(2) The effort's potential contribution and relevance to the U. S. Air Force's mission assurance objectives;</p>
<p>(3) The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, which may include testing of prototype capabilities and assessment against Information Assurance requirements; and</p>
<p>(4) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs, and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIGA will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.<br />Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html<br /><br />VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>

<SUBJECT>Target Exploitation Development and Support (TEDS)
<SOLNBR>FA875005D00370035
<CONTACT>Ms. Bonnie Goetz, Contracting Officer, Phone (315) 330-2008, Fax (315) 330-8080, Email Bonnie.Goetz@rl.af.mil
<DESC><p>This serves as "Notice of Intent" of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate's intent to issue a modification to extend the effective ordering period of the basic contract FA8750-05-D-0037, titled "Target Exploitation Development and Support (TEDS)" on a sole source basis from 7 Apr 2010 to 7 Mar 2011. This contract is being performed by Northrop Grumman Space &amp; Mission Systems Corporation. In addition, a cost-plus-fixed-fee order will be awarded to continue essential operation and maintenance of the Joint Targeting Toolbox (JTT), the Joint Targeting Database (JTDB) and the Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) until the Integrated Targeting Automation Capability (ITAC) and Defense Intelligence Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) Enterprise (DIME) competitive acquisitions (FA8750-10-R-0002 and FA8750-10-R-0157) are awarded. The Air Force plans to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 USC 2304(d)(1)(B), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), to extend the ordering period of the TEDS contract.</p>
<p>The services provided by Northrop Grumman Space &amp; Mission Systems Corporation that must continue without interruption include troubleshooting software problems, testing software patches, on-site training and installation support, life cycle support, on-going exercise support, MIDB Tier 3 Operations Support, and central maintenance facility for JTT and JTDB suite of software applications. Without the capability to provide these highly specialized services, the JTT and MIDB users will quickly experience mission performance degradation and possible mission stoppage. This degradation and downtime which would last for approximately 5 months will prevent users from accomplishing their primary mission: the conduct of Order of Battle production, target development, combat assessment, theater targeting coordination, and support to mission planning for Counter Terrorism, Counter Intelligence, Counter Drug, Counter Insurgency and Cyber missions. A gap in performance of this magnitude will adversely affect mission accomplishment at all combatant commands as well as the functional AOC's and other intelligence community partners. It is impractical to conduct a separate competition to cover the interim period given that competitive solicitations have already been issued for the work and are in process. In addition, waiting for the award of the ITAC and DIME competitive solicitations to continue this support presents an unacceptable 5.5 month delay in fulfilling the government's requirements. As such, there would be significant risk to not only AF, but the Joint community targeting systems if the effective ordering period of the TEDS contract is not extended to allow the award of an order to bridge the gap between the work being performed under the TEDS contract and that of the ITAC and DIME acquisitions.</p>
<p>Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days after the publication date of this notice of contract action. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541710. Inquiries can be mailed to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Bonnie Goetz, AFRL/RIKE, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441 or e-mailed to Bonnie.Goetz@rl.af.mil. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<a href="mailto:betty.clingerman@wpafb.af.mil;antony.susainathan@wpafb.af.mil">betty.clingerman@wpafb.af.mil;antony.susainathan@wpafb.af.mil</a>
<DESC>COMMON VERTICAL LIFT SUPPORT PLATFORM (CVLSP)Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request For Information (CRFI)
INTRODUCTIONThe Air Force is planning to acquire a Common Vertical Lift Support Platform (CVLSP) to replace the current USAF UH-1N fleet.  It is anticipated the USAF fleet of 62 UH-1Ns will all be replaced, with possibly up to 93 air vehicles.  The Air Force is considering an incremental acquisition approach.  The first increment is anticipated to be a production contract beginning in FY12.  To assist in this effort, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capabilities Planning Division (ASC/XRX), Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of providing at least 16 aircraft no later than 30 September 2017.  Additionally, at least six of those aircraft with sufficient training and other support (initial spares, support equipment, data, etc.) to operate those aircraft are required to declare Initial Operational Capability (IOC) no later than 30 Septe! mber 2015.
CVLSP is expected to be an in-production, non-developmental, Government Off-The-Shelf or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) solution.  Meeting schedule is critical and we will consider some performance trade-offs to meet schedule at an affordable cost.  If the solution cannot meet all the capabilities, describe the capabilities your solution can meet if a production decision is made in FY12 and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities.  If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired.  Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities, rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other market information of potential solutions. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS/CRFI.  This SSS/CRFI is part of ongoing Government conducted market research for planning purposes.  It is NOT a solicitation.  The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request.  Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned.  Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition strategy.  All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulat! ions.  In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905.  All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts.  The Government has also determined that their contractor team members have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information.  The Government will not reply to information received.  The Government may conduct follow-on discussions with responders through individual one-on-one and/or collective "industry day" sessions.
PURPOSE The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is (1) to engage industry early in the effort, (2) to identify sources that can provide an Off-The-Shelf (OTS) capability if a go-ahead production decision is made in FY12, and (3) to assist the Air Force in ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with acquisition of the CVLSP capability.  The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition strategy.  The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP. 
RESPONSE GUIDANCEInformation received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such.  Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that 'publicly-releasable' and 'proprietary' information are clearly distinguished.  Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition. 
SSS/CRFI responses should include a: 1.	Cover page containing identification of the company Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, street address, and business size for NACICS code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical Point of Contact (POC) and the overall company POC (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company).2.	Responses are limited to 30 pages and must be received by 22 January 2010.  Responses must be submitted via e-mail with a CD copy by regular mail in text searchable Portable Document Format (.pdf). Responses should be sent to ASC/XRX, (Antony Susainathan,antony.susainathan@wpafb.af.mil) and to the Contracting Officer, Betty Clingerman, 303 AESW/XR, Betty.Clingerman@wpafb.af.mil, 2275 D Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433-7017. 
CVLSP BACKGROUNDThe UH-1N helicopters to be replaced by the CVLSP are employed by various USAF organizations to accomplish a wide range of missions.  The primary mission operation will be in the CONUS, Midwest northern-tier states (e.g., ND, MT, WY), and Washington DC.

<DESC>The Force Protection Branch (ESC/HSSK) has been tasked by Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Directorate (HAF/A7S) to retrofit the Diebold Linx GateMaster System (herein referred to as GateMaster) at Test Site C-3 with the operational configuration of lane-side GateMaster hardware.  Gatemaster is an automated access control system that manages base vehicle gates through scanning driver IDs and either granting or denying access through use of a gate arm. In the proposed project, the suite of lane-side hardware currently in use at Air Force installations shall be integrated into the existing central computing system present at Test Site C-3. The existing Gatemaster lane at Test Site C-3 was installed in March 2009.  GateMaster lane-side hardware consists primarily of a driver ID card reader and a pedestal mounted Tablet PC guard station.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for assistance and technical services to aid inenterprise geographic information system (GIS) planning and implementation to support theSERVIR project in its ongoing efforts to build a web-based geospatial platform.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Spatial Development International(SpatialDev).  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:1. The funds specifically dedicated to establish and expand the SERVIR system in Africaand other geographic regions, were provided to NASA from the United States Agency forInternational Development (USAID) under a Participating Agency Program Agreement. Therequirements and timeframe which have been levied on NASA by USAID necessitate immediateimplementation; thus, the need to use existing system familiarity and expertise isvirtually unavoidable.	SSAI is currently providing technical support for the SERVIRsystem in Africa and has key personnel with nearly 20 years experience in the processing,analysis, management and delivery of multi-source environmental data.2. Advancement of the SERVIR integrated platform is one of the projects highestpriorities. SSAI having been the implementing arm for development of the SERVIRinfrastructure, which includes the integrated platform, brings system familiarity anddesign consistency along with the required expertise readily available to implementrelevant tasks within the time constraint specified in the interagency agreement betweenNASA and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), NASAs fundingpartner for global expansion. Continuing to engage SSAI lessens the risk of failure toimplement requirements per the guidelines set by USAID, which incidentally keeps NASA ingood standing with the USAID and promotes future collaboration.3. SERVIR is a high-visibility project at NASA/MSFC, NASA/HQ and USAID.  It is also themodel in the Americas for the Global Earth Observation System of Systemsa multinationaleffort to build an earth observation system.  It is also a key implementation projectunder the Central American-United States Joint Accord signed by U.S. Secretary of StateColin Powell on June 7, 2001. For these reasons, it is of benefit to NASA to maintain itsaffiliation with an institution like SSAI that is well recognized in the geospatialcommunity and consistently performs exceptionally well amid the high demands that go handin hand with high-visibility.4. SSAI has existing relationships with SERVIRs international partners, the Water Centerfor the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC), which hosts andoperates the SERVIR system in Mesoamerica, and the Regional Center for Mapping ofResources for Development (RCMRD) which hosts and operates the SERVIR system in EastAfrica. These existing relationships will help facilitate the transfer of technology tothe newly dedicated third SERVIR system in the Himalayas.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon December 27, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to CyBio US Inc., 500 W. Cummings Park, Suite 1800, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801-6506 to procure CyBio Well vario system.

Items:

1.  Description:  OL3381-26-500, CyBi-Well vario system, -fs, Item Number: 10, Quantity: 1.00 PCS.
2.  Description: OL3381-27-630,  CyBi-Well vario 25l pipette head 384-f inclusive exchange tool, 1 box CyBi- Tiptray, tip magazine, tip transfer tool, Item Number: 20, Quantity: 1.00 PCS.

The sole source determination is based on the fact the National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The Laboratory of Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease (TRND), a branch of the NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), has a need to purchase an additional CyBi-Well 384 channel simultaneous pipettor for low-volume, high precision liquid transfer. This instrument is needed to expand NHGRIs capability to handle the existing protocols of compound library replication, dilution, and delivery to high-density format assays established by the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), a branch of the NCTT. The implementation of existing technology and protocols will ensure the highest levels of accuracy and experimental efficiency across all laboratories under the NCTT. 

The CyBi-Well fixed head, disposable tip pipettor instrument can be configured with for 384 tips and for volume ranges from 200 nL to 25 L. The pipettor is necessary for making the control compound plates that are needed for assay development and validation. It pipettes and transports the compounds in solution from a 384-well microplate; in 30 seconds and in just four steps, to a 1536-well microplate. Procedures can be quickly and easily programmed with the CyBio software making it favorable in a multiuser environment. The system consists of a 3 position transport system with space for processed plates and other accessories such as tip washing stations or reagent reservoirs, allowing the user to expand on the instrument in order to achieve greater throughput.

NHGRIs screening systems can run up to 300,000 samples a day. The clear identification of microplates is therefore an absolute must in the HTS laboratory environment. This requested system can provide labels up to 240 microplates per hour quickly and reliable  with a high flexibility in barcode definition. The configuration enables the labeling of the plates on the long or on the short side  or on both, depending on user requirements. All of our plate formatting needs (96, 384, 1536) can be used. 

The approved CyBio Control Software allows for filing barcode data in databases, but also the generation of new barcodes by using existing databases. Therefore generated barcodes fit exactly into existing sample storage and retrieval databases. This requested Vario system with its own thermo transfer printer and plate storage system can be operated as stand alone module or integrated into larger compound handling systems currently in use by our labs.  The applications for the CyBi-Well Vario include but are not limited to reformatting, replication, plate coating, biochemical assays, ADME and cytotoxicity assays, compound management, Molecular Biology assays (RNA silencing), and cell handling. All of these applications are relevant to processes and applications currently used in the assay development and validation process for the TRND laboratory.

At the NCGC the existing CyBio instrument has been in heavy use for the past five years and has been serviced once. Furthermore, existing protocols can be readily transferred from the new instrument. This will save us valuable time and resources needed to develop new protocols.  The CyBi-Well Vario includes an automated base which accepts 9 different interchangeable simultaneous pipetting heads.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), with a business size standard of 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-46 (October 29, 2010). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Synopsis:    Bridging Study to Obtain FDA Clearance to Use Magnetic Bead Technology with Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) Analyzer and Reagents<BR>The US Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) intends to issue a contract on behalf of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), Joint Project Manager Chemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS), on the basis of other than full and open competition to Idaho Technology, Inc. (ITI),  390 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, UT  84108.   The purpose of the contract is to conduct a study on the use of Platinum Path Extraction Kits (a magnetic bead process used to extract and purify genetic material) with anthrax, plague, and tularemia biological reagents.  If study results are successful, the contractor will obtain amendments to existing Federal Drug Administration (FDA) clearances wherein an alternate method of extraction was used.  FDA amendments to the clearances will enable the magnetic bead Platinum Path Extraction Kits to be used with the existing Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) analyzer.  The contract is a sole source action under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."   ITI is the manufacturer;  ITI  possesses key proprietary information on the JBAIDS analyzer and the associated anthrax, plague, and tularemia biological reagents;  and ITI is the Sponsor to the FDA of these three cleared diagnostic kits.  FDA regulation 21 CFR Part 820 requires that sponsors of previous FDA clearances be solely responsible for submissions for changes to their approved devices, chemistry, protocols, etc.  For these reasons, the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.   ITI is the only contractor who can meet the government's requirements.   <BR><BR>This notice is not a request for proposals.  However, the government will consider capability statements from interested, qualified parties if they are received prior to the close of this notice.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Capability statements may be forwarded via email to Cynthia.Gnam@us.army.mil or hard copies mailed to Cynthia Gnam, Contracting Officer, 64 Thomas Johnson Drive, Frederick, CA  21702.  No phone inquiries will be entertained.  <BR><BR>Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Idaho Technology, Inc., directly.<BR>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER SINGLE TRACK, LLC.The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  The Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior, Oregon State Office, Portland, Oregon intends to award a sole source Purchase order to Single Track, PO Box 1280, North Plains, OR.  97133.The Bureau requires a specialty trail building machine which will rehabilitate/reconstruct OHV trails that can efficiently and with minimal resource impacts, do the work on tight technical trails that up to this point have only been maintained by hand or by equipment too wide for the trail tread.The Single Track 24 trail Machine is designed to construct and maintain a single track trail (hiking or class 3 OHV) with minimal soil disruption, tree felling, and destruction of the existing trail character, resulting in less resource impacts.  Another feature is that the ST 240 is fully time radio controlled, allowing the BLM to customize safety procedures around the operation, planning and staffing capabilities of the OHV maintenance program.  These controls also allow the operator to work the machine from any angle necessary.  The ST240 can productively go where a manned machine can be severely limited by things such as branches, overhead fall hazards, thorns, bees, and steep side slopes. This machine also comes with an electric winch that will operate with the engine off, if needed, to right the machine.  Unique to this machine, the winch is repositionable, to a top mount location for use as a safety tether on very steep ground.NAICS Code:  333120, Small Business Set-asideTHIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.

Please provide responses no later than 11:59 pm EST,, Januery 10, 2011
<p>2. Background. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) was created under Sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended by Section 110 (P.L. 99-499) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). ATSDR was created to implement the health-related sections of CERCLA as amended by SARA.<br />The mission of ATSDR requires a broad spectrum of public health evaluations including environmental assessment, surveillance, and epidemiologic activities related to preventing or mitigating adverse health outcomes related to hazardous waste and industrial release exposure. As part of its mission, ATSDR is authorized to conduct public health assessment activities such as, but not limited to, public health studies, public health education, public health assessments and consultations, technical assistance, exposure investigations, modeling, exposure dose modeling, historic dose reconstruction, and related community outreach and health education activities. Sites/projects for such assessments, consultations, and/or other public health activities usually are either facilities on the National Priorities List (NPL) established by EPA, Congressional requests, sites/projects where the ATSDR has been petitioned as a result of a hazardous/industrial substance release, site/projects at which activities have been requested by Tribal Nations or other federal, state and local government agencies, or other types of hazardous waste or industrial release sites or projects. The mission of ATSDR requires engagement in these activities to some extent every year. Rather than initiate multiple contracts every year, ATSDR proposes establishing an IDIQ Task Order contract to facilitate procurement of regularly and repeatedly technical and expert consultant services.<br />The scientific, technical, and community outreach and health education activities of ATSDR are often far-reaching, long-term, and require resources outside the scope or capacity of ATSDR. To address ATSDR's limitations in specific areas of function or expertise, ATSDR will procure contract services to support its mission and goals.<br /><br />3. Purpose and Objectives. <br />The purpose of this contract is to provide scientific, technical, and community outreach and health education services for ATSDR in support of its public health mission with regards to public health assessment activities such as, but not limited to, public health assessments, public health consultations, exposure investigations, health studies, health education, training, community involvement, and outreach and evaluation activities. <br />The objective and the unique nature, scope, and complexity of the scientific, technical, and operational services needed to support ATSDR's public health assessment activities will vary from site to site and project to project. Some public health assessment activities may be completed within 12 months whereas other public health assessment activities may require up to five years to complete. Project/site support may include, but not limited to the following activities: data gathering, evaluation, and dissemination, environmental sampling and monitoring and evaluation, data quality control and assurance, analysis, consultation, report preparation, and both general and community logistical coordination. <br /><br />4.

<p>2. Background. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) was created under Sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended by Section 110 (P.L. 99-499) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). ATSDR was created to implement the health-related sections of CERCLA as amended by SARA.<br />The mission of ATSDR requires a broad spectrum of public health evaluations including environmental assessment, surveillance, and epidemiologic activities related to preventing or mitigating adverse health outcomes related to hazardous waste and industrial release exposure. As part of its mission, ATSDR is authorized to conduct public health assessment activities such as, but not limited to, public health studies, public health education, public health assessments and consultations, technical assistance, exposure investigations, modeling, exposure dose modeling, historic dose reconstruction, and related community outreach and health education activities. Sites/projects for such assessments, consultations, and/or other public health activities usually are either facilities on the National Priorities List (NPL) established by EPA, Congressional requests, sites/projects where the ATSDR has been petitioned as a result of a hazardous/industrial substance release, site/projects at which activities have been requested by Tribal Nations or other federal, state and local government agencies, or other types of hazardous waste or industrial release sites or projects. The mission of ATSDR requires engagement in these activities to some extent every year. Rather than initiate multiple contracts every year, ATSDR proposes establishing an IDIQ Task Order contract to facilitate procurement of regularly and repeatedly technical and expert consultant services.<br /><br />The scientific, technical, and community outreach and health education activities of ATSDR are often far-reaching, long-term, and require resources outside the scope or capacity of ATSDR. To address ATSDR's limitations in specific areas of function or expertise, ATSDR will procure contract services to support its mission and goals.<br /><br />3. Purpose and Objectives. <br />The purpose of this contract is to provide scientific, technical, and community outreach and health education services for ATSDR in support of its public health mission with regards to public health assessment activities such as, but not limited to, public health assessments, public health consultations, exposure investigations, health studies, health education, training, community involvement, and outreach and evaluation activities. <br />The objective and the unique nature, scope, and complexity of the scientific, technical, and operational services needed to support ATSDR's public health assessment activities will vary from site to site and project to project. Some public health assessment activities may be completed within 12 months whereas other public health assessment activities may require up to five years to complete. Project/site support may include, but not limited to the following activities: data gathering, evaluation, and dissemination, environmental sampling and monitoring and evaluation, data quality control and assurance, analysis, consultation, report preparation, and both general and community logistical coordination. <br /><br />4.

<DESC>The A/E firm shall, in collaboration with VA staff, accomplish Contract Drawings and Specifications, and provide Construction Period Services to replace the Sterile, Processing & Decontamination (SPD) air handling unit (AHU), exhaust system and associated ductwork to meet current sterile processing standards in the Basement of the main hospital, Overton Brooks VAMC, Shreveport, LA.  The AE firm shall evaluate the existing SPD supply, return and exhaust system and determine the modifications required to meet current SPD air quality flow and distribution requirements.  A/E to collect all data required to support the completed design.  Design to include any required electrical support needed to replace the AHU as well as any balancing and controls work required to tie into our building system automation system for adequate monitoring of the SPD HVAC system.  The design shall also capture all of the necessary modifications to place all of the SPD HVAC equipment on the existing emergency power system. 

The AE shall incorporate the requirements of all applicable codes, including but not limited to, Fire & Life Safety, ADA, National Electric Code, International Mechanical Code, International Plumbing Code, VA HVAC Design Guidance, and other applicable VA Design and/or Construction Guidelines into the design of this project.  

The A/E shall be responsible for designing to achieve sustainable design equivalencies and for implementing within the design the following Guiding Principles found in the Federal Leadership on High Performance and Sustainable Buildings Memorandum of Understanding and the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual:  1. Employ Integrated Design Principles (Integrated Design, Commissioning), 2. Optimize Energy Performance (Energy Efficiency, Measurement and Verification), 3. Protect and Conserve Water (Indoor Water, Outdoor Water), 4. Enhance Indoor Environmental Quality (Ventilation, Thermal Comfort, Moisture Control, Daylighting, Low-Emitting Materials, Protect IAQ during Construction), 5. Reduce Environmental Impact of Materials (Recycled Content, Biobased Content, Construction Waste, Ozone Depleting Compounds).  Sustainable design features, activities and equivalencies are part of overall Federal policy to limit environmental impact and ensure the environmental compatibility of Federal facilities. It is the intent of the VA to make every reasonable and rational effort to meet these requirements. In the event the A/E concludes that implementation of specific sustainability requirements is not feasible (in that doing so creates major negative impacts on the project, including major overall cost increases, major operational feasibility issues, major technology application issues, etc.), a detailed rationale for limiting the use of the specific sustainability feature in question shall be submitted in writing to the Project Engineer for consideration. Such rationale shall include discussion of the significant negative impacts to the project. Cost comparisons and evaluations used in supporting the non-inclusion of required sustainability features must show an overwhelming life cycle rationale. Such exclusions shall not be implemented unless specifically approved by the Project Engineer.

AE shall also incorporate into the design construction bid alternates identified during the design process.  Also identify in the design any phasing required to facilitate construction.  The final cost estimate shall utilize pricing and format established by RS Means CostWorks "Facility Construction Data", most current edition.  Also provide a detailed submittal register for the final design.

The solicitation is to be issued as a 100% Service Disabled Veteran Small Business Set-Aside under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541310.  This Small Business Size Standard is $4.5 Million dollars average annual gross revenues for the past three fiscal years.  This information is only used for classification purposes in the representation and certification portion of the Request for Proposal (RFP).

In accordance with VA Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern agrees that, in the performance of the contract, at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance will be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.  The A/E must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and VetBiz databases.  A/E firms can obtain CCR information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  VetBiz information for registration and confirmation in website can be found at http://www.vip/vetbiz.gov.  By submission of the SF 330, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in and certified in the VetBiz database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from solicitation VA256-11-RP-0143.  A/E is also required to submit Annual Representations and Certifications via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov.  To register in ORCA you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in your CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in contest of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions, and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.  

Firms interested in being considered for this project are to submit their completed SF 330 electronically (copy attached) to Carolyn.Lee3@va.gov no later than 2:00 P.M. local time on December 28, 2010.

This has resulted in a number of urgent procurements over the past several years such as the Quick Reaction Dismounted (QRD) CREW systems, Spiral 2.1 Mounted CREW systems and SYMPHONY Coalition CREW systems.  The Marine Corps is requesting information on systems that will not only be utilized in existing operations but will fill an enduring requirement.
   

2.	  Requirements:  The objective of this RFI is to provide solutions, technologies and state of the art approaches that provide advantages over existing platforms by addressing some or all of the following objectives.

a.	The system should suppress RCIEDs at sufficient distances in order to provide protection to Service Members who are vulnerable to harm from RCIEDs.  The system(s) should be able to be used in dismounted, vehicle mounted or fixed site configuration.
b.	The system should support execution of joint critical operational activities.
c.	The system as a fully functional system hosted on a target platform or when incorporated into an integrated system, should be able to be operated and maintained by service personnel at specified skill levels.
d.	CREW should provide protection capability listed across the threat spectrum.
e.	CREW should be able to operate independently, without the need for off platform/outside control to accomplish its intended tasks.
  It is desirable that CREW be able to receive mission changes updates by either:
i.	Direct Connection:  CREW systems will be able to receive updated mission information via direct connection and pass that information (e.g. daisy chain) to multiple CREW devices.
ii.   Network connection:  Multiple CREW systems will be able to receive updated mission information via a wireless network.  The wireless network would be part of the CREW system or CREW will be able to utilize existing tactical networks without degrading or hindering the existing network asset from performing its intended mission function.
f.	CREW should provide control and networking functionality for two distinct operating modes:
i.	Centralized mode: The EWCC/EW staff is directly controlling the operations of the CREW devices required to support a specific mission.
ii.	Decentralized mode: The EWCC/EW staff indirectly controls the operations by delegating control of the CREW devices required to support a specific mission.
g.	The system should have a programmable capability to record characteristics of identified threat signals, suppression technique employed, time, and location of device.
h.	The system should incorporate hardware and/or software features that reduce unintended emissions such as harmonics, spurious and inter-modulation products to allow the use of open portions of spectrum for the use by other RF spectrum users.
i.	The system should be configurable such that it is compatible with host platforms (man, land transport systems, fixed site) with minimal degradation of host platform performance or mission to include the impact of size, weight and power.
 
3.	Objectives
a.	Operational Availability
b.	Ease of Operation
c.	Suppression of Simultaneous Threats

4.	Responses.
 Incorporate as much detailed information as possible to include, but not limited to:
a.	Technology/System Information
b.	Manufacturer/developer name and description of company competencies
c.	White papers and/or product literature that describe the functionality/capability of the technology or system.

<SUBJECT>84--RFI - Full Spectrum Battle Equipment Improved Armor Carrier Suite
<SOLNBR>M6785411I3011
<RESPDATE>011311
<ARCHDATE>01282011
<CONTACT>Fred Cartes, email: frederick.cartes@usmc.mil

Mark Sanderson, email: mark.sanderson@usmc.mil
<DESC>RFI - Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research, and identifying potential sources and best practice information towards designing, developing, and procuring an Improved Armor Carrier Suite (IACS) that may be incorporated within the Full Spectrum Battle Equipment (FSBE). The IACS will allow the individual Marine to configure and tailor missionspecific armor and load carriage components based on mission requirements. 

 The USMC envisions at this time a suite of carriers that will accommodate Special Operations Forces Personnel Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) profile soft armor and USMC Plate Carrier (PC) profile soft armor. In addition, all carriers must accommodate and integrate with Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPI), Special Operations Forces Personal Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) GEN III Ballistic Plates, Side Small Arms Protective Inserts (SSAPI) with required soft armor backing and/or the SPEAR Modular Supplemental Armor Protection (MSAP) system.
 This suite will enable individual the Marine to configure components to best meet specific mission requirements by optimizing/balancing human factors engineering (e.g. comfort and usability), integration with fielded Load Carriage Equipment (LCE) and cost (production and maintenance).  The notional suite would consist of the following: one (1) Releasable Tactical Vest (RTV), one (1) Releasable Plate Carrier (RPC), one (1) Low-Visibility Tactical Vest (LVTV) and one (1) Low-Visibility Plate Carrier (LVPC) that support/integrate the respective armor cuts, identified hard armor inserts/ancillary armor additions and load carriage systems.
  
The RTV will support SPEAR profile soft armor. The RTV must integrate with the SPEAR MSAP soft armor/pouches (Groin and Deltoid), SPEAR Releasable Ballistic Armored Vest (RBAV) Collar Armor System (CAS) and Improved Modular Tactical Vest (IMTV) lower back protector.
 The carrier will posses PALS webbing for the mounting of modular pouches, have a single pull release located on the center of the vest below the neckline and integrate with the USMC Chest Rig without impeding the quick release of the carrier. The RTV must integrate with the USMC IMTV cummerbund and incorporate it into the release of the system without additional hardware or procedures. The RTV will incorporate an optional internal cummerbund to mitigate load. When used, the internal cummerbund will not interfere with the release of the system. The RTV will provide for an optional cummerbund that must support the carriage of the SPEAR MSAP 6x6 plate and allow for adjustment.

The RPC will support USMC PC profile soft armor.
 The RPC must integrate with the SPEAR MSAP soft armor/pouches (Groin and Deltoid) and IMTV lower back protector. The RPC will posses PALS webbing for the mounting of modular pouches. The RPC will have a single pull release that is identical in location, function and assembly to that of the RTV. The RPC must have the option to be worn without a cummerbund while still maintaining single pull release capability. When worn with a cummerbund, the RPC must integrate with the USMC Chest Rig without impeding the quick release of the carrier. The RPC must integrate with the USMC IMTV cummerbund and incorporate it into the release of the system without additional hardware or procedures. The RPC will provide for an optional cummerbund that must support the carriage of the SPEAR MSAP 6x6 plate and allow for adjustment.

The LVTV will support SPEAR profile soft armor.
 The LVTV must integrate with the SPEAR MSAP soft armor/pouches (Groin and Deltoid), SPEAR RBAV CAS and IMTV lower back protector. The carrier will integrate with the USMC Chest Rig. The LVTV must support the carriage of the SSAPI with soft armor backing and/or the SPEAR MSAP 6x6 plate and allow for adjustment.

The LVPC will support USMC PC profile soft armor. The LVPC must integrate with the SPEAR MSAP soft armor/pouches (Groin and Deltoid) and IMTV lower back protector. The LVPC must have an option to be worn without a cummerbund. When worn with a cummerbund, the LVPC must integrate with the USMC Chest Rig.  The cummerbund of LVPC must support the carriage of the SSAPI with soft armor backing and/or the MSAP 6x6 plate and allow for adjustment.

Berry Amendment compliance will apply to any and all demonstrated designs.
 A limited quantity (i.e. up to 30) of evaluation systems may be requested under a bailment agreement to support user evaluation activities based on market research results. No user evaluations are planned prior to March 2011.

The USMC is currently performing market research to learn applicable/proven best practices (note: the FSBE IACS attributes have not yet been finalized).  Within that effort, the USMC wants to leverage its expertise in USMC operational needs and related constraints with industries established expertise and capabilities to design and develop best value solutions.  Therefore, the USMC is taking the following market research steps:  (1) requesting information from interested companies on best approaches to satisfy the above needs, (2) reviewing industry capabilities to provide updated solutions for in-service components for a previously fielded system.
 

Request that interested parties furnished the Program Management Office (PMO) with written materials concerning their capability to address the above requirements.  Any proprietary information submitted in response to this RFI will be appropriately protected when clearly identified as proprietary. Submissions should not be marked as Confidential, Secret or in accordance with any other security marking related to the classification of government information. These responses should be received not later than January 13, 2011 by sending it to Fred Cartes, at email address frederick.cartes@usmc.mil.  Note: All transmitted responses must be smaller than 5mb.

In accordance with FAR 5.207 (b) (15) (i) and (ii), (i) Except when using the sole source authority at 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. 
(ii) When using the sole source authority at 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. 

Under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1, the VISN 19 Rocky Mountain Consolidated Contracting Center, Denver, CO, proposes to enter into a non-competitive commercial items contract with  Burgess DVM in Ft. Collins, Colorado 80524-1718. This sole proprietor is currently a resident in the Laboratory Animal Comparative Medicine at Colorado State University.

The Veterinary Medical Unit within the Research Service is responsible for the housing and care of research animals at the Denver VAMC (Veterans Affairs Medical Center).   The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) is responsible for reviewing and approval animal research that takes place at the Denver VAMC.

The Eastern Colorado Health Care System (ECHCS), Research Services at the Department of Veteran Affairs, in Denver Colorado has a requirement for a licensed doctor of veterinary medicine (DMV) to provide animal laboratory consulting services to support the Veterinary Medical Unit (VMU) at the Eastern Colorado Health Care System per the VA Handbook policy. 

The Contractor's unique characteristics should include a veterinarian with training and experience in the veterinarian care of animal housed in lab animal research facilities. The experience must include consulting with principal investigators during the preparation of animal protocols, knowledge of research models (rodent and non-rodent), analgesics, anesthesia , and euthanasia procedures in rodent and non rodent species, IACUC policies and procedure, and VMU facility management and VMU operations. 

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within the due date for receipt of proposals will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL TO PROCURE
USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Upon the basis of the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.
The Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 1055 Clermont Street, Denver, CO 80220
Rocky Mountain Consolidated Contracting Center, VISN 19, 4100 East Mississippi Ave, Glendale, CO 80246
2.  Nature/description of action.
This activity proposes to solicit sole source with Burgess, DVM to provide veterinarian animal laboratory services at the Eastern Colorado Health Care System (ECHS). 
3.  Description of Supplies/Services.
Provide a veterinarian to support the Veterinary Medical Unit at ECHS.

The Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center
1055 Clermont Street
 Denver, CO 80220

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.
5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.
See above
6.  Description of Efforts to Ensure Soliciting  of as Many Sources as Possible.
Market research through Ability One and Unicor did not yield these veterinarian skill sets.  Therefore, the acquisition will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site with the intent to sole-source the service. Questions concerning the procurement's qualification as sole-source procurement can be raised by the public at that time. 
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.
The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on the sole-source availability.   It is imperative that the veterinarian have experience with the required previously listed statistical applications and modeling and analytical methods.   Otherwise, the additional learning curve cost would be prohibitive.
 The rate of $100/hr is considered a fair and reasonable cost for the proposed services based on current hourly rate for veterinarians with technical backgrounds, similar positions at the VA, and the additional cost burden to train an individual on IACUC and VA policies, procedures and various systems.  Total expenditure anticipated to be $5000.00.
 8.  Description of Market Survey.
The $100 rate is the equivalent contract rate; benefits are not provided.  
9.  Any Other Supporting Data.
There are no other factors supporting the use of other than full and open competition.      
10.  Listing of Interested Sources.
Burgess DVM
11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.

INVITATION FOR OFFER  FEDERAL NATURAL GAS LIQUIDSIFO NO.  BLM-2010-CHEU-001January 2011  December 2011
IntroductionThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office (AmFO) of the Department of Interior (DOI) is requesting written offers to purchase Federal Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) produced from the Cliffside Helium Enrichment Unit (CHEU).  BLMs CHEU is located in Potter County, Texas, near the city of Amarillo.
The BLM seeks to enter a NGL transportation and sales agreement for NGL volumes that will be advertised and renewed annually.  The NGL will be available at the tailgate of the Cliffside Helium Extraction Unit.  The BLM will produce helium and natural gas in a combined stream from the Bush Dome Helium Storage Reservoir in Potter County, Texas, and separate the products at the CHEU.  The reservoir is about 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas.  The BLM will store the NGL on site for pick up by the successful bidder on this agreement.  The BLM estimates the NGL volumes from CHEU will average 1,000 to 3,000 gallons per day, and will remain relatively steady through the 12- to 15-year life of this project.
NGL pick up is expected to take place during regular business hours 8:00 a.m. 4:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday.  A mutually agreed-to procedure will be established where BLM personnel will contact the buyer for NGL pick up when the storage amount reaches a predetermined level.  The NGL will be stored on site and the buyer will be required to pickup the liquids via truck transport.  The buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs.
Pricing of NGL will be based upon current market values tied to a common spot market (such as Conway, Kansas NGL Trading Hub) and the quality of the NGL.  The NGL at the pickup point is a non-fractionated liquid byproduct.  An automatic sampling system will be an integral part of the installation; however, the analysis of samples will be the responsibility of the buyer.  Operational details of the project (e.g. maps, NGL quality, etc.) are available upon request.  Interested parties are encouraged to contact John Hamak at 806-356-1025 or Nabil Dia at 806-356-1023.
You must submit a written offer via facsimile (fax no. 806-356-1041) by 4:00 p.m. Central Time on December 27, 2010.  We will award the offers by 4:00 p.m. on December 30, 2010.  You may call John Hamak or Nabil Dia with questions about this IFO.
OffersThe Exhibit is the offer sheet containing estimated daily production, preferred index prices, etc.  Your offer, an increment or decrement in relation to the applicable index, should be placed on the offer sheet.  Please note that we are selling all these NGL under a swing obligation on the daily market rather than using a base load and swing component.  The CHEU volume may increase or decrease through the term of this sale although BLM anticipates relatively stable production rates.  
Bidder proposals will be accepted through 14 days after publication or December 27 2010, whichever is earlier.  Please fax your proposals to fax number listed above or mail to the following address:
BLM  Amarillo Field Office801 S. Fillmore, Suite 500Amarillo, TX  79101Attn:  John Hamak
Consideration of OffersBLM may award a contract on the basis of initial offer(s) without discussions.  Accordingly, each initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms that the offeror could submit.  However, BLM may negotiate with offerors in the event offers of similar or unanticipated value are received.
The BLM shall award a Contract resulting from this IFO to the offeror whose offer, in BLMs judgment, is most advantageous to the Federal Government.  BLM will award to the buyer by means of a Natural Gas Liquids Purchase Confirmation Notice, which will also include payment instructions.
Neither party shall disclose directly or without the prior written consent of the other party the terms of any transaction to a third party (other than the employees, lenders, royalty owners, counsel, accountants and other agents of the party, or prospective purchasers of all or substantially all of a partys assets or of any rights under this Contract, provided such persons shall have agreed to keep such terms confidential) except; (i) in order to comply with any applicable law, order, regulation, or exchange rule, (ii) to the extent necessary for the enforcement of this contract, (iii) to the extent necessary to implement any transaction, or (iv) to the extent such information is delivered to such third party for the sole purpose of calculating a published index.  Each party shall notify the other party of any proceeding of which it is aware which may result in disclosure of the terms of any transaction (other than as permitted hereunder) and use reasonable efforts to prevent or limit the disclosure.  The existence of this Contract is not subject to this confidentiality obligation.  The parties hereunder shall keep the terms of any transaction confidential for one year from the expiration of the transaction. 
TermInitial deliveries of Federal NGL to the buyer will commence January 1, 2011  The delivery period will be for a term of twelve months ending December 31, 2011, unless either party cancels the transaction.  
The reasons for which BLM may declare an early cancellation may be, but are not limited to:
(1)	The failure to pay, when due, any payment required under this agreement, if such failure is not remedied within five [5] business days after written notice of such failure, provided that the payment is not the subject of a good faith dispute and the buyer pays BLM such amounts as it concedes to be correct; (2)	Any representation or warranty which is proven to have been false or misleading in any material respect when made or deemed to be repeated; or(3)	The failure to provide adequate financial assurances to BLM.
Transportation and Planning of Natural Gas LiquidsThe buyer agrees to take 100 percent of the Federal NGL delivered at the delivery point for the entire contract period.  BLM will use reasonable efforts, consistent with industry practice, to inform the buyer regarding significant changes in NGL production levels and production shut-ins.  The buyer, through customary industry, will communicate directly with BLM.  The buyer, at its expense, shall make all necessary arrangements to receive delivery of Federal NGL at the delivery point.  The buyer is not responsible for costs of transportation upstream of the delivery point, nor is it responsible for storage costs of the Cliffside facility.  However, the buyer will be responsible for all transportation costs during and after pickup of the NGL from the plant site.
No later than eight (8) calendar days before the first day of each month, BLM will notify the buyer of the weekly liquid volumes and quality anticipated for the following month of production.  The buyer understands that any such estimate is not a warranty of actual deliveries to be made, but is provided to facilitate planning of delivery of Federal NGL.  This will continue for each month of the delivery period.
Liquidated DamagesBLM will remarket the NGL in the event an early contract termination occurs.  BLM will collect from the terminated party an amount equal to the positive difference, if any, between the contract price less the price at which BLM is able to remarket the NGL not purchased, using commercially reasonable efforts in an arms-length transaction.

<p>An Overview of the Ratings System</p>
<p>A series of risk ratings summarize the in-depth analyses and forecasts provided in each Country Report, consisting of 50-70 pages. Each Country Report must provide the current level and likely changes of the following 17 risk components (12 in the 18-month forecast and five in the five-year forecast), which are also used to compile the risk scores.</p>
<p>18-Month Risk Factors</p>
<p>Twelve factors are analyzed from an 18-month forecast perspective, including political turmoil, which is included in both the 18-month and the five-year forecasts.</p>
<p>Turmoil. Actions that can result in threats or harm to people or property by political groups or foreign governments, operating within the country or from an external base:</p>
<p>* Riots and demonstrations <br />* Politically motivated strikes <br />* Disputes with other countries that may affect business <br />* Terrorism and guerrilla activities <br />* Civil or international war <br />* Street crime that might affect international business personnel <br />* Organized crime having an impact on political stability or foreign business</p>
<p>Not included in turmoil are legal, work-related labor strikes that do not lead to violence.</p>
<p>Equity Restrictions. Limitations on the foreign ownership of businesses, emphasizing sectors where limitations are either especially liberal or especially restrictive.</p>
<p>Operations Restrictions. Restrictions on procurement, hiring foreign personnel, or locating business activities, as well as the efficiency and honesty of officials with whom business executives must deal and the effectiveness and integrity of the judicial system.</p>
<p>Taxation Discrimination. The formal and informal tax policies that either lead to bias against, or special advantages favoring international business.</p>
<p>Repatriation Restrictions. Formal and informal rules regarding the reparation of profits, dividends, and investment capital.</p>
<p>Exchange Controls. Formal policies, informal practices, and financial conditions that either ease or inhibit converting local currency to foreign currency, normally a firm's home currency.</p>
<p>Tariff Barriers. The average and range of financial costs imposed on imports.</p>
<p>Other Import Barriers. Formal and informal quotas, licensing provisions, or other restrictions on imports.</p>
<p>Payment Delays. The punctuality, or otherwise, with which government and private importers pay their foreign creditors, based on government policies, domestic economic conditions, and international financial conditions.</p>
<p>Fiscal and Monetary Expansion. An assessment of the effect of the government's spending, taxing, interest rate and other monetary policies. The assessment is based on a judgment as to whether the expansion is inadequate for a healthy business climate, acceptably expansionist, or so excessively expansionist as to threaten inflation or other economic disorder.</p>
<p>Labor Policies. Government policies, trade union activity, and productivity of the labor force that create either high or low costs for businesses.</p>
<p>Foreign Debt. The magnitude of all foreign debt relative to the size of the economy and the ability of the country's public and private institutions to repay debt service obligations promptly.</p>
<p>Five-Year Risk Factors</p>
<p>Four additional factors are analyzed from a five-year forecast perspective. (Turmoil is included in both the 18-month and the five-year forecasts.)</p>
<p>Investment Restrictions. The current base and likely changes in the general climate for restricting foreign investments.</p>
<p>Trade Restrictions. The current base and the likely changes in the general climate for restricting the entry of foreign trade.</p>
<p>Domestic Economic Problems. A country's ranking according to its most recent five-year performance record in per capita GDP, GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, capital investment, and budget balance.</p>
<p>International Economic Problems. A country's ranking according to its most recent five-year performance record in current account (as a percentage of GDP), the ratio of debt service to exports, and the annual percentage change in the value of the currency.</p>
<p>These 17 factors are used in the summary risk ratings, first estimating the current risk level of each factor and then forecasting the change in its risk level under each of the three most likely regime scenarios. The numerical equivalents of these current and forecast levels are then used to calculate the risk scores.</p>

<DESC><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541519.  The requirement is for the following McCabe items:
<p>CLIN 0001: Renewal of Maintenance for 56 McCabe 1Q Maintenance, M-IQ-Server, Period of Performance February 01, 2011 - January 31, 2012</p>
<p>CLIN 0002: Renewal of Maintenance on 56 McCabe IQ Linux Extension Software, Period of Performance February 01, 2011 - January 31, 2012</p>
<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: NGA has a requirement for the brand name software licenses and annual software maintenance coverage as outlined above. All of the products referenced in this posting are proprietary products of McCabe. The McCabe suite of software has already been integrated into the NGA enterprise.  Due to this fact, it would be extremely costly to switch to a different type of software.   Personnel would have to be trained to use the new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to the implementation of the software.  The McCabe IQ Software suite is the only software suite that fulfills the salient features of this requirement at this time.</p>
<p>NOTE:  In order to submit a quote, you must be the manufacturer or an authorized reseller for Curious Software.  <br />SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS:<br /> <br />Delivery will be made to:<br />ATTN:  Carol Tankersley <br />NGA Arnold<br />Mail Stop L-063<br />3838 Vogel Rd <br />Arnold, MO 63010<br />Carol.J.Tankersley@nga.mil</p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />Renewal of Matlab Software Licenses For 12 Months
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number <br />NRMJ2000-11-02180SRG.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-46.</p>
<p>(IV) The procurement is unrestricted and open to all sources. The associated NAICS code is 811219. The small business size standard is $6.5 million.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial services and items:<br />Renewal Of Matlab Software Licenses For 12 Months, Commercial Term:Perpetual with a Period of Performance 1/1/11 - 1/1/12.</p>
<p>Justification for Brand Only: "MATLAB is a mathematical analysis and processing package used by many of the PSD researchers in their day-to-day research. It is considered the de-facto standard for matrix manipulation and certain types of mathematical analysis. PSD currently has 20 floating (i.e. network accessible) licenses for the MATLAB program, along with a number of licenses for auxiliary (toolbox) software. While and open source equivalent does exist, PSD scientists have found significant differences between programs written for MATLAB and those that work in the open-source equivalents." NOAA has "downloaded and installed various open-source and freely available alternatives to the MATLAB package", but ran "into compatibility issues with existing legacy code with all these packages." Therefore MATLAB Software is the only brand that meets the Government requirements. And only authorized dealers may submit quotes to be considered for this requirement.</p>

The contractor will provide a detailed inspection procedure focusing primarily on the most critical weld joints and bolted connections.<BR><BR>6.	Gate Timing Adjustments. (OPTIONAL)<BR>In the pump mode the units are set up for opening the wicket gates as fast as possible. This could be contributing to the vibration problems. The contractor will develop and submit a detailed, step by step procedure for increasing this gate timing in the pump mode, without affecting the generation mode timing.  Once the Government implements the gate timing adjustments the contractor will monitor one pump unit during several start ups, with different gate times, and recommend an optimal setting based on analysis of the data.<BR><BR><BR><BR>Copies of equipment drawings, measurements, and the root cause report will be made available upon request.  The contractor shall provide all equipment and labor necessary to complete the work identified in this scope.  Use of Government equipment will not be allowed.

In order to provide all necessary information for a comprehensive technical evaluation and price analysis, offerors must submit a proposal in three (3) separate sections and be clearly and concisely written as well as being indexed and logically assembled.

Offerors should provide a complete narrative for each element listed under the Technical Approach Subfactors as stated below.  NOTE:  Statements that "the Offeror understands", "can or will comply with all specifications", statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as "standard procedures will be used" or "well known techniques will be used" will be considered insufficient and could render the proposal as unacceptable.<BR><BR>	b.

PART 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR <BR><BR>a.  Offeror's Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR 52.212-1, instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, will be used to make a determination of the level of performance risk associated with each offeror.  Offerors should provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for at least three prior contracts that are similar in size and scope and complexity to this requirement,  performed within the last five (5) years.  References should also be provided for any anticipated subcontractor to be used.   Offerors should provide the following:<BR><BR>		Reference:  Name, Address, POC and phone Numbers<BR>		Contract, Value, and Dates:<BR>		Description of the Contract Effort:<BR>                             Relevance to this Solicitation:<BR>	<BR>b.  Each Offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior efforts for similar services .  The offeror may include an overall narrative explaining what aspects of the contract efforts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, as well as significant accomplishments and difficulties.   Offerors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all information and the Government does not assume the responsible for conducting research as a result of incorrect reference information of any kind.  The references should be provided in descending order, with the most relevant contracts appearing first.<BR><BR>               c.  Performance information will be used for both the  responsibility determination  as well as an evaluation factor.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.<BR><BR>                d.  Offerors may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate exceptional capacity to provide the service or product described in Performance Work Statement.<BR><BR>                e.

The Offeror's Price proposal must consist of the signed copy of the SF 1449 and total prices for the services requested for the Base and Option Periods included on the Continuation Page of the SF 1449.  It is expected that this contract will be awarded based upon a determination that there was adequate price competition; therefore, the offeror is not required to submit or certify cost or pricing data.  However, after receipt of proposals, if the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition does not exist in accordance with FAR 15.804-3, the offeror shall be required to provide cost or pricing data.<BR><BR> <BR>5.  BASIS FOR AWARD:<BR><BR>	a.  Award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose proposal contains the combination of those criteria offering the best overall value to the U.S. Government, in accordance with FAR 15.101-1.   The Government reserves the right to consider only those proposals submitted in accordance with all instructions set forth or referenced in this solicitation.  A proposal that omits material elements required by the RFQ may be eliminated from further consideration.

The evaluation will be based on a complete assessment of each Offeror's proposal.  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the Evaluation Factors/Criteria identified above.  It is important that Offerors possess a complete understanding of what each factor requires and accurately interprets their relative order of importance when preparing proposals in response to this solicitation.  The cumulative relative importance of the non-pricing evaluation factors is significantly more important when compared to the pricing factor.<BR>  <BR>              c. Evaluation Factors are in descending order of importance with the Technical Approach Factor being significantly more important than Past Performance Factor.  Subfactors listed under Technical approach are of equal importance.<BR><BR>d.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions.   IAW with FAR 15.101-1(2), the evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. <BR><BR>    	e.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>(End of clause)<BR><BR><BR><BR>Wage Determination for Schofield Barracks, HI (See Attachment)<BR>Wage Determination for Fort Belvoir, VA (See Attachment)<BR>Wage Determination for Fort Bragg, NC (See Attachment)<BR>Contract Manpower Reporting Clause (See Attachment)<BR><BR>Clauses may be accessed electronically in full text through http://farsite.hill.af.mil or www.acquisition.gov/far.

<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred. If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT RESULT IN AN ORDER AGAINST A FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE. ANY OFFER WHICH IS PREDICATED UPON THE AWARD BEING PLACED AGAINST AN FSS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.</p>
<p>The purchase of 1 each, Agilent Network Analyzer, Model # N5230-125<br />1 each, Agilent ECAL Module, Model # N4691B<br />2 each, Unique ID Labels (UID)</p>
<p>Mfr: Agilent Technologies, INC.<br />Justification for Brand Name Only: This piece of equipment is configured for Depot use only in the repair of two specific items of RADAR Avionic equipment for the F-15 Aircraft. Although other manufacturers have similar network analyzers, this brand name and model number should be purchased to preclude costly re-engineering test set configuration changes. Engineering has been funded to development of three additional test programs that require the use of a network analyzer. The requirement of the network analyzer was driven by the units under test (UUT) test specifications and the Agilent N5230C was chosen because it meets all test requirements. The Agilent N5230C provides commonality with other program(s) that we support. Engineering has invested approximately 2000+ hours in development of these test programs. If any other network analyzer is purchased; engineering will have to rewrite/reintegrate the test programs and the shop will have to revalidate the test programs. The estimated amount of engineering/testing costs to find other possible Network Analyzers that would work in this application would negate any cost savings of buying any other brand of Network Analyzer and the shop will experience unacceptable delays in production because of software changes and maturation testing.</p>
<p>Price(s) shall be FOB Destination (Robins AFB GA 31098). In addition to price and delivery, quote should include your cage code, DUNS number, and taxpayer ID number. Requested delivery date is 30 days ARO or earlier.</p>
<p>Quotations should be emailed to SSgt James Kaari (james.kaari@robins.af.mil) no later than 03 January <br />2011, 4:00 pm EST.</p>
<p>The following clauses are applicable to subject solicitation (current through FAC 2005-45 dated 1 Oct 2010 and DFARS Change Notice 20100802):<br /><br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors<br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items <br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items <br />FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items<br />FAR 52-212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7001<br />FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination<br />DFARS 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation (Appl if unit price exceeds $5K.)<br />DFARS 252.232.7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (WAWF is the method used by DoD for processing invoices/receiving reports.)</p>

<SUBJECT>Renewal of Matlab Software Licenses For 12 Months
<SOLNBR>NRMJ2000-11-02180SRG

<ARCHDATE>12212010
<CONTACT>Suzanne A Romberg-Garrett, Phone 303-497-5110, Email suzanne.garrett@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>Corrected Mod 1</p>
<p>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />Renewal of Matlab Software Licenses For 12 Months</p>
<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number <br />NRMJ2000-11-02180SRG.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-46.</p>
<p>(IV) The procurement is unrestricted and open to all sources. The associated NAICS code is 811219. The small business size standard is $6.5 million.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial services and items:<br />Renewal Of Matlab Software Licenses For 12 Months, Period of Performance 1/1/11 - 1/1/12.</p>
<p>Justification for Brand Only: "MATLAB is a mathematical analysis and processing package used by many of the PSD researchers in their day-to-day research. It is considered the de-facto standard for matrix manipulation and certain types of mathematical analysis. PSD currently has 20 floating (i.e. network accessible) licenses for the MATLAB program, along with a number of licenses for auxiliary (toolbox) software. While and open source equivalent does exist, PSD scientists have found significant differences between programs written for MATLAB and those that work in the open-source equivalents." NOAA has "downloaded and installed various open-source and freely available alternatives to the MATLAB package", but ran "into compatibility issues with existing legacy code with all these packages." Therefore MATLAB Software is the only brand that meets the Government requirements. And only authorized dealers may submit quotes to be considered for this requirement.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROT</strong>ESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half St. SW, JR11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593</p>

<DESC>The Air Force is planning to acquire a Common Vertical Lift Support Platform (CVLSP) to replace the current USAF UH-1N fleet.  It is anticipated the USAF fleet of 62 UH-1Ns will all be replaced, with possibly up to 93 air vehicles.  The Air Force is considering an incremental acquisition approach.  The first increment is anticipated to be a production contract beginning in FY12.  To assist in this effort, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capabilities Planning Division (ASC/XRX), Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of providing at least 16 aircraft no later than 30 September 2017.  Additionally, at least six of those aircraft wit! h sufficient training and other support (initial spares, support equipment, data, etc.) to operate those aircraft are required to declare Initial Operational Capability (IOC) no later than 30 September 2015.
CVLSP is expected to be an in-production, non-developmental, Government Off-The-Shelf or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) solution.  Meeting schedule is critical and we will consider some performance trade-offs to meet schedule at an affordable cost.  If the solution cannot meet all the capabilities, describe the capabilities your solution can meet if a production decision is made in FY12 and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities.  If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired.  Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities, rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other market information of potential solutions. This moves the information originally posted here to an attachment.

<DESC>The Air Force is planning to acquire a Common Vertical Lift Support Platform (CVLSP) to replace the current USAF UH-1N fleet.  It is anticipated the USAF fleet of 62 UH-1Ns will all be replaced, with possibly up to 93 air vehicles.  The Air Force is considering an incremental acquisition approach.  The first increment is anticipated to be a production contract beginning in FY12.  To assist in this effort, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capabilities Planning Division (ASC/XRX), Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of providing at least 16 aircraft no later than 30 September 2017.  Additionally, at least six of those aircraft with sufficient training and other support (initial spares, support equipment, data, etc.) to operate those aircraft are required to declare Initial Operational Capability (IOC) no later than 30 Septe! mber 2015.
CVLSP is expected to be an in-production, non-developmental, Government Off-The-Shelf or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) solution.  Meeting schedule is critical and we will consider some performance trade-offs to meet schedule at an affordable cost.  If the solution cannot meet all the capabilities, describe the capabilities your solution can meet if a production decision is made in FY12 and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities.  If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired.  Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities, rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other market information of potential solutions. THE FULL TEXT OF THE RFI ORIGINALLY POSTED IN THIS SECTION IS NOW INCLUDED AS AN ATTACHMENT.

<DESC>VA-243-11-RQ-0046    RFI Responses
1.	Request - How are replacement parts to be paid for? Some of the parts that may require replacement range in price from $200 to $1500 in price. Can a cost plus item be added on the bid sheet?

Answer - the scope currently reads:

The contractor shall furnish all material, labor, supervision, tools and equipment necessary to provide a full preventive maintenance program, including all inspections, adjustments, tests, parts replacement and repairs necessary to keep the equipment in continuous use at their initial performance ability as originally specified by the equipment manufacturer, and as modified thereafter.  All adjustments, repairs and modifications must be in strict compliance with regulatory agencies.

The scope of work is hereby changed to the following:

The contractor shall furnish all material, labor, supervision, tools and equipment necessary to provide a full preventive maintenance program, including all inspections, adjustments, tests, parts replacement and repairs necessary to keep the equipment in continuous use at their full performance ability as specified by the equipment manufacturer and as modified thereafter. All adjustments, repairs and modifications must be in strict compliance with regulatory agencies. Any part replacement or repair less than $2,500.00 is the responsibility of the contractor. Any part replacement or repair $2,500.00 or more must be approved in advance by the COTR and Contracting Officer will be billed at the labor rate specified in the price schedule and parts will be billed at actual invoiced price.

2.	Request - In the event the sump has water in it and breaks the sensor, who is responsible for pumping out the sump? If it is the contractor how do we get paid for it and how does the contractor get paid for the replacement part?

Answer - The contractor shall furnish all material, labor, supervision, tools and equipment necessary to provide a full preventive maintenance program, including all inspections, adjustments, tests, parts replacement and repairs necessary to keep the equipment in continuous use at their full performance ability as specified by the equipment manufacturer and as modified thereafter. All adjustments, repairs and modifications must be in strict compliance with regulatory agencies. Any part replacement or repair (time and material) less than $2,500.00 is the responsibility of the contractor. Any part replacement or repair (time and material) $2,500.00 or more must be approved in advance by the COTR and Contracting Officer.

	Work Excluded:	The following work is specifically excluded from this contract.

A)	Repair or replacement made necessary due to the negligence or misuse of the equipment by persons other than the contractor, his/her representatives or his/her employees. If the sump has water in it due to the negligence of VA then the contractor would be paid per the labor rate specified in the pricing schedule. Parts will be billed at actual invoiced cost. If the sump has water in it and it is through no fault of VA then the contractor would be responsible to pump the sump and complete the repair if less than $2,500; if $2,500 or more than a task order amendment would be negotiated, issued and the contractor would be paid accordingly.

The Contracting Officer must approve, in advance, any extra charge work attributed to vandalism or misuse.  No invoice will be paid without prior approval.

Any repairs due to misuse or negligence shall be billed according to the labor rate specified in the pricing schedule.  (Premium Portion Only for Overtime Work).  Parts will be billed at actual invoiced cost.

3.	Is this work covered under local law 220 prevailing wage? If so what wage classification do we classify the person? Is bonding (bid P&P) required for this work?

Answer - This is a services contract; the Service Contract Act applies and is included in the solicitation for both counties in NY (Dutchess and Westchester).  Bonding is not required for this contract as it is not a construction contract.

4.	Section E scope item 3 requires us to install and maintain a storage cabinet on site. What size cabinet do we require? I am assuming you require 2 cabinets, one at each location? Upon completion of the contract is the cabinet and materials the possession of the contractor?

Answer - An adequate supply of spare parts shall be maintained at all times to ensure prompt preventive maintenance and repair services. Callback service consists of responding to service call and beginning to take corrective action within seven calendar days.  Equipment malfunctions shall be corrected the same day that the service call was issued.  If circumstances beyond the control of the contractor preclude resolution of the problem that day, the COTR must be notified with an explanation of the delay.

Under no circumstances will any shutdown or breakdown last longer than five (5) working days (forty (40) working hours) from initial notification to the contractor, without prior approval of the COTR.

The contractor shall provide all supplies and shall furnish metal storage cabinets in location selected by COTR for spare parts, waste and flammable materials associated with the performance of this contract.

CABINET(S) OF SUFFICIENT SIZE AND STOCKED TO MEET THE ABOVE CRITERIA WOULD BE NEEDED. THE CONTRACTOR SHOULD SPECIFY THE SIZE AND WHAT THEY PLAN TO STOCK THE CABINET WITH IN THEIR PROPOSAL. YES ONE CABINET AT EACH FACILITY FOR PARTS AND MATERIAL AND ONE OR MORE FOR FLAMMABLE MATERIAL AND WASTE. ON COMPLETION OF THE CONTRACT THE MATERIAL AND CABINET(S) ARE THE POSSESSION OF THE CONTRACTOR. HOWEVER, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY AT ITS OPTION PURCHASE THE CABINET AND PARTS CONTAINED THEREIN FOR ACTUAL INVOICE PRICE.

5.	The wires installed are not up to current manufacturers' requirements. Are we responsible for the wires as well?

Answer - The following performance levels shall be maintained at all times: Equipment shall be maintained as originally installed and adjusted.  Excluded from the scope is replacement of underground portions of the system. If the wires currently installed are not to current manufacturers requirements but are as originally installed and were installed to the manufacturers' requirements at that time. NO.

6.	During the visit 2 day tanks were on the list that had no form of leak detection. Are we responsible for them as well? If so what are we required to do? 

Answer - The contractor will not be responsible for any tank without a Leak Detection system. If at a later date the US Government requires leak detection to be installed on any other tank; that would be at a price agreed on in advance with the vendor as a task order amendment or completed through a separate contract.

7.	How many rolls of paper are we required to provide for the VR?

Answer - A sufficient quantity to ensure uninterrupted printing capability. 

8.	Are we required to perform maintenance on the gasoline and diesel dispensers?

Answer - NO - any work that may be required on the gasoline and diesel dispensers would be a task order amendment at a price agreed on in advance or completed through a separate contract.

9.	At Montrose, the VR for tanks 4A, 5A and 6A appear to be in poor shape. Will this VR be replaced under the tank replacement project? Is the tank contractor responsible for final terminations?

Answer - At the present time, the tank replacement project does NOT call for the replacement of the VR. It calls for adding additional channels and if that isn't feasible then the replacement of the VR. All work necessary due to the tank project will be the responsibility of the tank contractor. This includes the addition of channels, programming, final terminations etc. The successful bidder on this contract will be responsible for the preventive maintenance, inspection and testing the new system or the old system as modified upon acceptance from the tank replacement contractor and the expiration of any warranty period thereof.


Please note the following contract clause:

	REMOVAL OF EQUIPMENT FROM SERVICE

When the Medical Center removes one or more, equipments named in this contract, from service because of renovations or to perform work that is outside the scope of this contract, the monthly payments due the contractor may be reduced.  The contractor shall be notified, in writing, by letter or contract modification of the AST/UST Veeder Root systems being removed from or returned to service.  If the equipment is to be removed from service for thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, Contracting Officer will negotiate an equitable adjustment with the contractor and make the necessary adjustments on the monthly invoice when authorizing payment.  If the equipment is to be removed from service for more than thirty (30) consecutive calendar days, Contracting Officer will issue a modification to the contract and negotiate an equitable adjustment in the contract price in accordance with the Change clause.  The period for reducing payments will begin on the effective date specified in the notice and will continue through the day before the equipment is returned to service.

10.	Since the Veterans Administration has apparently already contracted for the initial testing and repair of the systems it is currently soliciting bids for maintaining, may the bidder for the Preventative Maintenance and Inspection Project assume that all of the involved equipment and systems will be tested and inspected and brought into full compliant/operational status by others, or failing that, may the bidder assume that the initial repair or replacement of any defective or non-compliant equipment and systems will be performed by others, or as an extra to the contract based on the actual cost of materials, equipment and labor, and contract allowable mark-ups for extra work?  

Answer - NO
11.	The contract documents can be interpreted to require the bidder to perform repairs and replacements to systems and equipment that are beyond the normal repair and or replacement of the tank monitoring systems, including the storage tank equipment and related piping, wiring, pumps, etc. Is the intent of the contract to require the bidder to include the repair or maintenance of anything beyond the actual monitoring equipment itself I.E. sensors, probes, monitors, etc.?

Answer - Yes the successful bidder on this contract shall be responsible for all sensors, probes, monitors, wiring, piping etc. ancillary to the VR unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this contract. The contractor will have no responsibility for the repair; maintenance or testing of the actual above ground or below ground storage tanks. 

12.	To our knowledge, Veeder Root equipment can only serviced/repaired by a company/distributor that Veeder Root has certified for such work. Must the bidder be so certified as a necessary requirement for submitting its bid?

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; mso-layout-grid-align: none" align="center"><strong><span style="COLOR: black">Request for Information (RFI) Radio Frequency Identification Solution</span></strong></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">I. Description:</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotes. In accordance with FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback concerning its submission. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The Government is not seeking proposals at this time. Additionally, the Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Note that responses should not take the form of a proposal and will not be understood as such. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned. Full requirements will not be provided. This RFI is intended to provide the Government with market research.<strong><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">II. Strategy:</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">A Customs and Border Protection (CBP) strategic goal is to become more efficient for IT asset management: to be able to effectively count, locate and track asset movement within the datacenter. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Although this RFI is focused on data center IT assets, near term solutions must be expandable to other non-IT assets including planes, boats, firearms, canines, horses, non intrusion technology.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">CBP would like to perform a Proof-of-Concept (POC) to confirm RFID usage at the data center is feasible and can support asset management of data center assets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the POC is successful, CBP would like to grow the use of RFID within the organization to support asset management. The information derived from the Request For Information would allow CBP to plan a Capability Demonstration and develop a Concept-of-Operations (CONOPS). Dependant upon the progress and information obtained during the POC, CBP reserves the right to change direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The POC should show how manual asset validation, which requires too much labor and only addresses lost assets after the fact, can be eliminated or significantly reduced.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-list: none; mso-list-ins: 'Nick Martinelli' 20101130T1355"><span><ins datetime="2010-11-30T13:55" cite="mailto:Nick%20Martinelli"></ins></span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">III. Purpose:</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">CBP has a significant number of IT assets that must be managed effectively. The primary requirement for asset management is to properly identify these assets. Manufacturer bar codes and CBP-applied asset number tags are two ways assets are currently identified. The serial numbers link the asset to CBP's inventory tracking system. These labels are both labor intensive in nature and support a limited amount of information for the asset.</span><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black">Therefore, CBP initially seeks an IT RFID Asset Tracking Solution, which provides both real-time location visibility with rules-based alerting and reporting of critical or highly valued equipment and material with a guaranteed 100% in room level accuracy as well as the necessary middleware to provide passive location services for fixed or expendable assets. This capability must interface with existing COTS solutions within the CBP enterprise and this capability needs to be expandable for assets other than IT.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">As part of this effort, CBP is gathering information on technology that can address one or more of the following objectives:<strong><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objective #1</span>: RFID inventory enterprise management system.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
As required by FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Urgency

1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center, 5000 W. National Ave. Bldg. 5, Milwaukee, WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  One month Rental of a Mobile MRI (housed in a mobile coach) on an emergency basis for the Jesse Brown VAMC, Chicago, IL.  Procurement will proceed on an emergency basis with Advanced Imaging Management.
		    
3.  	A Description of Supplies/Services required:  The Jesse Brown VAMC requires the one month rental of a Mobile MRI (Siemens Magnetom Symphony 1.5 Tesla MRI Scanner, house in a mobile coach) while the current MRI system is being upgraded.  This system is required for continual and uninterrupted direct patient care for approximately 150 MRI exams per day which also include numerous critically ill patients who are not able to be transferred to other facilities for testing. The rental of the Mobile MRI is estimated to cost approximately $55,000.00.
  
4.	Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2(a)(2).  The VA's need for the supply is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless VA is permitted to limit the number of sources. (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2)).

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  Unusual and compelling urgency. The Mobile MRI unit must have all of the required hookups, software, and equipment to provide emergent delivery required for uninterrupted direct patient care.  The unit must be able to fit into the docking area/parking pad without any upgrades.  This is the only cost effective option for the facility to continue uninterrupted MRI exams.  Outsourcing MRI procedures will also diminish the standard of care by causing serious delays in order to receive timely diagnoses.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  The Small Purchase Center and Contract Service Center conducted research and concluded there were no viable GSA contracts for the product. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Price was compared and confirmed with the end user for the same or similar type requirements and is comparable.

8.	Market survey conducted:  The Contract Service Center researched GSA and no vendors were found for this product.  Since this is an emergency request, no further market research was conducted.   

9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  In the future, the station should identify research projects, plan ahead and identify special equipment needs before they become an emergency.  

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

Based upon information received from the station, we concur that it is in the best interest of the government to proceed with the emergency procurement with this firm.
