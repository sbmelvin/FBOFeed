<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with BCF Designs Ltd., Cirencester, England.  The Government intends to procure interface cable/adapter sets to be used with Fuel Quantity Test Set (FQTS) under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, as BCF is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and sole source designer, manufacturer, and integrator of the FQTS at this time.  The FQTS is a portable test set used to test fuel quantity probes and indicators of various Navy and Marine Corps aircraft to verify that aircraft fuel quantity gages are indicating correct fuel levels.   BCF is currently under contract with the U.S. Navy to develop and test ten pre-production FQTSs.  As the drawing package for system development and integration is still being developed by BCF, the Government does not currently possess the data necessary to provide for the production and integration of the interface cable/adapter sets; therefore, BCF is the only source who can accomplish the requirement in the necessary timeframe as the OEM would be able to work on the FQTS platform integration and production cable/adapter sets concurrently.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the government will consider all responses received to this notice.  A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>This notice provides an amendment to combined synopsis/solicitation FSA-NSLDS-11052004.  The following language is added as clarification under item 8, Description, as a result of questions received from interested parties:

This procurement is for a Commercial Item as set forth in 48CFR12.  Therefore, these services must currently be offered by the vendor, i.e., vendor will currently have access to Student Loan Data and currently offer it for sale commercially.  This acquisition is not for the maintenance or for the development of a system.  It is for the reporting of student loan data that the vendor currently makes available to other entities, including Guarantee Agencies, financial institutions, etc.  No software or Government Furnished property of any kind is being provided to vendors.  The vendor is responsible for having developed a relationship and all interaction with the schools.   Schools and other institutions are not required to interface with vendors, therefore, vendors that do not have this pre-established relationship with the vast majority of institutions will not be considered.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on the basis of technical, price, delivery, and past performance.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the quality and specification strength in the area of the Offeror’s technical proposal (offeror shall include detailed product description as specified above that highlights specifications and qualifications).  Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.
