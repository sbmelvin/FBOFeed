<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS ISSUED AS A DRAFT RFP ANNOUCEMENT FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. This notice DOES NOT constitute a Request for Proposal or complete package outlining the technical competencies/qualifications of the prospective contractor, nor does it represent any commitment by the Government. Since this is a Draft RFP announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this announcement. A solicitation does not presently exist.<br /><br /><br /><br />-------- DRAFT --------<br /><br />FROM: 772 ESS/PKD<br />
<p>139 BARNES AVE, BLDG 1120<br /> TYNDALL AFB FL 32403</p>
<p><br />SUBJECT:   Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Small Robot - Request for Proposals (RFP)</p>
<p>1.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>2.  This requirement is being solicited as full and open competition.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 334511 and the Small Business size standard is 750 employees.  All proposals must include a small business subcontracting plan, if applicable.</p>
<p>3.  Basis for Award.  772 ESS intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) requirements contract to the contractor who is determined to propose the best value to the Government, for performance of all the tasks required in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>4.  Best Value Evaluation.  For this procurement, the Best Value determination will be made on a trade-off basis.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers:  A) Price, B) Technical Approach, and C) Past Performance.  Trade-offs may occur between Factors A) Price and B) Technical Approach.  The evaluation factor of Technical Approach is significantly more important than the evaluation factor of Price.  Factor C) Past Performance will be evaluated as Acceptable or Unacceptable.  The responses to this RFP are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions unless discussions are deemed to be necessary.  The following process will be followed:</p>
<p>A.  Price. Total evaluated price will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Price Sheet by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN).  The extended amounts for each CLIN will then be totaled to obtain the total for each performance period.  The extended total for the basic performance will then be added to the extended total for each Option period, to obtain the total evaluated price.  Evaluation of option prices will not obligate the Government to exercise options.</p>
<p>B.  Technical Approach.  This factor will be determined through government testing of the proposed system and evaluation of how well the proposal meets the requirements outlined in the SOW.  The offeror's proposal must adequately describe their approach to meeting the Government's needs of maintenance logistics.  The technical capabilities of the system will be evaluated through the two phase Government testing as described in the Testing Plan (Attachment 2).  A system that does not meet the Key Performance Parameters (KPP's) will not be eligible for award.</p>
<p>C.  Past Performance:  The offeror shall provide examples of past performance (contract number, location, POC, contact information) for services performed in the last three (3) years.  Recent and relevant Past Performance will be evaluated based on an assessment of performance under previous contracts.  Relevant Past Performance is defined as efforts involving similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  In conducting the Past Performance evaluation, the Government reserves the right to use both the information provided in the offeror's Past Performance proposal and information obtained from other sources available to the Government, to include Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers and Fee Determining Official; the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and commercial sources. The Government will evaluate past performance as it relates to the SOW requirements.  Past Performance will be evaluated as either Acceptable or Unacceptable.  A rating of Unacceptable will render a proposal ineligible for award.  A lack of Past Performance will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably and will therefore be evaluated as Acceptable.<br /> <br />5.  Price Sheet.  The CLIN pricing structure in the Price Sheet (Attachment 3) is based on the estimated number of purchases each year.  Contractors are required to fill in the unit price for all CLINs identified in the Price Sheet.  Failure to fill in all spaces for unit and total CLIN in the Price Sheet will render the offer unacceptable and the Government will not consider the offer for award, in the absence of discussions.  The Unit Price should be rounded to the penny to avoid rounding errors; be consistent with the pricing submitted on the proposal, including any discounts.  The Price Sheet Spreadsheet in this workbook is not to be altered except for filling in the unit prices proposed for each labor category.  Extended totals will be automatically calculated by the spreadsheet.  Since the Government intends to award without discussions, contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing.  Failure to comply with instructions will render the quote Unacceptable and ineligible for award in the absence of discussions.</p>
<p>6.  Testing Instructions.  Offerors are responsible for providing a system for Government evaluation and testing.  Evaluation and testing will occur in two phases:</p>
<p>Phase 1:  Offerors are responsible for delivering a system to the AFCEC facility on Tyndall AFB by the proposal due date in Paragraph 7.  If shipping via conventional mail services, ship to the Contracting Officer, ******* at ****************************.  Please contact the Contracting Officer if intending to use other delivery options.  Delivery is FOB destination and is at the offeror's expense.  The Government is responsible for any robotic system once it has arrived on site.  Offerors should include any training material required to use the system.  Offerors may, but are not required to, have a representative on site prior to testing for training and demonstration purposes.  Once tested and evaluated, approximately 5 systems will be chosen to advance to Phase 2.  Systems that do not advance to Phase 2 will be shipped back to the offeror at the Government's expense.</p>
<p>Phase 2:  The Government will transport the five chosen systems to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) facility in Gaithersburg, MD for further evaluation.  Offerors are highly encouraged (though not required) to send a representative to run their system through the tests.  Systems will be tested and then shipped back to the offerors at the Government's expense.</p>
<p>7.  Additional Instructions to Offerors. Vendors shall respond to this RFP via email by *******************.  All proposals should be sent to the Contracting Officer, **********, at ********* before the due date and time specified.  Any proposal, modification, or revision of a proposal received after the exact time specified for receipt of quotes is "late" and may not be considered.  Contractors are authorized to submit up to two proposals and/or systems.</p>
<p>All offers must list your DUNS number, CAGE code, and Federal TIN with Company name, POC, and phone number. If you need to obtain or renew a DUNS number or CAGE code, please visit https://www.sam.gov.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an Offeror ineligible for award.</p>
<p>Vendor must also be registered in Wide Area Work Flow to receive payment through electronic funds transfer.  If you are not currently registered, please visit the following website https://wawf.eb.mil/ to complete your registration.</p>
<p>8.  Questions.  All questions regarding the RFP package must be submitted to the above e-mail address by ****************.  Any questions asked over the telephone will not be answered.</p>
<p>9. Organizational Conflicts of Interest: All offerors shall identify any conflict of interest or appearance issues that might be a potential Organizational Conflict of Interest.</p>
<p>10. Notice to Offeror:  The Government reserves the right to cancel this RFP, either before or after the closing date.  In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs.  Submitted offers shall be valid for 90 days after the closing date of the RFP.</p>
<p>11.  Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s):  Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of quotes. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs.</p>

<DESC><br />The Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis to ABB Inc, 29801 Euclid Avenue, Wickliffe, OH 44092-1832 for a supply project consisting of purchasing a new prefabricated 19" Control Cabinet with one MPS III Power Supply (ABB Part No. P-HA-RPS-CH100000 Power Supply Chassis, P-HA-RPS-PEP11013 Single Chassis Power Entry Panel, P-HA-RPS-FAN03000 System Cooling Fan, P-HA-RPS- 32000000 Power Supply units) with two (2) BRC410 Controllers manufactured by ABB (Catalogue Number SPBRC410), including module mounting units, communications modules, input/output modules and termination units for Arnold AFB, Tennessee.<br />&nbsp;
<p>This project requires procurement of an expansion auxiliary cabinet for the control system at Steam Plant A. The steam utilities at AEDC use ABB Symphony/Harmony Distributed Control Systems (DCS) to operate the plants. These controls are required as the Steam Plants cannot be operated manually. The additional control cabinet will provide extra control system capacity to allow the steam plant to monitor and trend critical parameters in real time. The expansion cabinet will include redundancy for the power, communications, and controller modules. It will include the capability to monitor sixty-two (62) analog inputs and sixty-four (64) discrete inputs. The estimated period of performance is 180 calendar days after contract award.</p>
<p>This synopsis is approved for a sole source contract action as authorized in FAR 6.302-1. No proposal or solicitation package will be issued. However, all interested sources may identify their interest, but must provide proof of the capability to provide an acceptable product by submitting an accurate description of the equipment offered, make and model numbers of the equipment, pricing data, and warranties. Only written emailed inquiries submitted to the email address of henry.daniels.2@us.af.mil containing this data will be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Award will not be made on the basis of responses received to this synopsis. <br /><br />If no favorable responses are received by 2:00pm CST on December 29, 2014, a contract will be negotiated with the above named source. The Government will not be responsible for any costs in the preparation of responses to this announcement.</p>

EVALUATION FACTORS:

Note: Failure to address all evaluation factors in sufficient detail may result in a low a rating. 

1.	Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required service.  The education, training, registration, certifications overall, relevant experience, and longevity with the firm of the key management and technical personnel should be provided. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel.

Contractor should also have experience in HVAC and Plumbing, Architectural, Civil, Structural, Electrical and Mechanical engineering disciplines. Specialized experience in Interim Life Saving Measure (ILSM), and ICRA is beneficial.  Specialized experience on similar projects and their technical capabilities (such as design quality management procedures, HVAC design, and hospital project design, energy efficiency design procedures, facility electrical design, structural reinforcement and seismic loading) of the prime firm and any subcontractors is beneficial.  Provide a detailed narrative of up to 5 (maximum) relevant projects completed within the last 5 years that best illustrate overall team experience relevant to this projects scope.  List projects including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, HVAC control and design, architectural, plumbing, electrical and civil design, project control, medical facility design work and estimating effectiveness
3.	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Projects similar or greater in scope, size and magnitude is beneficial.  The full potential value of any current A/E contracts that a firm has been awarded will be evaluated. For the Prime and each proposed consultant to be assigned to the team, list the larger current projects being designed in the firms' office. Indicate the firms' present workload and the availability of the project team (including sub-consultants) for the specified contract performance period.  Describe experience in successfully delivering projects per performance schedule, providing timely construction support, and successfully completing multiple projects with similar delivery dates.
4.	Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Information will be obtained through the CPARS Government Past Performance Information System.    Contractors are required to provide three past performance questionnaires directly to the Contracting Officer.  The contractor must provide the entire past performance questionnaire to each of its assessors.  An individual assessor knowledgeable of the contractor's quality of supplies and services rendered is requested to verify, complete the questionnaire, and submit to Joseph Cowan at joseph.cowan@va.gov.   If evaluating more than one contract for the same contractor, use a separate questionnaire for each contract being evaluated.
5.	Location in general geographical area of the projects and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of the criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  Contractor must have an office within 180 miles of Louisville, Kentucky.  Examples of knowledge of the locality include knowledge of geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique.  
6.	Energy Conservation/Sustainable Design Experience and Credentials.  List all design members who have LEED AP credentials.  List examples of projects designed with minimum LEED silver certification for projects with similar size and scope.

<RESPDATE>122914
<CONTACT>Robert J. Corno, Contract Specialist, Phone 2406695151, Email robert.corno@nih.gov - John Manouelian, Contracting Officer, Phone 2406695152, Email manouelj@mail.nih.gov
<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases. The Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic is growing worldwide at an alarming rate and has disproportionately affected the health, economic development and political stability of many of the world's poorest and most vulnerable populations. To combat this global threat and to prevent the spread of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection, the NIAID supports biomedical research to increase the basic knowledge of the pathogenesis, natural history and transmission of HIV disease, and to evaluate new and improved approaches for the detection, treatment and prevention of HIV infection and its complications.</p>
<p>NIAID accomplishes this through planning, implementing, managing and evaluating programs in the following: (1) fundamental basic research; (2) discovery and development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications; and (3) discovery and development of vaccines and other prevention strategies. The significant majority of these activities are housed in NIAID's Division of AIDS (DAIDS) with limited support provided to other organizational components of NIAID. The NIAID HIV/AIDS programs must be built with flexibility and coordinate across NIAID with other organizations, in order to permit rapid, efficient and scalable responses to emerging scientific and clinical opportunities.</p>
<p>A signification portion of the work carried out by DAIDS is the oversight of the design, implementation, conduct and oversight of clinical trials and clinical studies supported through grants, contracts and interagency agreements. This includes NIAID-sponsored Phase I, II, III, IV and post-marketing trials of HIV therapeutic, vaccine and prevention clinical research. NIAID currently supports clinical research efforts through large clinical networks, individual single or multi-site grants, and partnerships with other Federal and non-Federal agencies. NIAID is currently supporting approximately 400 trials related to HIV and AIDS in various stages. These trials range from 10 to 6,000 participants and are conducted in more than 40 countries. Approximately half of the countries are resource poor.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span></strong></p>
<p>The Division of AIDS currently supports a contract for NIAID HIV/AIDS Scientific and Operations Support" under contract number HHSN272200800014C with Henry M. Jackson Foundation (HJF). The purpose of the contract is to provide scientific, technical and operational expertise for NIAID HIV and AIDS research, and particularly clinical research activities that are conducted as part of grant and contract awards. The scope of activities include: (1) Clinical Research Support; (2) Program Operations Support; (3) Communications Support; (4) Conflict of Interest Mitigation, Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Plan; (5) Project Management; and (6) Final Transition. The Contractor provides critical support in areas such as laboratory monitoring, assay development, scientific and medical expertise, clinical site training, clinical trial planning and evaluation, clinical trial pharmacy support and oversight, clinical site monitoring, support for clinical trials' Data Safety and Monitoring Boards (DSMBs), clinical trial safety reporting of Adverse Events to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), etc.</p>
<p>The purpose of this follow-on extension is to continue to provide scientific, technical and operational expertise for NIAID DAIDS HIV and AIDS research and particularly clinical research activities that are conducted as part of grant and contract awards. The scope of activities included in the extension related to this notice are only those functions of the original contract that are deemed as critical/essential.</p>
<p>The NIAID intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1, on a sole source basis, with HJF to extend the existing contract period of performance for a six month period from March 1, 2015 through August 31, 2015, and to include an option to Extend Services to allow extension of the contract for an additional 6 month period from September 1, 2015 through February 29, 2016. No other source is able to provide these critical/essential services beginning on March 1, 2015 without causing unacceptable delays to the Government in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement. All capability statements received within fifteen days from the date of the publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request For Information (RFI) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.
<p>Caution:<br />This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for conducting IFT for AETC. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined. Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.</p>
<p>Introduction:<br />1. This request for information (RFI) includes a description of the IFT requirement and a Contractor Capability Survey, which allows you to provide your company's capability.<br />2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)<br />3. Marketing materials are considered an insufficient response to this RFI.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
<p>FRAUD PREVENTION SYSTEM (FPS)</p>
<p>Purpose of Notice:</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE posted for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY and will be used to assist the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in determining the availability of eligible Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HUB Zone, women-owned small business, and 8(a) with the technical capability necessary to successfully perform the requirements described herein.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERIVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.</p>
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY TO OBTAIN CONTRACTOR SUPPORT SERVICES TO PERFORM THE SAME OR SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTICE. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) MAY OR MAY NOT ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE SUBMISSION OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT; ACCORDINGLY, CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THE RESULTS OF THE MARKET RESEARCH. THE CONTRACT IS ANTICIPATED TO BE COST PLUS AWARD FEE (CFAF). THE CONTRACTING OFFICE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO AWARD ANY OTHER TYPE OF TASK ORDER DETAILED INFORMATION IS PROVIDED VIA THE DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK WHICH IS POSTED ON THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified small businesses that can provide an IT development and data services solution in support of the CMS requirements for the FRAUD PREVENTION SYSTEM (FPS).</p>
<p>Prior to engaging in procurement activity to acquire vendors for the Fraud Prevention System potential businesses will need to demonstrate the ability to provide the services defined in this notice.</p>
<p>Background<br />The loss of taxpayer dollars through waste, fraud, and abuse drives up health care costs. CMS is pursuing an aggressive program integrity strategy that will prevent fraudulent transactions from occurring, rather than simply tracking down fraudulent providers and pursuing illegitimate claims. CMS' program integrity mission also encompasses the operations and oversight necessary to ensure that CMS makes accurate payments to legitimate providers and suppliers for appropriate, reasonable, and necessary services and supplies for eligible Medicare beneficiaries. Reversing the traditional pay- and-chase approach to detection and prevention is the main goal of the National Fraud Prevention Program, a long-term, sustainable approach that incorporates innovative technologies in integrated solutions.</p>
<p>Working with qualified vendors, CMS hopes to decrease those inefficiencies by:</p>
<p>A. Plan and execute a tailored development approach to complete design, development, testing and implementation of the predictive modeling system, and iterate with continuous refinements of the modeling system and output reports during the Base Year.</p>
<p>B. Design the system to operate using software and IT infrastructure compatible with the CMS IT environment and enterprise architecture and in accordance with the CMS system development framework and security.</p>
<p>C. Maintain CMS Authority to Operate (ATO) and/or CMS interim ATO for hosting the predictive modeling system and/or authorization using CMS data sources and business intelligence at the Contractor's facility.</p>
<p>D. Generate and coordinate delivery (daily or more frequently) output reports in the format(s) accepted for use by all stakeholders. The reports shall target preventing payment of claims identified as having high risk of fraud, waste, or abuse until claims are validated.</p>
<p>E. Continually test and refine the predictive modeling system and integrity of the results to minimize false positives, refine the taxonomy of classifications, score the issues to support prioritization and continuously improve the model and/or edit based on user feedback.</p>
<p>F. Define agreed to metrics to measure implementation results and outcomes that can be computed and reported directly from the predictive modeling system.</p>
<p>G. No later than 30 days prior to completion of each performance period, deliver a draft Summary Report addressing all findings and results of the predictive modeling system including assessment for future use, limitations, scalability, recommended areas for capability improvements, observations on any CMS data limitations, and areas for further investigation and development. Revise and submit a completed Summary Report that incorporates CMS feedback prior to the end of the Task Order.</p>
<p>H. Support users of the predictive analytic reports with any needed interpretation of finding and address user feedback. The type and level of user support shall include telephone and email support as directed by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>I. Implement a system/tool that enables review and tracking of predictive model/edit outputs and results by all CMS partners supporting enrollment, payment processing, investigations, audit, and enforcement.</p>
<p>J. Business Intelligence Reporting Tools (Dashboard) connect to the live FPS2 system and allows drill-down capabilities to claims level.</p>
<p>K. Integrate edit module in the claims authorization processing and document the change order request to permit implementation of Edits.</p>
<p>L. Incorporate the ability to suspend claims for review by the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC)</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance<br />The government expects that the final contract for this body of work will be for a base period of 12 months and four (4) twelve month option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>1. Introduction

This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Responses to this RFI must be in writing. The purpose of this RFI announcement is for market research to make appropriate acquisition decisions and to gain knowledge for budgetary planning. Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition. Responses to this notice shall include the following: (a) company name (b) address (c) point of contact (d) phone, fax, and email (e) DUNS number (f) Cage Code (g) Tax ID Number and Small Business Status (SDVOSB/VOSB/8A/HubZone/Minority Owned/etc) (h) must provide a capability statement that addresses the organization's qualifications and ability to perform as a contractor for the work described below:

2.  Background

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides a wide array of health care services to eligible veterans and, in some cases, their families, for service-connected and non-service connected health care needs.  For non-service-connected care (not a result of injuries/illnesses incurred during military service), VHA is authorized to retain collections from Third Party insurance payments and First Party copayments; these collections offset the annual medical care appropriated funds.  A major responsibility of the Chief Business Office (CBO) is to monitor, track, and collect these funds.  The Business Information Office (BIO) within CBO Revenue Operations is the business line that sets up targets and reports on the billing and collection activities of both traditional VA and Non-VA Care.
The mission of BIO is to transform data into business information and business information into business intelligence.  Leveraging people, processes, and technologies supports effective decision-making at all levels of the organization. Using predictive modeling, BIO develops a 10-year Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) collection forecast and allocates the MCCF collections' expected results (ER) at the station level annually to support the President's Budget.  BIO's data gathering and report creation processes can be described as "A set of methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights for decision making."
BIO currently has a reporting solution that retrieves information from at least ten different places across the nation.  Each feed provides data at various times, in various formats, processed differently, and is sometimes incomplete.  




Diagram 1:  High Level Data Feeds

 
In addition BIO's current data storage and reporting system are depicted in the diagram below:

?
Diagram 2: BIO's Data Storage and Reporting System
 
3.  Statement of Objectives
BIO's goal is multi-faceted:
1.	BIO will take data from multiple VA sources, harness relevant data and analyze it to find answers that enable 1) trend analysis, 2) Smarter business decision making 3) Determine root causes of failures. 
2.	BIO is the authoritative source for VHA's revenue reporting  and therefore will continue to provide a clear and accurate depiction of the true facts and numbers
3.	BIO will develop the data management standard that other organizations can use as a role model
4.	BIO will provide a solution that can be replicated and expanded; to develop additional performance management reporting
5.	BIO will provide data analytics support for business operations across the end-to-end VHA revenue cycle.

?
4.  BIO's Reporting System
	
BIO seeks to improve its capabilities in the area of enterprise-wide gathering of pertinent financial data, related business data for revenue cycle activities, and the preparation of revenue-based statistics and collection results.  BIO also wishes to create data models, trend analyses, and ad-hoc reports from the enterprise-wide data it collects.  BIO seeks advice and assistance in the area of hardware, operating system, software and data governance to achieve these goals.

The government seeks industry feedback on the following key areas of Management and Operations:

a)	Improving BIO's Information Processes
b)	Managing Business Data
c)	Publishing Business-Critical Information
d)	Mobile Technology Capabilities (if available)
e)	Cybersecurity

The following sections provide background on the above-mentioned areas and specific questions for which government is seeking industry responses.

4.1 Improving BIO's Information Processes
The government's approach to modernizing BIO's information processes is to specify only minimal requirements sufficient to develop an accurate, consistent, and timely reporting capability that presents highly formatted information in a consistent, user-friendly manner. At a minimum, the solution will support advanced reporting, scalability, trending analysis, data modeling, and rapid query performance.  The government would like to view all options for data gathering, reporting capabilities, trend analysis, and data modeling.  For example, should a cloud solution be used? Is there new technology that can be utilized? Are there other alternatives? Etc.  

4.2 Managing Business Data
The government needs to obtain raw data from its origin, which is VistA, (Veterans Integrated System Technology Architecture).  VistA is VA's award winning Health Information Technology (IT) system. Presently, selected VistA files are either extracted by VA's VistA Data Extract (VDE), Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) or information is obtained via customized extracts, etc.  (See Appendix A)  VistA provides an integrated inpatient and outpatient electronic health record for VA patients, and administrative tools to help VA deliver the best quality medical care to Veterans.  However, VistA is a complicated system.  There are tools being used to pull data from local VistA systems currently.  Some of the tools are proprietary to specific vendors.  BIO's strategy is to (1) obtain, (2) transport, (3) store, (4) and utilize data in the process of creating reports, data modeling, data mining, and trend analysis.    There are terabytes of raw data and statistics available, but understanding the needs of the organization, and the story that needs to be told will determine which data elements are needed. BIO will have the ability to bring data together in a way that tells the correct story to the stakeholders and to the organization.

4.3 Publishing Business-Critical Information
BIO monitors the revenue operations' collections and co-payments and provides that information to executive management via reports and dashboards.  This published information is critical for informed decisions by VHA management and to meet target goals issued by BIO needed to fulfill the President's budget. BIO's intent is to improve current capabilities and expand reporting abilities. For example, there may be time sensitive reporting requirements necessary to support intradepartmental and interdepartmental initiatives and strategies.  BIO's reporting processes need to accommodate new and emerging requirements with efficiency and timeliness.

4.4 Mobile Technology
The government would be interested in hearing mobile technology capabilities as an add on in the future.

4.5 Cybersecurity
It is necessary to provide security measures around data used.  Some data contains Personal Health Information (PHI). Even though data is aggregated, there could be some associations made.  Cybersecurity measures would need to align with Federal and VA policies. 

5.  Infrastructure
Currently, BIO mainly uses the business data from the VistA Data Extract (VDE) to support performance measurement for revenue operations. Additionally, some reports are developed using the data from the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) (See Diagram 2 below).  BIO is considering using the CDW as the primary source to pull data, but the CDW capabilities are being developed and more research is needed to determine if CDW will have all data needed for BIO's reports and analysis.  Alternative methods of gathering raw data from VistA need to be addressed.  The new infrastructure would depend on the solution taken by the government. 

Diagram 2:   CDW Visual
 


5.1 Equipment
BIO does not own any equipment.

5.2 Host Site
Current data storage, data warehousing and business reporting system are  being hosted in the Allocation Resource Center  (ARC) in Braintree, Massachusetts as a courtesy (i.e., no funding required).  The RFI should include a wide variety of alternatives in the area of hardware and site hosting with cost estimation.  The new solution may need to be hosted elsewhere in the VA or at a site that would allow all authorized VA auditors to come in as required by specified VA schedule. Any host site must be within the VA's firewall. The BIO team is currently conducting research on data centers in the VA, and would like the most appropriate fit to its needs.

5.3 Integration 
Integration of platforms may need to be a consideration.  All raw data is derived from VistA.  VistA is written in MUMPS (Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System) or alternatively M; a general-purpose computer programming language that provides ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable) transaction processing.  Interoperability may need to be addressed and solution must be able to communicate via various platforms if automatic data delivery is part of a proposed solution.  Use of HL7 may be one solution if data transmissions from the sites to a central location become an option.

6.  Instructions for Responding to this RFI
Respondents are encouraged to be as specific as possible in addressing the RFI and in providing suggestions for alternative approaches and solutions.  Feedback of a general or non-specific nature is less useful and will have limited utility in refining the acquisition strategy and affecting the content of the RFP.

Interested parties may respond to this RFI in accordance with the instructions provided in this section.  Table 1 below provides guidance for preparing responses.

<DESC>TITLE: <br />New Structures Lab Support Services
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND:<br />The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) maintains and operates several structural research laboratories at the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC) in McLean, Virginia. The general purpose of the structures research laboratories is to support FHWA's strategic focus on improving mobility through analytical and experimental studies to determine the behavior of bridge systems under typical and extreme loading conditions. These experimental studies may also include tests of bridge systems developed to enhance bridge durability and constructability over time. Data from these studies help upgrade national bridge design specifications and improve the safety, reliability, and cost effectiveness of bridge construction in the United States. The structural research laboratories also provide bridge failure forensic investigation services to State Departments of Transportation, FHWA Division Offices, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and others. Through the forensic service and non-destructive evaluation (NDE), the laboratories determine the causes of bridge structural failures and develop practices and procedures to help avoid similar failures from occurring in the future.</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS: <br />The FHWA has a requirement for non-personal on-site and off-site engineering and technical services to support research activities in the structures laboratories at the TFHRC. The successful Contractor shall provide staff with the expertise necessary to maintain and operate the laboratories in an efficient, cost-effective, and innovative manner. At a minimum, the needed expertise will include: Metals, Concrete and NDE engineering. The Contractor shall also maintain a strong, multi-disciplinary scientific and engineering base responsive to technical issues of importance to the FHWA structures research program. The Contractor's management team shall integrate excellence in laboratory operation, business operation, and research management with sufficient technical depth to perform world-class research. Work under the contract shall include the performance of analytical studies, laboratory testing, field testing of highway bridge structures, finite element modeling, materials sampling and testing, research reports, and the publication of research papers. Field testing and research at in-situ bridge locations, as well as work at outside research facilities shall also be performed under the contract. Additional work related to the structures program includes NDE. Work in these areas is required to support the structures program research agenda.</p>
<p>The estimated period of performance for the project is five years. FHWA anticipates a level of effort ranging from 20 to 24 professional and technical staff members per year for the duration of the project. The level of activity will greatly depend on continued and additional funding under current and future transportation legislation.</p>
<p><br />REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:<br />This requirement is a new procurement. The contract type and contract vehicle is to be determined.</p>
<p>ELIGIBILITY:<br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 with a Small Business Size of $15.0 million.</p>

<DESC>This new requirement acquisition stems from previous national sports marketing contracts which created increased brand awareness, leveraged numerous social media platforms, and through onsite activation enabled recruiters the ability to have quality engagement opportunities with prospective applicants.  However, previous contracting information is not being provided as the Government views this requirement as entirely new and seeks innovative tasks, deliverables, and performance standards.  <br>  <br> Historically, there has also been a requirement to have sporting events/activations serve as a high-school and college entry vehicle.  The purpose is to use the sports industry to gain access to high schools.  <br>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION</span>:</strong> The Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology (DHS/S&amp;T) Directorate, is requesting information from industry in order to refine procurement strategies, gather input regarding best practices, and to identify qualified, experienced sources interested in performing the services for the stand-up, management and operations of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). This information will be used by the Government in the development of the overall acquisition strategy.<br />&nbsp;<br />NBAF will be a state-of-the-art biocontainment facility for the study of foreign animal, emerging and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases that threaten the U.S. animal agriculture and public health. NBAF will provide and strengthen our nation with critical capabilities to conduct research, develop vaccines and other countermeasures, and train veterinarians in preparedness and response against these diseases. For the past 60 years, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) has served our nation as the primary facility to conduct this research. However, PIADC is nearing the end of its life-cycle and will be replaced in order to meet U.S. research requirements and ensure the timely development of countermeasures in the event of an outbreak. NBAF meets that need and will serve as a replacement for the PIADC facility. Strategically, NBAF will boast of new and expanded capabilities, specifically, large animal biosafety level 4 (ABSL-4) containment for the study of high-consequence diseases affecting large livestock. The mission of NBAF includes:<br /><br />&bull; Providing enhanced research capabilities to diagnose foreign animal, emerging and zoonotic diseases in large livestock<br />&bull; Providing expanded vaccine and countermeasure development capabilities for large livestock<br />&bull; Replacing and expanding research currently done at the PIADC in New York, and continuing the partnership between the Department and the USDA Animal Research Service (ARS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).
<p>Additional information regarding the NBAF program, mission, site, facility and timeline can be found at www.dhs.gov/national-bio-and-agro-defense-facility.</p>

<SUBJECT>Attribute Based Access Control Solution
<SOLNBR>DJJD-15-RFI-0909
<RESPDATE>011215
<CONTACT>Tara M. Jamison, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-307-1959, Email tara.jamison@usdoj.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Justice (Department or DOJ), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Access Control Program Office is required to deploy an enhanced Information Technology (IT) authorization solution across various networks, based on federal mandates.  The required enhanced IT authorization solution will implement a logical Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) System that will dynamically grant and revoke user access rights applications and files using digital policies (rules) based on attributes (specific characteristics) that are assigned to users, applications, and files.<br /><br />The DOJ is in the planning stages for procurement of a solution and associated deployment support services that will meet the federal requirements.  The DOJ is seeking a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) solution (hereafter referred to as "ABAC Solution") that adheres to the methodology described in NIST Special Publication 800-162 Guide to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations (NIST SP 800-162) and Recommendations for Implementing Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM).<br /><br />The Department currently uses a variety of different methods to enforce access control, dependent on the application and network domain.  Access control infrastructures within DOJ vary widely, however, the majority of the applications enforce access control decisions internal to the application itself and are based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC) models or use Access Control Lists (ACLs).<br /><br />The DOJ seeks information from industry about how to move towards a more centralized access control model, with the access control decisions being made external to the application.  Other features of interest include the ability to provision attributes of subjects (including Non-Person Entities (NPEs)), objects (metadata), and environmental conditions in order to enforce digital policy decisions based on those attributes and manage the digital policies and data tagging or marking (See RFI Section 3, Statement of Need).

<DESC>INTRODUCTION: <br> The Pilatus PC-12NG is a single-engine turboprop passenger and cargo aircraft manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft of Switzerland. The PC-12NG aircraft has been modified by Sierra Nevada Corporation to support counterterrorism (CT) and counternarcotics (CN) operations in Afghanistan. This is the third request for information (RFI) / sources sought posted for this effort. The requirement for Contractor Onsite Technical Support in Afghanistan has been removed and it will only require initial set up and instruction of the requested items in Afghanistan. <br>  <br> The Afghan National Security Force (ANSF) lacks PC-12NG training devices, training aids, and equipment necessary for different types of mission/training capabilities in support of CT and CN operations. <br>  <br> To address this training deficiency, the U.S. ARMY Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is soliciting information from Contractors capable of providing the following types of training products. Specification and PWS are attached to this posting. Below is an overview of what is expected. If there is confusion between the below remarks and the specification, the specification take precedence. <br>  <br> 1) Full Color, Wall-Hanging Systems Illustrations: <br> Large (approximately 3 ft x 6 ft) wall-mounted PC-12NG system description charts that are in full color with intricate detail.

<DESC>PROJECT INFORMATION <br>  <br> This is A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT to be used for Market Research ONLY, to determine the availability of firms capable of performing environmental services and support at Tooele Army Depot, North.  NO AWARD will be made from this Sources Sought. NO SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; therefore, do NOT request a copy of a solicitation.  All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition method for a potential future acquisition. We encourage all firms to respond, including but not limited to, HUB Zone, 8a, SDVOSB, Small Business and Large Business. <br>  <br> This would be a regional requirement with some requirements falling outside South Pacific Division (SPD) boundaries, however, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be located within the boundaries of SPD.  The SPD includes both military boundaries (CA, NV, UT and AZ) and civil works boundaries (CA, NV, AZ, UT, NM and portions of OR, ID, TX, CO and WY). <br>  <br> 1.	PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  Groundwater Treatment System Demolition. Tooele Army Depot-North (TEAD-N) operated a large (~10,000 gpm) groundwater extraction, treatment, and injection system from approximately 1994-2004.  The system has been determined to be ineffective and unnecessary and is no longer needed per TEAD-N's Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) Post-closure Permit, modified and approved July 28, 2014 (the Permit). <br>  <br> 2.	CAPABILITIES AND QUALIFICATIONS: <br>  <br> a.	Qualified personnel are required with recent knowledge and experience in: <br>  <br> 1)	Development and stakeholder approval of a work plan detailing how the decommissioning of the system will be accomplished to meet all regulator and stakeholder concerns; <br> 2)	Cleaning, characterization, demolition and disposal (to include recycling and reuse as appropriate) of treatment plant building and all associated equipment within and in close proximity to the plant (including the large stripping towers); <br> 3)	Abandonment of identified extraction and injection wells, to include removal of all surface and shallow appurtenances and restoration of the disturbed ground in these areas; <br> 4)	Characterization and abandonment of all piping between the extraction and injection wells and the treatment plant; <br> 5)	Reporting/documenting all decontamination, demolition, abandonment, characterization and disposal activities. The plant shall be decommissioned in accordance with Utah Administrative Code R315-8-7 and Module VI.B of the Permit.  The most challenging aspect of this project is the scale of the system with the large capacity of the treatment system equipment, the miles of piping, and the depth of the wells (typically 250-350 ft bgs) all contributing to the difficulty and cost of the work. <br>  <br> b.	SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE in: <br>  <br> 1)	State of Utah well abandonment requirements <br> 2)	Hazardous waste profiling and disposal <br> 3)	Demolition of buildings and large equipment/structures (such as air stripper towers) <br>  <br> 3.	SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS <br> Potential offerors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the described project are invited to provide feedback, and/or questions regarding this project directly to the Contracting Officer, via email to Donna.S.Hammock@usace.army.mil.  All capability responses are due in hard copy only to the US Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, ATTENTION:  Donna S. Hammock, 1325 J. Street, Room 878, Sacramento, CA 95814-2922.

<DESC>The Defense Centers of Excellence (DCOE) for Psychological Health (PH) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has a requirement for non-personal services to provide an Outreach/Transition Support Contract Call Center Program to individuals directly or indirectly affected by psychological health (PH) and traumatic brain injury (TBI).  The Defense Centers of Excellence (DCoE) for PH and TBI seek Contractor support to establish and maintain a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (24/7) Outreach/Transition Support Contact Call Center Program that provides a toll-free number for a broad range of users, including Service Members and Veterans and their families, caregivers, military leaders, clinicians, employers, researchers, educators, and community members at both CONUS and OCONUS locations.  Additionally, the DCoE Outreach/Transition Support Contact Call Center Program will be staffed by professionals who are trained, certified, and licensed in varying careers that support the mental healthcare profession, i.e. social workers, etc., to bridge the transitional knowledge gap between identification and receipt of Mental Health Services.  These professionals will not be required to provide direct hands-on medical care or indirect care to DOD Beneficiaries nor will these professionals be required or responsible for making call eligibility determination.  Membership or eligibility determination will not be a requirement or function of the contract.  Contractor support will also involve maintaining and periodically updating the DCoE Resource Database.   <br> The Outreach/Transition Support Contact Call Center Support Program will provide a call triage service to answer and direct calls to the appropriate specialty area, when needed.  The Outreach/Transition Support Contact Call Center staff will handle various types of calls, including routine requests for information about PH and TBI, questions about symptoms a caller is having, and helping a caller find appropriate health care resources.  Thus, the Outreach/Transition Call Center Program will be a source of information, education, transitional coaching and communication on PH and TBI issues to include referrals to the inTransition Program.  <br> The inTransition program assigns service members a support coach, to provide a bridge of individual support between health care systems and providers through coaching services by phone worldwide. The inTransition coach neither performs case management nor delivers PH care. Instead, the inTransition support and coaching services serve as an additional resource for service members to those provided by health care providers and case managers. It will also provide coaching support services needed to bridge potential knowledge gaps in mental health support during transitional periods that can lead to service members' disengagement from treatment entirely by offering information, providing military service members' non-medical counseling, education and advice services for eligible beneficiaries and otherwise encouraging the utilization of behavioral health services.   <br> The DCoE Resource Database will contain relevant and current health, support, and program resource information that is accessible to the Outreach/Transition Consultants as well as to Service Members and Veterans and their families, caregivers, military leaders, clinicians, employers, researchers, educators, and community members. Inclusion of DCoE's Resource Database into a pre-existing resource database will be considered, if there is value added for DCoE.  The current DCoE Resource Database is a web-based repository/database of publications, links to publications, program and website directory listings, and other resources on PH & TBI, supported by a robust search engine. <br> DCoE Outreach Support, program management support services. The scope of this effort encompasses all resources, processes, materials, equipment, and technology to support the communication of best practices to Military Health System Leaders, healthcare providers, service members and their families and communities, and other stakeholders <br> Background: <br>  <br>  <br> The Defense Centers of Excellence (DCoE) for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury undertakes the mission to maximize opportunities for Service Members (active and reserve components), Veterans, and their families to thrive through a collaborative global network promoting resilience, recovery, and reintegration for Psychological Health (PH) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The DCoE accomplishes this through four primary initiatives: <br> Information Clearinghouse. The DCoE serves as the central source where any warrior, family member, caregiver, clinician, researcher, educator, military leader, media specialist, or other interested party may obtain current information regarding PH and TBI. The knowledge and information managed spans a wide spectrum, in depth and breadth, which is relevant to consumers and producers of scientific data and relevant to the layperson, across various PH and TBI issues. <br> Outreach. As a premiere resource on PH and TBI issues, the DCoE plays a very active role in strategically disseminating information of relevance to multiple target audiences, and actively engages with warriors, warrior families, caregivers, clinicians, researchers, leaders, educators, support organizations, and treatment resources to connect, share, collaborate, and coordinate to serve the needs of our warrior families. <br> Advocacy. The DCoE engages network resources to proactively identify concerns regarding the receipt, delivery, and navigation of care for our wounded warriors, as well as to assist in the identification and mobilization of those resources that best address those concerns. <br> Real Warriors Campaign. The DCoE, in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) Mental Health Task Force recommendations, launched a multi-year, national public awareness campaign designed to impact beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors among warriors/families/leaders, about seeking care for PH and TBI issues. The toll-free number of the DCoE Call Center Program is the primary contact vehicle to learning more about PH and TBI issues, transitional coaching, inquiring about how and where to obtain care, asking questions about how to overcome stigma, and understanding how to assist a fellow citizen in need of support/care. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The DCOE is looking for firms that have the capability to provide the necessary services as described above. <br> Responses should be submitted via email and should be sent to mark.w.clinger.civ@mail.mil not later than 5:00 PM, EST, Monday, 12 January 2015.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of Stryker Neurovascular TransForm Occlusion Balloon Catheters. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113: Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. Business size standard for NAICS 339113 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Stryker Corporation, 47900 Bayside Pkwy Fremont, CA, 94538-6515. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Wednesday, 17 Dec 2014, 1200 EST. <br />Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires Stryker Corporation to provide Stryker Neurovascular TransForm Occlusion Balloon Catheters because they are the only known source that distributes and sells this product. The government requires Stryker Neurovascular TransForm Occlusion Balloon Catheters for a Cerebral Angiogram surgery to be performed at the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) at Wright-Patterson AFB. The Stryker Neurovascular TransForm Occlusion Balloon Catheters are a part of the only known system that the Neuro Surgeon is trained on for this type of procedure. The Neuro surgeon has trained using these Stryker implants and systems and if these items are not used the surgery would need to be sent off base at a substantial duplication of cost. Below are the specifications that are required and met by the Stryker Neurovascular TransForm Occlusion Balloon Catheters.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to daniel.bresnahan.1@us.af.mil no later than Wednesday, 17 Dec 2014, 1200 EST. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>

<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate, Kirtland AFB, NM may have a need for contracted effort to ensure unique electro-optical research activities (started under the Innovative Research and Optical Site Support (IROSS) contract) are at an appropriate state to efficiently transition to the successor R&amp;D for Advanced Space Superiority Technology and Engineering Requirements (RASTER) contract. This effort will only be as needed to ensure the successful execution of the AFRL/RDS mission during the transition from the current IROSS contract to RASTER. A six month base period with potential for up to four additional periods, in four month increments, is envisioned.</p>
<p>AFRL/RDS is responsible for the development of adaptive optics (AO), active and passive tracking of air and space targets, space surveillance, and space situational awareness technologies in support of advancing the nation's space superiority capabilities. The contemplated contracted effort, entitled the Advanced Electro-Optical Research for Space Superiority (AEORSS) contract, will provide for the orderly transition from IROSS to RASTER without any impact to on-going AFRL/RDS efforts. AEORSS will provide all the personnel, hardware, software, equipment, and supplies required to perform efforts currently under the IROSS (contract #FA9451-05-C-0257), during this transition period and also provide for contract phase-out.

<DESC>This Notice of Intent is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes; however, in accordance with FAR Part 13 and Part 6.302-1, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to award a sole source purchase order based on the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) states this authority shall be used, "When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by -- (i) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities...". FEMA intends to award this purchase order to Atlantic Door Control of Columbia, MD for the purchase and installation of a Boon Edam TAP 50 Secure Half Entry Portal, which is considered a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 2. This action is being performed in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) which states, "For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available". A "Sole Source Justification for Simplified Acquisition" submitted by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and approved by the Contracting Officer is provided as an attachment to this notice.
<p>DHS, FEMA, Mt. Weather Emergency Operations Center (MWEOC) has a need to create an anti-piggybacking solution for an existing entryway while still maintaining ADA access compliance through the hallway. The purchase and installation of a Boon Edam TAP 50 Secure Half Entry Portal was determined to be the most efficient and economical structure for solving this problem. The TAP 50 is a fully programmable half cylinder portal that can be placed over an existing door to convert it into a high security entrance which will eliminate tailgating and piggybacking. FEMA's Program Office performed extensive research for a solution to convert the existing doorway into a high security entrance and maintain ADA access compliance through the hallway to the office spaces beyond. The existing hallway is 81 inches wide and the Boon Edam TAP 50 portal is 35 inches deep which, after installation, will maintain 46 inches for the passageway to office spaces. Thus, the Boon Edam TAP 50 Secure Half Entry Portal was found to be the only product capable of meeting the existing space limitations, as well as creating the desired anti-piggybacking solution. According to Boon Edam's Mid-Atlantic Business Development Manager, this TAP 50 portal must be purchased through their regional Distribution Channel Partner, Atlantic Door Control located in Columbia, MD. Atlantic Door Control is also Boon Edam's factory authorized installer. FEMA is unaware of any other US company capable of providing a comparable product. However, any company capable of providing an equivalent product may submit descriptive literature, specification sheets, etc., in order to allow the Government to perform an evaluation of your proposed product. This information should be emailed to Phyllis.Woodward@fema.dhs.gov , or faxed to 540-542-2631, no later than 12:00 PM Eastern on January 7, 2015. Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>Competition is not feasible since CenturyLink, as the current multi-strand fiber cable and facility owner, has complete control and access to the single fiber strand leased by the Government. Since procurement of the IRU in 1999, the Government has provided equipment and due to technology advances, this equipment becomes obsolete from time to time and, therefore, requires replacement in order to meet DOD communication mission needs. The location of the equipment is within CenturyLink-owned facilities; thus, there is only one source able to perform this effort and provide essential services to the Government. Using other fiber providers would require access into CenturyLink's facilities or would cause additional cost to the Government for a new fiber network. Additionally, transitioning to another contractor's network would require up to a year to complete and would not meet the mission in the time required. CenturyLink has the experience, resources, technical expertise, and security qualifications required to complete the work at the lowest cost to the Government and in the timeframe required.<br />(16) Description<br />The U.S. Government has a mission critical telecommunications Network Enhancement requirement described herein to upgrade the existing Information System Network (DISN) CORE 10G Corestream optical transport networks to 100G 6500 Packet - Over Transport Network (P-OTN) for the enhancement of all current amplifiers, regenerators, and other equipment on Government Indefeasible Right of Use (IRU) fibers between the following CONUS locations: Kelly AFB, TX, Bacon Ridge, TX, Kirtland AFB, NM, FT.

<a href="mailto:lanell.a.roberts@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for the procurement SEAFLEX dock anchoring System for a new boathouse dock for Mobile District Project Allatoona Lake, GA.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source to provide the SEAFLEX dock anchoring System, under authority of FAR 6.302.  At the current time there is no other anchor system that can provide the same type of functionality to best fit the requirements for Allatoona Lake.  The Seaflex Anchor System is designed for extreme fluctuation in water levels. Allatoona Lake water levels fluctuate as much as 30 feet from the winter months to the summer months.  At the present time, each time the water level rises or falls five feet,   heavy equipment and manpower must be utilized to lower or raise the walkway to a different elevation because of the depth of water under the existing boathouse.  This ongoing problem and safety hazard will be avoided with use of the Seaflex Anchor System for the new boathouse.  The Seaflex Anchor System will hold the boathouse in place and allow it to move up and down in one location. This anchor system will eliminate the need to move the boathouse with manual labor or equipment.    Therefore, it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to utilize the SEAFLEX dock anchoring system for the new Allatoona Lake Boathouse and Dock.  <br>  <br> It is anticipated that a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract will be awarded. The (NAICS) code is 236220 and the estimated dollar amount is $65K for the SEAFLEX dock anchoring system.  <br>  <br> Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within fifteen calendar days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Responses shall be submitted to LaNell.A.Roberts@usace.army.mil. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: U.S. Army Engineer District, Mobile, P.O.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Bogota, Colombia<br />9.	JOB DESCRIPTION:  See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:</p>
<p>The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Western<br />Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP), is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State.  The Colombia program builds on efforts begun under Plan Colombia, with a shift towards supporting the Colombian government's institutional reforms and strengthening the Rule of Law.  The International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Section (INL) in the Embassy in Bogota Manages the justice sector program funded through the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account and destined for Colombia.</p>
<p>INCLE-funded assistance to Colombia's justice sector began in FY 2000.  This activity complements the Colombian government's much greater investment in promoting rule of law, providing for citizen security and reforming state institutions to foster greater transparency, responsiveness, and respect for human rights.  It also complements activities funded by USAID's Economic Support Funds in the areas of security, rule of law, and community development.  The goal of this program is to institutionalize justice sector reforms to sustain the rule of law and respect for human rights through projects with security and justice sector organizations.</p>
<p>In 2004, Colombia passed the revised Code of Criminal Procedure (Law 906/2004) implementing an oral accusatory criminal justice system.  Colombia's implementation of its criminal justice system remains uneven and plagued by inefficiencies and congestion.  The prospect of a potential peace agreement between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) provides a potentially important window of opportunity for further reform of the criminal justice system, particularly by making the system more accountable and transparent, thereby improving its public image for fairness and effectiveness.  As the Government of Colombia prepares to implement a peace agreement, it must marshal sufficient resources to extend effective justice services to former conflict areas.  While the main emphasis of INL's Rule of Law programs has been on solidifying Colombia's transition to an oral/adversarial criminal justice system, it will be important for those programs to address weaknesses in justice sector administration and institutional capabilities in a post-conflict environment.</p>
<p>Rule of law assistance is a core component of the USG contribution to stability and reconstruction operations worldwide.

<p>The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 29 December 2014, 10:00AM, Pacific Standard Time will be considered by the Government.

<p>The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contract or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contract listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quotes. The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance. The assessment of the quoter's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ. The Government will give greater consideration to the contract that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE - The above contact information is for the Contracting Office and not the delivery address. The delivery address is indicated in the FOB Destination section below.</p>
<p>For information regarding this solicitation, please contact Howard Nesmith by e-Mail at howard.nesmith@fda.hhs.gov.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), is soliciting quotes for buffer and chip reagents to use with BioRad ProteOn Surface Plasmon Resonance Protein Interaction Kinetics System.</p>
<p>Background<br />The FDA/CBER uses a Bio-Rad ProteOn XPR36 Protein Interaction Array System for development of new Vaccine Potency Assays. The ProteOn XPR36 Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) system uses chip sensor surfaces for efficient capture of protein ligands and detection of label free interactions. Full kinetics (on rates, off rates, and affinity/equilibrium constants) of 6 concentrations on 1 to 6 different protein or DNA targets can be accomplished in "One Shot" in about 90 min or less (36 interactions). However with regeneration of immobilized targets, it is possible that this process can be repeated yielding analysis of 40-50 small molecules vs 1- 6 targets, or 6 concentrations of 1 antigen vs 300 ligands/antibodies in about 12-14 hrs. The 6 channel parallel processing also allows different experimental conditions to be run simultaneously in parallel, saving a great deal of time for even the low throughput situations. It will help to determine the real-time kinetics for understanding the affinity of protein-protein or receptor-ligand interactions.</p>
<p>Statement of Need and Minimum Requirements:<br />The ProteOn system requires reagents that are specific for this instrument and are specifically made for use on this system. Specific sensor chips (HTG for His tagged proteins; GLC for amine coupling of proteins; NLC for biotinylated proteins) are required to run the samples on this system for continued productivity for a new research program on Pandemic and seasonal Influenza. In addition:</p>
<p>&bull; Shall be able to analyze up to 36 protein interactions simultaneously in a typical interaction cycle (association and dissociation).This can be up to 6 dilutions on up to 6 proteins in one run without the need for surface regeneration.</p>
<p>&bull; Shall be able to have options for interspot (close proximity) referencing, Channel Referencing, and real time double referencing to ensure high quality removal of sample non-specific binding and sample buffer disturbances.</p>
<p>&bull; Shall be able to analyze up to 6 dilutions on up to 6 proteins in one run without the need for regenerations</p>
<p>&bull; Shall have reusable surfaces that can be regenerated multiple times 10-100 or more, dependent on the lability of the proteins used.</p>
<p>&bull; Molecular weight detection should be at least 100 Da</p>
<p>&bull; Buffers and other non-chip reagents shall be in compliance with optimal ProteOn XPR36 instrument performance.</p>
<p>&bull; Shall not void manufacturer warranty or prohibit future service agreements.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT<br />INTENT TO ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT-UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIP(S)<br />IN RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS<br />FOR THE NAVAL AIR WARFARE CENTER AIRCRAFT DIVISION<br />N00421-15-R-0020</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Airworthiness department is soliciting white papers from universities, colleges, and educational research institutes to pursue agreements to research revolutionary capabilities for US Naval forces to mature and transition advances in Airworthiness Assessment tools. This is to improve US Naval capabilities, respond to current critical needs, and maintain broad technology investments to anticipate and counter potential technology surprises. To support this mission, the white paper must provide Airworthiness Assessment solutions and potential tools that will enable the future force while simultaneously seizing opportunities to enhance current readiness. White papers must also discuss the potential commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market.</p>
<p>These efforts will be conducted primarily at the agreement holder's site but NAVAIR facilities may also be available and/or used depending on project needs. Access and use of NAVAIR facilities will require security clearances and US citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>2. BACKGROUND<br /></strong>Innovation fuels economic growth, the creation of new industries, companies, jobs, products and services, and the global competitiveness of U.S. industries.&nbsp; One driver of successful innovation is technology transfer, in which the private sector adapts Federal research for use in the marketplace. <br />The purpose of this broad agency announcement is to advance basic and applied research in support of Naval Aviation. By establishing these collaborative agreements the overall ability to conduct research needed to solve current and future technological challenges pertinent to Navy Airworthiness will be addressed. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) is interested in technologies and proposals, which will demonstrate potential improvements in Airworthiness assessments.&nbsp; The demonstrations and research shall be in direct support of the Navy's Airworthiness Division. Airworthiness is the property of an air system configuration to safely attain, sustain and terminate ('complete' in case of UAS) flight in accordance with approved usage limits. The issuance of a Navy Flight Clearance is contingent upon having the major tenets of airworthiness satisfied and ensures air vehicles and capabilities can be operated safely within defined operating limits.</p>
<p><strong>3. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST</strong><br />The research to be performed shall be directed towards the discovery of new approaches that promise to streamline the airworthiness process for augmenting the capabilities of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and its Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD). Activities shall include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>* Conducting research in current and emerging future technologies.<br />* Teaming with academia and DOD agencies to find the most appropriate solution to current and future war fighter requirements. <br />* Promoting technology transfer using NAVAIR facilities including assessment tools<br />* Providing technical assistance and training associated with assessment tools.<br />* Conduct select airworthiness studies, to develop new tools for airworthiness assessment, and to conduct basic and applied research of new approaches that promise to streamline the airworthiness process for augmenting the capabilities of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and its Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD). These studies shall specifically address the&nbsp; NAVAIR Areas of Interest as they pertain to airworthiness:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Systems Engineering (Systems Engineering Technical Review (SETR) Process, Independent Engineering, Airworthiness planning tools such as Airworthiness Qualification Plan (AQP), Engineering Data Requirements Agreement Plan (EDRAP), Data Element List (DEL); <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Safety Management and Technical Risk Assessment Systems, Continuing Airworthiness (Configuration Management, Maintenance, Material Management); <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Airworthiness Certifications (Interim and Permanent Flight Clearances); <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Training and Training Devices; Flight Test Peculiar (Aircraft Operating Limits, Continuation Criteria, Envelope Expansion Plan, Air System Maturity)</p>
<p><strong>4. AGREEMENT TYPE<br /></strong>NAWCAD is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including but not limited to traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts or other non-procurement agreements.&nbsp; The Government will make the final decision on the acquisition type.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Modifications to the agreements may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting agreement.</p>
<p><strong>5. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION</strong><br />Proposal submissions shall follow a two phased approach. The first phase will consist of submission of a technical white paper, discussed below. Phase II, submission of full proposals, is by invitation only. No further Request for Information (RFI), solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.

In accordance with FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i) NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Philadelphia Office intends to solicit only one source, CISCO (and its authorized resellers).

The delivery is anticipated to be 30 days After Date of Contract (ADC). Only authorized resellers of CISCO may submit quotations to fulfill this requirement which shall be considered by the NAVSUP FLC Norfolk, Philadelphia Office. This procurement is a small business set-aside. The NACIS is 423430 COMPUTER AND COMPUTER PERIPHERAL EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE MERCHANT WHOLESALERS  Size Standard is 500 employees.

STATEMENT OF WORK
1.	Services shall be furnished to beneficiaries for whom such care is specifically authorized by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  It is understood the type of patients to be cared for under this contract will normally require care and services above the level of room and board.  Care shall include, but not limited to, a supervised alcohol and drug-free environment, active affiliation with Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) programs, supportive Social Services, structured and group activities, physical activities, and individual counseling as required (with special emphasis on vocational rehabilitation in collaboration with VA program resources).  It is further agreed that beneficiaries receiving care under this contract shall receive basic health and personal hygiene maintenance, monitoring of medications, and any other service or supplies normally provided without extra charge.
2.	The per diem contract rate will be a firm fixed price at an all-inclusive rate.

Should a patient referred to a transitional residence absent him/herself in an unauthorized manner, payment for services for that veteran to the contract facility would be continued for a maximum period of two (2) days provided there is an active outreach attempt on the part of the agreed facility staff to return the veteran to the transitional residence and a strong likelihood that the patient will return.

<DESC><strong><br />Introduction<br /></strong>The objectives of the DoD SBIR Program include stimulating technological innovation in DoD's Science and Technology Emphasis Areas, strengthening the role of small business in meeting DoD research and development needs, fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing the commercial application of DoD-supported research or research and development results.<br /><br /><strong>Three Phase Program</strong><br />The SBIR Program is a three-phase program. <br /><br />Phase I is to determine, to the extent possible, the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR Program. Phase I awards are typically $70,000 to $150,000 in size, and the period of performance is generally from six to twelve months. Proposals should concentrate on research or research and development which will significantly contribute to proving the scientific and technical feasibility, and commercialization potential of the proposed effort, the successful completion of which is a prerequisite for further DoD support in Phase II. Proposers are encouraged to consider whether the research or research and development being proposed to DoD Components also has private sector potential, either for the proposed application or as a base for other applications.
<p>Phase II awards will be made to firms on the basis of results of their Phase I effort and the scientific merit, technical merit, and commercialization potential of the Phase II proposal. Phase II awards are typically $500,000 to $1,000,000 in size and the period of performance is generally 24 months. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. A Phase II contractor may receive up to one additional, sequential Phase II award for continued work on the project.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>The objectives of the DoD SBIR Program include stimulating technological innovation in DoD's Science and Technology Emphasis Areas, strengthening the role of small business in meeting DoD research and development needs, fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing the commercial application of DoD-supported research or research and development results.<br /><br /><strong>Three Phase Program</strong><br />The SBIR Program is a three-phase program.
<p>Phase I is to determine, to the extent possible, the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR Program. Phase I awards are typically $70,000 to $150,000 in size, and the period of performance is generally from six to twelve months. Proposals should concentrate on research or research and development which will significantly contribute to proving the scientific and technical feasibility, and commercialization potential of the proposed effort, the successful completion of which is a prerequisite for further DoD support in Phase II. Proposers are encouraged to consider whether the research or research and development being proposed to DoD Components also has private sector potential, either for the proposed application or as a base for other applications.</p>
<p>Phase II awards will be made to firms on the basis of results of their Phase I effort and the scientific merit, technical merit, and commercialization potential of the Phase II proposal. Phase II awards are typically $500,000 to $1,000,000 in size and the period of performance is generally 24 months. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. A Phase II contractor may receive up to one additional, sequential Phase II award for continued work on the project.</p>
<p>Under Phase III, the Proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military or private sector markets. SBIR Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.
As prescribed in 1346.503, insert the following clause: Place of Acceptance (APR 2010) (a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract. (b) The place of acceptance will be:NOAA SHIP PISCES GULF MARINE SUPPORT FACILITY 151 WATTS AVENUE PASCAGOULA, MS 39567 <BR> <BR>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Syria program supports the larger objectives of the U.S. Government to promote stability and democracy in Syria by providing assistance to moderate governing bodies and civil actors working to preserve the original moderate ideals of the revolution and lay the foundation for inclusive governance. In close coordination with the State Department representatives and other U.S. Government actors, and with consideration of U.S. Government priorities, OTI's rapid and targeted programs will address emerging issues and empower local partners potentially to include non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, media outlets, and local and national government offices to reduce or mitigate the effects of the conflict, promote norms of tolerance, and foster positive political change.<br /> <br />The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Middle East Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Country Representative in the country of assignment. The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility will be the development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Syria program.

The candidate should be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, U.S. Government agencies, and clerics or other religious leaders.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

re-Solicitation Notice:<br /><br />DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />As part of the flooding protection at Nuclear Power Plants arising from design basis floods, penetrations in walls at the NPP that allow such items as cables, conduits, cable trays, pipes, and ducts to pass through the walls should be essentially water tight to preclude water from flowing through them and affecting the performance of safety related components in the NPP. Flood seals for penetrations (FSP) are installed to seal these openings to ensure water tightness and integrity of the wall penetrations. Currently there are no known standard test methods or acceptance criteria for FSP's and their effectiveness to water pressure heads when subject to degradation due to drying and cracking, immersion under water for long periods, flooding events, vibrations from items such as piping passing through them, hydrodynamic forces and impacts by debris during flooding events, etc. Thus, there is a need to establish testing standards, criteria and protocols to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of these seals.<br />As a result of the Fukushima nuclear incident, the NRC has issued a Request for Information pursuant to 10 CFR 50.54 (f) requiring all operating nuclear power plants in the U.S. to re-evaluate their design-basis flood estimates. As part of the flooding protection at Nuclear Power Plants (NPP), penetrations in external (and internal) walls at the NPP that allow such items as cables, conduits, cable trays, pipes, and ducts to pass through the walls should be water tight to preclude water from flowing through them and affecting the performance of safety related components in the NPP
<p>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform the project, "Flood Penetration Seal Performance at Nuclear Power Plants."</p>

The government anticipates a contract period of performance of January 13, 2015 to January 12, 2018.</p>
<p>The Solicitation/Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued utilizing FAR Part 15, source selection: best value/tradeoff process. The government anticipates release of the solicitation on or about October 29, 2014, with a projected closing date of December 2, 2014. These are projected dates and are subject to change.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Notice of Contract Action (NOCA)<br />Dynamic Retasking Capability (DRC) Operations Support (OS)</p>
<p>The Theater Battle Control Division (HBD), Battle Space Communication Branch (HBDC), Battle Management (BM) Directorate, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Hanscom AFB, MA anticipates awarding a contract modification to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NG) to extend DRC contract FA8307-14-C-0024 for twelve (12) months with a six (6) month option in order to provide continued Operational Support to the Dynamic Retasking Capability (DRC) Program system. The DRC system provides support to USAF Military Airlift Forces (MAF) aircraft both in CONUS and OCONUS locations. The contractor will provide maintenance and mission support for aircraft equipped with the DRC system which provides a Roll on / Roll off (RORO) Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) capability to MAF aircraft. <br />The DRC system is a set of radios, cockpit displays, central processor and interface software that allows MAF aircraft to become part of the tactical data network. The system allows the aircraft and aircrew to interface with a local tactical data network while simultaneously extending that network to a BLOS location. Aircrews, during the performance of restocking combat troops, are apprised of enemy threats as they are detected, and options are pushed directly to the cockpit. Flights are dynamically adjusted based on the information transmitted thus enhancing force protection levels. Northrop Grumman is the originator of the DRC system. <br />This NOCA does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach; the Government will not reimburse firms for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.<br />Questions concerning this requirement may be directed by email to Walter Wysocki by email at Walter.Wysocki@hanscom.af.mil or to the procurement purchasing officer, Kelly Martineau by email at <a href="mailto:Kelly.Martineau@hanscom.af.mil">Kelly.Martineau@hanscom.af.mil</a>.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>The purpose of this modification is to revise the "Response Date" field of the Pre-Solicitation announcement to be revised from December 29, 2014 3:00 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">am</span> Eastern to December 29, 2014 3:00 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pm</span> Eastern.</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases. The Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic is growing worldwide at an alarming rate and has disproportionately affected the health, economic development and political stability of many of the world's poorest and most vulnerable populations. To combat this global threat and to prevent the spread of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection, the NIAID supports biomedical research to increase the basic knowledge of the pathogenesis, natural history and transmission of HIV disease, and to evaluate new and improved approaches for the detection, treatment and prevention of HIV infection and its complications.</p>
<p>NIAID accomplishes this through planning, implementing, managing and evaluating programs in the following: (1) fundamental basic research; (2) discovery and development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications; and (3) discovery and development of vaccines and other prevention strategies. The significant majority of these activities are housed in NIAID's Division of AIDS (DAIDS) with limited support provided to other organizational components of NIAID. The NIAID HIV/AIDS programs must be built with flexibility and coordinate across NIAID with other organizations, in order to permit rapid, efficient and scalable responses to emerging scientific and clinical opportunities.</p>
<p>A signification portion of the work carried out by DAIDS is the oversight of the design, implementation, conduct and oversight of clinical trials and clinical studies supported through grants, contracts and interagency agreements. This includes NIAID-sponsored Phase I, II, III, IV and post-marketing trials of HIV therapeutic, vaccine and prevention clinical research. NIAID currently supports clinical research efforts through large clinical networks, individual single or multi-site grants, and partnerships with other Federal and non-Federal agencies. NIAID is currently supporting approximately 400 trials related to HIV and AIDS in various stages. These trials range from 10 to 6,000 participants and are conducted in more than 40 countries. Approximately half of the countries are resource poor.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span></strong></p>
<p>The Division of AIDS currently supports a contract for NIAID HIV/AIDS Scientific and Operations Support" under contract number HHSN272200800014C with Henry M. Jackson Foundation (HJF). The purpose of the contract is to provide scientific, technical and operational expertise for NIAID HIV and AIDS research, and particularly clinical research activities that are conducted as part of grant and contract awards. The scope of activities include: (1) Clinical Research Support; (2) Program Operations Support; (3) Communications Support; (4) Conflict of Interest Mitigation, Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Plan; (5) Project Management; and (6) Final Transition. The Contractor provides critical support in areas such as laboratory monitoring, assay development, scientific and medical expertise, clinical site training, clinical trial planning and evaluation, clinical trial pharmacy support and oversight, clinical site monitoring, support for clinical trials' Data Safety and Monitoring Boards (DSMBs), clinical trial safety reporting of Adverse Events to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), etc.</p>
<p>The purpose of this follow-on extension is to continue to provide scientific, technical and operational expertise for NIAID DAIDS HIV and AIDS research and particularly clinical research activities that are conducted as part of grant and contract awards. The scope of activities included in the extension related to this notice are only those functions of the original contract that are deemed as critical/essential.</p>
<p>The NIAID intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1, on a sole source basis, with HJF to extend the existing contract period of performance for a six month period from March 1, 2015 through August 31, 2015, and to include an option to Extend Services to allow extension of the contract for an additional 6 month period from September 1, 2015 through February 29, 2016. No other source is able to provide these critical/essential services beginning on March 1, 2015 without causing unacceptable delays to the Government in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement. All capability statements received within fifteen days from the date of the publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously advertised under a Research and Development Sources Sought Notice that was posted in the Federal Business Opportunities on November 12, 2014 as notice number HHS-NIH-NIAID-RDSS-15-NIHAI2015130.</p>

<a href="mailto:lanell.a.roberts@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for the procurement SEAFLEX dock anchoring System for a new boathouse dock for Mobile District Project Allatoona Lake, Georgia.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source to provide the SEAFLEX dock anchoring System, under authority of FAR 6.302.  At the current time there is no other anchor system that can provide the same type of functionality to best fit the requirements for Allatoona Lake.  The Seaflex Anchor System is designed for extreme fluctuation in water levels. Allatoona Lake water levels fluctuate as much as 30 feet from the winter months to the summer months.  At the present time, each time the water level rises or falls five feet,   heavy equipment and manpower must be utilized to lower or raise the walkway to a different elevation because of the depth of water under the existing boathouse.  This ongoing problem and safety hazard will be avoided with use of the Seaflex Anchor System for the new boathouse.  The Seaflex Anchor System will hold the boathouse in place and allow it to move up and down in one location. This anchor system will eliminate the need to move the boathouse with manual labor or equipment.    Therefore, it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to utilize the SEAFLEX dock anchoring system for the new Allatoona Lake Boathouse and Dock.   <br>    <br>  It is anticipated that a Firm-Fixed-Price Contract will be awarded. The (NAICS) code is 236220 and the estimated dollar amount is $65K for the SEAFLEX dock anchoring system.   <br>    <br>  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within fifteen calendar days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Responses shall be submitted to LaNell.A.Roberts@usace.army.mil. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  <br>  <br> Response Date:  January 2, 2015 at 5:00PM Local Time <br>    <br>  Contracting Office Address: U.S. Army Engineer District, Mobile, P.O. Box 2288, 109 Saint Joseph Street (zip 36602), Mobile, AL 36628-0001.  <br>  Point of Contact: LaNell Roberts     <br>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
659-15-15-1-027-0004	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$37,358.16
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

1.	Maintenance preventive, diagnosis, and non-warranty repairs on the hospital owned INFO VAC Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy System.
2.	Trouble shooting and reasonable after-hours service.
3.	Ongoing and updated in-services on an as needed basis.
4.	Setup, patient placements and rounds to maintain the best results during the use of the hospital owned specialty support surfaces and administrative and placement work.
5.	Cleaning, disinfecting, QC and washing of the product per manufacturers guidelines.


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

VAMC Salisbury has seven purchased KCI INFO VACs on-station that require an extended service plan to ensure operational use. Treatment Systems, INC.(DBA Medical Treatment Systems (MTS) (a small business)) is the sole provider of KCI VAC post purchase service agreements in the central North Carolina area and authorized open market dealer for KCI products. 


4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  

The manufacture (KCI) has provided a letter that states MTS is the sole provider for asset management of KCI technologies in the Salisbury area.

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
8.	Market research was conducted through the web and Government Databases that lead to the conclusion to sole source this requirement.
