<DESC>Global Transportation Network Downselect: United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) provides global air, land, and sea transportation for the Department of Defense (DOD), both in time of peace and in time of war through its Transportation Component Commands (TCCs): Air Mobility Command (AMC), Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC), and Military Sealift Command (MSC). Global Transportation Network (GTN) is a command and control (C2) information system that integrates transportation information that supports Commander In Chief Transportation (CINCTRANS) C2 mission requirement for planning, directing, and controlling operations of assigned forces pursuant to global transportation management. GTN provides aggregated information so that the National Command Authority (NCA), Commanders In Chief (CINCs), USTRANSCOM (to include its component commands), and other transportation information customers can plan, have visibility of, make decisions on, and execute the transportation mission. GTN was developed to overcome the lack of command, control, communication, and computer (C4) system capabilities to allow USTRANSCOM to act in its capacity of single manager for global common-user air, land, and sea transportation and thereby achieve its primary mission.
