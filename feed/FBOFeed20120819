<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:  Westboro Photonics Type C Goniometer
<SOLNBR>NB685030-12-04610
<RESPDATE>090212
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Westboro Photonics, of Ottowa, Canada, for a Type C Goniometer.
<p>*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --<br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or<br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)</p>
<p>NIST currently utilizes an existing Westboro Photonics CCD-array spectroradiometer, which is used for optical measurement in the Sensor Science Division's Lighting and Color Group. NIST has a research need to expand the current Westboro Photonics spectroradiometer system into a gonio-spectroradiometer system through the integration of a Type C Goniometer into the current spectroradiometer system. The addition of the Type C Goniometer will allow for angular scanning.</p>
<p>Westboro Photonics is the only responsible source for the required Type C goniometer, as it is the only goniometer in the marketplace that is 100% compatible, in terms of both hardware and software, with the existing Westboro Photonics spectroradiometer system.</p>
<p>Purchasing a goniometer from another source would require extensive modifications to the existing spectroradiometer system, which would cause an unacceptable delay in the ultimate deployment of the gonio-spectroradiometer system. The development of new software, or integration of a new software system to existing software programs, would also cause delays as well as significant man-hours and expense. The costs of modifications and integration of another vendor's goniometer, if possible, and the costs of developing or integrating new software is not expected to be recouped through competition.</p>
<p>Westboro Photonics is the only vendor for the required Type C Goniometer, and no other suppliers can satisfy NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern) on September 2, 2012. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate with the Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), located at 5335 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 600, Washington, DC, 20015, on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 6.302-1. These authorities provide an exception to the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />The vast majority of the agency's Local Area Network environment is a Windows Production Environment (WPE), consisting of desktop computers and servers that operate on MSFT operating systems and productivity software products. The agency tests all hardware and software purchased in the agency's technical laboratory prior to release into the WPE. The technical laboratory's purpose is to test and confirm compatibility with Government proprietary and other software by simulating current workload requirements. As part of this testing, the agency relies on contractor support to help design the laboratory; test products; assist in deployment; and modify proprietary MSFT Windows source code to ensure compatibility within the agency's network.<br /><br />The agency intends to acquire on-site MSFT support services. The primary purpose of these support services is to provide the agency with direct access to MSFT developers and source code, as well as access to internal MSFT business plans. Specifically, the agency requires the contractor: <br /><br />&bull; Assist the agency with matching technology to business functions;<br />&bull; Provide the knowledge transfer of MSFT products so the agency can independently work with MSFT products, tools, and technologies;<br />&bull; Provide guidance and support on designing, planning, migration, tuning, and optimizing MSFT products, tools, and technologies;<br />&bull; Diagnose and resolve operating system software defects and limitations; and<br />&bull; Provide guidance for operating system software to address the agency's evolving application requirements.<br /><br />The agency's ongoing efforts to successfully adopt new information technology require these support services. The agency recently completed its migration Windows Vista to Windows 7, and MSFT Exchange 2008 to MSFT Exchange 2010, which are currently on going activities.<br /><br />MSFT is the only known responsible source that has access to 1) MSFT proprietary software code; 2) future software releases; 3) confidential MSFT planning documents and business plans. MSFT system engineers are uniquely qualified because they have advanced knowledge of strategic product technology, understanding of their applications, detailed understanding of MSFT systems design specifications, and understanding of MSFT source code. For these reasons, the agency believes MSFT is the only source that can provide the level of support necessary.<br /><br />Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. Verbal responses are not acceptable and the agency will not provide consideration to any responses not in writing. This is a notice of intent and the agency has not issued a solicitation. Therefore, the agency will not respond to requests for solicitation copies and will not pay for information received in response to this announcement. A determination by the agency not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the agency's discretion.<br /><br />The agency will consider information received solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties must submit any response to this notice no later than five business of this announcement. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please notify the point of contact listed below.

<DESC>The VA Health Administration Center (HAC) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI), in accordance with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Administration Center (HAC) laws, regulations, and requirements to determine what types of companies are available to perform the following service:

INTRODUCTION:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Purchased Care at Heath Administration Center (PC@HAC) processes pharmacy transactions for a variety of health benefit programs administered by VA. The programs covered include Civilian Heath and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) 38 CFR, Section 17.270 to 17.278 to include the Caregiver Program, Spina Bifida Health Care (SB) and Children of Women Vietnam Veterans Healthcare (CWVV) programs 38 CFR, Section 17.900 to 17.905. The PC@HAC intends to adjudicate pharmacy health care transactions via Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Compliant Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). The PC@HAC intends to utilize the expertise of a Contractor (Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM)) with an extensive network of retail pharmacies.  The Contractor will be URAC certified.

BACKGROUND:
The PC@HAC administers several health benefit programs.

The PC@HAC currently utilizes an open formulary; with some medication exclusions. 
Many CHAMPVA beneficiaries are Medicare eligible and may opt to purchase a Medicare Part D plan. CHAMPVA is always a secondary payer to Medicare.  Those beneficiaries, who choose to enroll in a Medicare Part D plan, may have their pharmacy bill PC@HAC as a secondary payer through the PBM if the pharmacy is enrolled in the PBM's network of pharmacies. 
The Caregivers program is a separate program established under the "Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010," the program provides a variety of services to include access to CHAMPVA health care insurance for an in-home designated Caregiver who is not already entitled to care of services under a health care plan.  Enrollees and prescription volume data are included in the CHAMPVA totals detailed above.

b.	Spina Bifida Program:

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.

While additional support documentation (e.g. technical specifications, etc.) may be requested, pricing shall be entered in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.
