<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure a technical expert that would work with the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) to develop programs and initiatives involving interdisciplinary collaborative research across the full range of disciplines and stakeholders necessary to fully elucidate the complex determinants of health and health systems challenges.

The period of performance is from the date of award to September 29, 2008 with one option year from September 30, 2008 to September 29, 2009.  The place of performance will include NIH and offsite (including contractor facility).


Background:

OBSSR furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavioral and social factors play in health, health care and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of NIH policies, goals, and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research.  

Based on its Strategic Prospectus, OBSSR?s vision is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve the pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR?s plan includes facilitating: (a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social science research; (b) transdisciplinary ?team science? that integrates biomedical, behavioral and social-ecological perspectives; (c) research that integrates the systems and multiple levels of analysis ? from cells to society ? required to understand and model how individual, group, societal and contextual factors interact; and (d) the translation, implementation, dissemination and maintenance of best practices to strengthen the science of dissemination, put what is known into widespread practice, reduce the burden of chronic disease and help eliminate inequities in health and health care.

Project Objectives:

The objective of this project is to develop an implementation plan for the OBSSR Strategic Prospectus.  Specifically, this contract is intended to procure a technical expert that would work with OBSSR to develop programs and initiatives involving interdisciplinary collaborative research across the full range of disciplines and stakeholders necessary to fully elucidate the complex determinants of health and health systems challenges.  Such collaborations will yield new conceptual frameworks, methods, measures, and technologies that will speed the improvement of population health.

Scope of Work:

Despite the growing enthusiasm for interdisciplinary approaches and recent models of success, broad acceptance of interdisciplinary research remains a goal for the future.  In consultation with the Project Officer, OBSSR?s Director and Staff, the Contractor shall develop programs and initiatives to facilitate an interdisciplinary, team-based approach to population health research by fostering collaborations among the broad base of stakeholders (e.g., policy makers, employers, practitioners, patients, and the general public) needed to ensure the implementation and adoption of scientific findings.

The contractor shall participate in planning and advising on implementation of the key issues and foci of the Strategic Prospectus involving interdisciplinary research. Specifically, the Contractor shall develop a detailed implementation plan in consultation with the Project Officer to achieve each of the following seven key OBSSR goals:

1.	Engage the scientific community through a variety of modalities such as symposia, working groups, and ad hoc committees to identify research areas that can be effectively investigated using interdisciplinary approaches.

2.	Encourage and support the identification of and the development of funding opportunity announcements and Requests for Proposals to address the areas identified for interdisciplinary study.

3.	Provide education and training activities to facilitate interdisciplinary research among biomedical, behavioral, and social science researchers and practitioners.  Strive for appropriate representation of scientific disciplines across the natural sciences (e.g., psychology, biology), mathematics and computer science, social sciences (e.g., anthropology, economics, communications, political science, public health), and applied sciences beyond traditional health-related fields (e.g., business, education, engineering).

4.	Identify, document, and share with key audiences studies that demonstrate the value of integrating social and behavioral science perspectives, constructs, and measures in health research.

5.	Develop metrics and methods needed to demonstrate the economic benefits and public health impacts of rigorous, integrated biopsychosocial health research.

6.	Collaborate in the development of curricula, modules, and materials to train behavioral, social, and biomedical scientists to design and conduct interdisciplinary research.

7.	Strengthen the behavioral and social sciences research methods and analyses to support interdisciplinary biopsychosocial health research.  Increase the degree to which behavioral and social scientists have the capacity to help fulfill the Office?s mandate and the NIH mission.

All objectives should meet the SMART criteria (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timed).

?	Specific ? Be precise about what OBSSR is going to achieve in the area of problem based research. 
?	Measurable ? Quantify the objectives. 
?	Achievable ? Is OBSSR attempting too much? 
?	Realistic ? Does OBSSR have the resources to achieve the objective?
?	Timed ? State when OBSSR will achieve the objective?

The expected tasks to be completed during the period of performance are as follows:

1)	Convene a series of face-to-face meetings with the Project Officer, OBSSR?s Director and Staff members to consider and refine the seven goals listed above
2)	Using the information gathered in task 1, develop an implementation plan based on the prioritized and refined goals with specific objectives and performance indicators of progress and success

Project Objectives:

The objective of this project is to develop an implementation plan for the OBSSR Strategic Prospectus.  Specifically, this contract is intended to procure a technical expert that would work with OBSSR to develop research programs and initiatives in dissemination science and communications.
 
Scope of Work:

In today?s digitally connected environment, an infrastructure for better communications and dissemination represents a key part of OBSSR?s communications strategy.  Improving the nation?s health requires knowledge of behavior change and interactive technologies (e.g., e-health, internet-based interactive technology to change behavior).  Communications is a multi-directional process that links communities of research and practice.  Public health interventions cannot save lives if they are not implemented, and research cannot improve health if it is not informed by the needs and experiences of practitioners.  Building communication channels that link all of the stakeholders of public health into a living, participatory community will form a critical backbone for the way we approach health, disease, and wellness in the future.

The contractor shall participate in planning and advising on implementation of the key issues and foci of the Strategic Prospectus involving the science of dissemination and communication strategies and goals. Specifically, the Contractor shall develop a detailed implementation plan in consultation with the Project Officer to achieve each of the following three key OBSSR strategic goals:

1.	Identifying what is known and where the gaps are in the general public?s understanding of evidence-based behavior, change tools and technology, especially e-health and interactive web, telephone and other electronic media.  

2.	Identifying or creating dissemination channels for sharing social and behavioral science perspectives, constructs, and measures in health research.

3.	Working with other expert consultants, coordinate a workgroup to identify social marketing strategies, understanding of consumer demand and direct to consumer advertising approaches to educating the public about behavioral science tools.  .  

4.	Identifying key audiences and tailoring strategic communications strategies to those audiences to increase awareness of behavioral tools.

5.	Developing a method to gather and identify the best evidence-based practices and policies for behavior change.

6.	Developing plans to improve the health literacy of the public and their ability to identify and use evidence-based behavior change tools.

Further, for each of the specific objectives developed to address the goals listed above, the Contractor shall develop performance measures that may be utilized to assess OBSSR?s performance in achieving these goals and objectives.  

All objectives should meet the SMART criteria (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timed).

?	Specific ? Be precise about what OBSSR is going to achieve in the area of problem based research. 
?	Measurable ? Quantify the objectives. 
?	Achievable ? Is OBSSR attempting too much? 
?	Realistic ? Does OBSSR have the resources to achieve the objective?
?	Timed ? State when OBSSR will achieve the objective?

For each of the specific objectives developed to address the goals listed above, the Contractor shall develop performance measures that may be utilized to assess OBSSR?s performance in achieving these goals and objectives.  

All objectives should meet the SMART criteria (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timed).

?	Specific ? Be precise about what OBSSR is going to achieve in the area of problem based research. 
?	Measurable ? Quantify the objectives.

?	Timed ? State when OBSSR will achieve the objective?

The expected tasks to be completed during the period of performance are as follows:

1)	Convene a series of face-to-face meetings with the Project Officer, OBSSR?s Director and Staff members to consider the ten goals listed above
2)	Using the information gathered in task 1, develop an implementation plan for refining and prioritizing the  above  goals with specific objectives and performance indicators of progress and success

4)	Circulate the draft plan to stakeholders and NIH Behavioral and Social Sciences Coordinating Committee for review and comments
5)	Revise the plan based on the comments received

The Assessment Plan is critical to the ongoing progress and success of the Office?s efforts.  The Contractor shall develop indicators of progress and success.  The contractor shall ensure that ongoing progress assessments will be easy to conduct and supportive of the Office?s efforts. The assessment approach will yield simple reports of progress over time, and indicate where success is indicated.  The progress assessment will serve not only to enable the internal OBSSR group to track progress, but also will point to communications opportunities with Institutes and Centers, external research and program partners, and other key supporters.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 07-08 DARPA Polymer Ice WHITEPAPERS DUE 03/06/2007 FULL PROPOSALS DUE 04/24/2007, TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Mitchell Zakin, DARPA/DSO, Phone: (703) 248-1509, Email: baa07-08-@darpa.mil; URL: www.darpa.mil/dso.


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The unrestricted mobility of enemy forces in the crowded urban battle space, including 
individual combatants and vehicles, severely reduces the effectiveness of military and peacekeeping operations. This, coupled with difficulties in the identification of adversaries amongst the local populace, creates a dangerous, uncertain, high-risk environment that risks coalition and civilian casualties. As such, there is an immediate need for methods to deny enemy transit while simultaneously maintaining our own. An effective solution is found from the basic tenet: to get from Point A to Point B, one must have sufficient traction with the ground.

In response to this challenge, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative proposals to  develop Polymer Ice, a polymer-based artificial ice material that achieves effective mobility control by the precise and 
reversible reduction of ground traction. The Polymer Ice program aims to replicate the properties of black ice, a thin, translucent, slippery coating of ice on roadway surfaces that forms spontaneously in cold temperatures, but for use in a broad range of hot, arid environments such as found in Iraq and Afghanistan. A non-toxic reversal agent, carefully matched to the chemical characteristics of Polymer Ice, will be developed to rapidly restore traction when applied to a Polymer 
Ice-coated surface. Most importantly, incorporation of the reversal agent into combat boots and tires, to achieve instantaneous traction restoration on contact, will provide true asymmetric mobility capabilities to our war fighters. This 
is akin to having the ability to run effortlessly on wet ice, while adversary mobility is simultaneously severely restricted.

It is envisioned that a Mobility Control System would consist of Polymer Ice (or raw materials used to produce Polymer Ice in 
real-time), a spray-on reversal agent, boots/tires with built-in reversal agent, a dispersal means, and a means for clean-up 
of the reversed material. Such a system will provide unprecedented situational control and sustained operational tempo, including the ability to shape the terrain by constraining adversaries to specific areas, control ingress/egress to buildings, degrade the ability of our adversaries to shoot and chase us, and gain time for our war fighters to act rather than react.

PROPOSAL EVALUATION:	Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, in descending order of importance: 

1. SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERIT
2. VALUE TO DEFENSE
3. CAPABILITY OF THE PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES TO PERFORM THE PROPOSED EFFORT
4. COST REALISM AND REASONABLENESS

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:	 Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated PIP available at

CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS (ChemComm) SOL BAA07-11, WHITE PAPERS DUE: 03/13/07; FULL PROPOSALS DUE: 05/01/07
TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Mitchell R. Zakin, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (703) 248-1509, Email: baa07-11@darpa.mil; URL: www.darpa.mil/dso. Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0711

DESCRIPTION

Effective communications are central to all military operations. In specific circumstances, the ability to encode and transmit information in a rapid and covert manner is of extreme importance. Such operations include tagging, tracking, and locating (TTL), identification of friendly forces embedded or trapped in combatant zones, and surveillance and reconnaissance missions. In these cases, it is often advantageous to transmit information over long distances, e.g., to an airplane or UAV, and/or to leave multiple messages behind in strategic locations. Furthermore, the means of communications should be active and self-powered, with passive readout, to ensure broad field-of-view coverage. Day/night operation, long duration, and the ability to broadcast at strategic wavelengths are additional critical features. Temporally modulated optical communications, in which the coded information is transmitted using a pulsed optical light source, in conjunction with an appropriate phase-sensitive detector, can meet these needs. However, transport and dissemination of existing optical transmitters for the stated operations is not logistically practical. There is an immediate need for new, simpler means for achieving effective optical communications in battlespace environments. 

In response to this challenge, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative proposals to develop self-powered chemical systems that can encode an input string of alphanumeric characters (i.e., a message), convert the message to a modulated optical signal, and transmit it repetitively to a receiver. It is desired that the optical signal be in the NIR to SWIR bandpass. The ultimate goal of the Chemical Communications program is to develop a small replicator device, with the form factor of a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or cell-phone, that:

1.	Permits the user to input an arbitrary 60-character alphanumeric message;
2.	Translates the message into an appropriate set of modulated chemistries;
3.	Embeds these chemistries into a disposable substrate (the transmitter); and
4.	Ejects the substrate for deployment.

The replicator device will enable warfighters to generate disposable optical transmitters in real-time, each with a user-specified message. The replicator can be powered by batteries, solar cells, or similar means. It is envisioned that the disposable transmitter could have the weight and form factor ranging from a sheet of paper to a piece of string, possibly with an adhesive backing for deployment on all surfaces. The transmitter will transparently and repetitively broadcast its embedded message, using only on-board chemical power, with a transmission rate for each individual character of at least 10 Hz for a sustained period. A fieldable version is also being envisioned where the transmitter will continuously broadcast for durations exceeding 100 hours. The transmitter can use any chemically-based means to generate the desired message. Chemical Communications will provide the warfighter with revolutionary means for covert strategic communications in complex environments such as the urban battlespace.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Inputs to the Transformational Communications Architecture

General:  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information that will help the National Security Space Office (NSSO) / Communications Functional Integration Office (COMM-FIO) updates of the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA).  The TCA defines an integrated Department of Defense (DOD), Intelligence Community (IC), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) communications architecture to support national level communications.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, DISA is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist DISA in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this RFI.

1.0 Description.  The purpose of this RFI is to incorporate current and future COMSATCOM capabilities into the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA) version 3.  Inputs will be evaluated by a DISA led COMSATCOM working group in support of the NSSO/COMM-FIO.  Opportunities to present inputs or updated information may be arranged at a future point.  Sufficient interest and participation by industry may warrant that materials be discussed in a face-to-face setting or for potential group meetings to reach a consensus on COMSATCOM architecture attributes.

2.0 Background.  The current TCA, version 2, addresses COMSATCOM augmentation to support ongoing and surge bandwidth capacity requirements.  An objective of the planned TCA update will be to address an expanded potential role for COMSATCOM and to leverage emerging commercial satellite capabilities, which would support transformational goals out to the 2020+ timeframe.  The state of the commercial industry will be assessed in several time segments, i.e., near-term (within 5 years from the present), mid-term (10 years out) and far term (2015+).  In order to best accomplish this, DOD requests industry?s assistance through response to this RFI which will constitute commercial industry?s formal opportunity to contribute to an updated TCA.

DOD is soliciting commercial capabilities that can be applied as open architectural solutions to meet specific military needs or opportunities.  These needs and opportunities include but are not limited to:

A.	Mobile Satellite Service
	L-band
	S-band
	Other bands
B.	Fixed Satellite Service
	C-band
	X-band
	Ku-band
	Ka-band
C.	Specific SATCOM applications
	Handheld communications
	Comm-on-the-move (COTM)
	Airborne (aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) communications
	Shipboard communications
	Modem technology
	Antenna technology
	Quality of service applications (QoS)
D. Narrowband netted communications capability augmentation and means to satisfy them (e.g., use of existing service, use of planned service, opportunities for hosted payloads, etc.)
E. Wideband communications capability augmentation and means to satisfy them (e.g., use of existing service, use of planned service, opportunities for hosted payloads, etc.)
F. Existing or innovative opportunities and approaches to assure long term access to COMSATCOM services (e.g., pre-positioned leases, hosted payloads, portable capacity, etc.) that provide flexibility, given the uncertainties of DOD operating areas, durations, or funding availability, etc.
G. Available infrastructure (e.g., terrestrial networks, earth terminals, etc.) capabilities and recommendations on whether such capabilities are best leveraged through use of industry organic infrastructure or DOD-specific infrastructure investment

(These needs and opportunities are not intended to be exhaustive or mutually exclusive.)

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to extend contract  DTFAWA-04-D-00005 with Eyak Technology LLC of Reston, VA, which provides support via a Service Licensing Agreement for Enhanced Status Information System (ESIS) projectors at FAA facilities nationwide. The FAA has commenced the process of a competitive acquisition for the follow-on contract and anticipates contract award by August 1, 2007 (see market survey announcement of June 13, 2006). This action is needed as the competitive follow-on procurement for this contract is not scheduled to be awarded until August 1, 2007, and the current contract expires February 28, 2007. The RFO/SIR for the follow-on contract is projected to be issued in February, 2007. Because of the nature of the support provided under this contract, extension of the current contract plus an estimated increase in the overall contract value of $205,000.00 will be needed pending award of the follow-on contract.  Thus, the current contract would be extended from February 28 to July 31, 2007. If you have any questions or comments regarding this contract action, please contact the Contracting Officer Mr. Tim Eckert no later than close of business  January 22, 2007 at the number specified below.

HQ SACT is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. HQ SACT intends to use the sealed bid procedure involving possible pre-award discussions. Partial bidding is not allowed.

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for this project is ACT-SACT-07-08 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using as its reference IFIB-ACT-SACT-07-08.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

HQ SACT is seeking contractor support to conduct analysis and research into the techniques, processes and procedures that can be used to optimize bandwidth utilization when XML technology is being used for information exchange and interoperability. The study will utilize a demonstrator capability in its research and the results will be made available to the NATO nations so that system planners and program managers are better able to scope their future bandwidth requirements.

Firms that have performed contracts within the last three years substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation are eligible to apply.

Contractor personnel performing services under the contract must be citizens of a NATO nation, possess at least a valid NATO SECRET level security clearance, and have appropriate experience in a related field. 

Please note that it is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

The IFIB package will contain material at the level of NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

Contracted outputs will be delivered to HQ SACT in Norfolk VA. There may be, however, a requirement for travel to additional sites in support of the contract.

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects:

The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Those firms that are nominated to the bidders list before the deadline will receive e-mail notification that the IFIB documents have become available for downloading from the following website:

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to KVH Industries, Inc, 50 Enterprise Ctr., Middletown, RI 02842-5279 for the procurement of six (6) MV103DG Digital Magnetic Compass System, P/N 01-0155-02. This procurement is sole source for the following reasons: (1) The Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Vehicle was first delivered in 1984 and had a service-life design of 21 years. Currently, the Navy has a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the LCAC. Under SLEP, the LCAC will enter the 21st century with markedly improved performance and an increased life span. The Digital Magnetic Compass (DMC) is specifically designed by KVH Industries and is the only Digital Magnetic Compass that is 100% compatible for re-use of the existing LCAC SLEP equipment. Use of another company's compass may introduce new or change existing parameters that may do more harm than good to the LCAC!   system. Failure of the LCAC system could result in loss of life as well as significant damage and maybe even loss of fleet assets. Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 334511 applies.  SBA Size Standard is 750 employees. FSC is 6605.

<DESC>Institute of Museum and Library Services
Assessment of the Impact of Public Access Computing at Public Libraries

Posting for Federal Business Opportunities


Contracting Office Address: 
Institute of Museum and Library Services, Office of the Director, 1800 M St., NW 9th floor, Washington, DC 20036

Description: 

The Institute of Museum and Library Services helps builds the capacity of the nation?s museums and libraries through grants, convenings, research and communications.  The Institute provides resources for museums and libraries to sustain our cultural heritage, foster learning and innovation, and build professional capacity.  The Institute is authorized to undertake research on national trends of museum and library services and to report on the impact and effectiveness of services provided by museums and libraries.  In 2007, IMLS will oversee a study of the impact on individuals, families, and communities of public access computing services provided at public libraries throughout the United States.  Public access computing is defined here as free access to computers and the Internet through public libraries and to the services that public libraries provide to help patrons use computers and find online information they need.  The study seeks to document the value that access to computers and information brings for the social, economic, personal, and professional well-being of individuals and communities across the nation.  For many, the library provides the preferred, and sometimes only, means of access to services and information to help find a job, help with homework, obtain health, medical, or financial information, connect with family, or submit online forms.  The study intends to identify a set of indicators to measure the beneficial impact where public access computing is present, and conversely, the negative impact where access is low or weak.  IMLS is conducting the study with the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  

IMLS expects that the study will focus on key areas of specific impact (e.g., education, economic development, health literacy, immigrant acculturation, and social connectness) and that the offeror will identify appropriate levels of measurement and sampling methods for the data collection and analysis. IMLS encourages eligible organizations to partner or collaborate in response to this solicitation. The findings of the study will assist in allocation and distribution of resources, development of technology strategies, and the evaluation of technology plans, and will be of value to community planners; federal, state and local governments; policy makers; information specialists; and library officials.  IMLS anticipates posting the solicitation on or around January 31, 2007 with a deadline of March 19, 2007, and awarding a contract on or around April 2, 2007.  The study is expected to take one year to complete.

PDRM shall be applied to SEAS data analyzed both by atomic absorption (AA) and by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS)  The EPA believes that the University of Maryland is the only source capable of  satisfying the government's requirement for the following reasons:  (1)  The SEAS sampler was developed by the University of Maryland's research group, and they hold the patent on the instrument; (2) the PDRM model was developed by the research group at the University of Maryland; and, (3) the  University of Maryland's research laboratory is the repository for the SEAS samples collected in St. Louis, on which work to be accomplished under the purchase order will be based. The circumstance permitting soliciting from a single source is FAR 13.106-1, "...contracting officers may solicit from  one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available..."  Interested persons seeking to challenge the sole source justification must present, in writing, clear and convincing evidence of their capability to provide  the requirements within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice.  Any response failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of an RFQ will be ignored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed  purchase order based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  No RFP/RFQ is available.  Submit responses to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency,  Attention:  Anna Mustard, RTP Procurement Operations Div. (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Description: The purpose of this announcement is to request white papers for the Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar (VADER) program.  Responses to this RFI will be reviewed by the Government and may result in an invitation to submit proposals against the BAA for a  3QFY07 award.  Award is not guaranteed and the Government does not intend to pay for information received. The goal of the VADER program is to provide tactical persistent surveillance and tracking of dismounts and vehicles over wide areas of the battle space.  VADER is a side looking, KU Band, Electronic scanning (azimuth), medium range radar with both very hig h resolution GMTI and SAR modes.  The radar system will have four GMTI modes and two SAR modes.  The GMTI modes include a wide-area MTI (WAMTI) mode for vehicles, a small-area MTI (SAMTI) mode for dismounts, a High Range Resolution (HRR) sub mode of the WA MTI, and High Range-Doppler Video modes for dismounts.  The SAR modes include a spotlight and strip map mode to resolutions as fine as six-inches in spot and twelve-inches in strip. VADER is comprised of three phases.  The purpose of this RFI is to support phases II and III which will begin in 3QFY07 and 3QFY08 respectively. The objective during phase II (12-months) is to integrate all technologies into an existing MTI workstation.  R eal data will be provided at month 3 to support development.  Lab prototype of the integrated workstation will occur at month 9 and full integration and test with live data will occur at month 12.  Phase III (6-months) will provide for technology upgrades and insertion of technologies not fully integrated during phase II. Technologies are sought across a number of specified application areas as listed in detail below.  MTI exploitation technologies beyond those listed below, will also be considered and are encouraged.  (1)  Automated Tracking - Algorithms capable of tracking dismounts are sought.  Trackers capable of tracking both dismounts and vehicles without aid of a priori classification (dismount vs. vehicle) are desired. (2)  Feature Aided Tracking - Tracking algorithms which use signature data derived from high resolution dwells of a target area, to enhance track length and purity are sought. Such algorithms should work, at a minimum, in conjunction with High-Range Resolu tion vehicle signatures.  Vendors who have this capability in conjunction with that described in (3) are preferred. (3)  Sensor Resource Management - Two core functions are sought through this component.  First, is to provide a means of tasking the radar to collect high resolution dwells at the appropriate times in support of (2) above.  Second is to provide a means of laying out basic wide-area coverage over multiple areas of interest such that track-ability of targets and coverage are optimized. In both instances this algorithm will have direct control of the sensor.  Sensor modes used for wide area applications will i nclude both SAR and GMTI. (4)  SAR Coherent Change Detection - A Coherent Change Detection capability is sought for Ku-band SAR Imagery.  Techniques should be as robust as possible for pass-to-pass geometry, autofocus and other image effects.  Additional capability of the CCD algor ithm to detect/extract change features is desired. (5)  GMTI Anomaly Detection/Pattern Matching - Techniques are desired which analyze real-time data streams and produce alerts/alarms when anomalous activities or pre-defined patterns are detected.  Anomalous activity may be considered as any GMTI contact w hich does not fit within the normal spatial and temporal distribution of activity in the battlespace.  Pre-defined pat terns may be considered as any sequence of GMTI contacts over space and time which have been defined by the user as being indicative of threat activity.  Such techniques may use GMTI contacts and/or tracks. (6)  GMTI Classification - Techniques are sought which are capable of classifying and/or discriminating life-forms from raw I and Q and/or amplitude only range-doppler data.  These techniques should be capable of operating in real-time to support downstrea m tracking components.  Real data will be made available in 3QFY07 to support development. (7)  GMTI Data Mining - Techniques/tools are sought which provide analysts with the ability to data-mine GMTI histories for particular spatial/temporal events of interest.  Toolsets may use contacts or tracks for analysis. In support of integrating each component into a larger workstation, it is desired that the following general design characteristics be considered by all components.  All components should be developed to fit within a service-oriented framework (J2EE).  All  services should be well-defined and self-contained.  Additionally, any necessary Graphical User Interfaces should be developed as Java plug-ins. Responses to this RFI should be no more than 10 single sided pages per technology area (as outlined above), of size 10 or 12 font.  Responses should clearly convey the underlying technology, level of maturity, sponsor of the work, description of work neces sary to demonstrate the technology and integrate into an existing workstation, and rough magnitude of cost and schedule to achieve desired readiness.  Also indicate the security clearance level of the facility and principal personnel doing the work. Responses are to be received by 12:00 EST, 5 February 2007.  All information must be in writing or via e-mail.  You may forward responses to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN:  AMSRD-CER-IW-RA (David Thomas) or the fo llowing e-mail addresses: david.thomas9@us.army.mil and robert.luisi@us.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  If you choose to submit proprietary information, mark it accordingly.  Classified information will be accepted by mail only, but please mark it accordingly and send it via proper channels.

The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 SMART servers, along with these other components have been identified as key component of the Departments SMART server infrastructure.   IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified and classified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.   As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed.  Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs. Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost.<BR><BR>The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 Servers, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 Servers, and related infrastructure equipment described in paragraph (2) have been identified as key components of the Departments SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State. The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.    Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.After extensive testing, the HP servers were the only servers found to be compatible with the Departments existing hardware and software.<BR><BR>HP CTO FACTORY BUILT CONFIGURATIONS ARE ACCEPTABLE<BR><BR>ALL SERVER CONFIGURATIONS MUST BE FULLY INTEGRATED PRIOR TO SHIPMENT<BR><BR>REPOSTED TO INCLUDE TERMS: 1) CTO ACCEPBABLE 2) ALL SERVER COMPONENTS MUST BE INTEGRATED COMPLETELY PRIOR TO SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY.<BR><BR>AMENDED LINE ITEMS 002, 004, 008 & 011.<BR><BR>LINE ITEM 005, REDUCED COMPONENT # 410061-B21: HP DL580 G4 Memory Expansion Board FROM QTY FROM 3 EA TO 2 EA<BR><BR>A) REPOSTED TO REMOVE THE FOLLOWING FROM LINE ITEMS 002 & 004: "(1-each)		8GB Fully Buffered DIM PC2-5300, 8 x 1GB" B) HP, EQUAL CTO parts ACCEPTABLE<BR><BR>

Who we are:AmeriCorps*VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America)
AmeriCorps VISTA was created in 1964 for the purpose of strengthening and supplementing efforts to eliminate poverty in the U.S.  VISTA provides full-time volunteers (members), as a resource, to nonprofit community organizations and public agencies to create and expand programs that ultimately bring low-income individuals and communities out of poverty.  The VISTA member is a resource whose role is to generate the commitment of private sector resources, encourage volunteer service at the local level and to build the capacity of local agencies and organizations to build sustainable anti-poverty programs. VISTA members spend one year in full-time service on a project that addresses the needs of low-income communities.  VISTA is administered by The Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation), a Federal Government agency. Annually, approximately 6,000 individuals serve as VISTA members, and over 160,000 have served since 1964.  The VISTA program, headquartered in Washington DC, is managed locally through Corporation State Offices.  The State Offices accept applications from local organizations and agencies who are interested in using the VISTA resource to develop or expand their anti-poverty program.  Corporation program staff members sign Memoranda of Agreement with organizations that demonstrate a solid plan for using the VISTA resource to build organizational capacity and develop a program that is sustainable.  The typical length of a VISTA project is 3 to 5 years. 

Project Sponsoring Organizations (Sponsors)
Sponsors are the community based organizations and public agencies that apply to the Corporation for VISTA members to serve at their project.  Sponsors direct the project, supervise the VISTA member, and provide the necessary administrative support to complete the goals and objectives of the project.  

Potential Services Sought:The Domestic Volunteer Service Act (DVSA) outlines the objectives of VISTA as:1.to generate the commitment of private sector resources;2.to encourage volunteer service at the local level, and 3.to strengthen local agencies and organizations.  All of the above objectives are in support of strengthening and supplementing efforts to eliminate and alleviate poverty and poverty-related problems in the US. Currently, VISTA is able to evaluate and measure the first two objectives. 

Our Sources sought notice relates to the third objective, and how we can envoke capacity building.  We are looking for a company who can establish a method of measuring and evaluating this objective. VISTA  is interested in exploring evaluating and measuring capacity building.  VISTA is committed to initiating an external evaluation to assess the programs performance in building the capacity of local organizations to carry out sustainable anti-poverty programs.  Furthermore, the 2006 Performance Rating Assessment Tool (PART) called for VISTA to look at how it currently measures and evaluates the programs objectives.Proposed Processes Needed for Capacity Building Study:
1.Coordinate with the Corporation and AmeriCorps*VISTA; 2.Develop Evaluation Plan; 3.Design and Pretest Data Collection Instruments for Study Participants; 4.Obtain OMB Clearances; 5.Locate and Track Study Participants; 6.Conduct data collection for Study Participants;7.Analyze Data and Report Results; 8.Create Data Files for Further research;9.Create An Evaluation and Measurement Tool for further usage.  

Study Goals:The primary goal of this project is to design a measurement tool to assess VISTAs performance in supporting and strengthening local organizations and agencies in their fight against poverty. We want this project to answer the question:Is VISTA supporting and strengthening local organizations and agencies in alleviating poverty? If yes, how?. We are also seeking to determine capacity indicators that we can link to overall performance as a continuous measurement.

Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.

<DESC>PURPOSE OF MODIFICATION: To include the quantity of hours to be procured under this contract modification. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to modify Contract N00024-06-C-6353 with BAE Systems, Information and Electronic Systems Integration (IESI) of 65 Spit Brook Road, P.O. Box 868, Nashua, NH 03061 to add hours (quantity 6,000) for engineering support services for the Quick Reaction Dismounted (QRD) JCREW Production contract. This effort will enhance the operating functionality of these Dismounted CREW systems, and is essential to ensuring that these systems protect U.S. personnel from the threat posed by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Engineering support services are required for analysis, design and tradeoff studies for modifications that will increase system effectiveness or ease the use; for threat loadset and software improvements to enable the system to address new and emerging threats; and for on-going effectiveness, interoperability, communication compatibility, changing threat level, and radiation hazard testing for the QRD systems.  BAE Systems, In!  formation and Electronic Systems Integration is the current producer of the Dismounted CREW systems, and the only contractor that possesses the requisite knowledge and experience on this Dismounted JCREW system to meet the Governments requirement. Thus, BAE is the only reasonable source available that can satisfy JCREW Program requirements in accordance with the requirements outlined in Contract N00024-06-C-6353. The period of performance is for approximately one (1) year for engineering support services, with work ending in February 2008. Contract modification will be awarded pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c)(1). Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact BAE Systems, Information and Electronic Systems Integration (IESI) directly. See Numbered Note 22*****

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates interceptor aircraft to detect, deter and mitigate threats to our homeland such as terrorists, acts of terrorism, drug smuggling and other unlawful movement of people, money, and goods across U.S. borders.  CBP wishes to explore the feasibility and practicality of upgrading the avionics and mission systems, initially on its 10 Citation II Lot III jets and potentially the remaining 16 Citation II jets.  The intent of the upgrade is to improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness as well as lower life cycle support costs.  To reduce program costs and enhance equipment availability and support, the avionics and sensor systems should incorporate open architecture and "commercial-off-the-shelf" non-developmental item equipment to the maximum extent possible.  Those systems must be cost effective to operate and fully supportable (parts, technical assistance, etc.) for 20 years beyond the date of acquisition.  They should also be currently in production, operationally viable (demonstrable) and capable of being easily retrofitted with updated configurations. 



2.0	REQUEST

CBP is seeking information on prime contractors who can install and integrate commercially available avionics and sensor systems, including electronic flight instrument displays that are night vision goggle compatible and reduced visual separation minimum (RVSM) compliant.  The sensor suite will include multi-mode radar and electro-optical/ infrared (EO/IR) sensors.  System performance, size, weight, power and cooling requirements and life cycle support will be important considerations for this modernization effort.  The Maximum combined weight for the complete integrated Radar and EO/IR system shall not exceed 370 pounds.  Interested vendors must be capable of demonstrating their avionics and sensor systems as an integrated end product.  



MINIMUM OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS (GENERAL):



2.1	Radar System

AN/APG-66 radar, which are currently installed in the modified noses of CBP Citation Interceptor jets, are integrated with EO/IR sensors and capable of slewing EO/IR tracked targets.  Replacement radar should have comparable system performance, size, weight, power and cooling requirements as that radar.  At a minimum, the radar should provide 120-degree azimuth and elevation coverage with an automatic capability to detect and track air and surface targets.  Radar capabilities should include the following:

	Air-to-air radar detection, tracking and sorting of various size aircraft;
	Air-to-ground radar detection, tracking and sorting of moving vehicles;
	Air-to-sea radar detection, tracking and sorting of various size vessels;
	Air-to-ground high-resolution radar imaging;
       Radar Slave to EO/IR Functionality;
	10 target (minimum) Track While Scan mode; and
	2 target (minimum) Situation Awareness Mode (SAM)

The radar system should include a Built-in-Test (BIT) mode to accomplish failure detection and failure isolation to a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) without the assistance of radar support equipment at the organization level.  In addition, the BIT mode shall provide the aircrew, via the onboard radar display, and ground maintenance personnel, via a ground accessible display, the capability to determine radar operational readiness.    



2.2	Electro-optical/Infrared Sensor

The EO/IR sensor shall be housed in a 360-degree continuous rotation turret that is capable of performing long-range visual search, surveillance, and tracking from an airborne platform.  It should be capable of performing those functions in the visible light spectrum as well as the mid-wave infrared spectrum.  The EO/IR sensor shall be interfaced with the radar, capable of slaving to tracked radar targets, and providing automatic focus and video tracking in all electro-optical and infrared modes with operator selectable optical focal lengths.  Additional functionality shall include an eye-safe laser range finder for determining the range to a target of interest and a high-power laser pointer for illuminating a target of interest with night vision goggle compatible light.  The EO/IR sensor payload should include:

	A color TV camera;
	A color TV Spotter Scope; 
	An infrared thermal imager with a minimum of three distinct fields of view;

The BI tools shall be used to extract, mine, and stratify data that is currently available at an individual case level, from the various HUD information sources such as the Single Family Data Warehouse. The BSP shall transform the data into information and reports that can be used to create new reporting mechanisms, to statistically measure, and to effectively and efficiently create a single data repository the following examples of data and information:
1.	Reduce FHA Mortgage default rates;
2.	Respond rapidly to legislative and policy changes;
3.	Respond rapidly to requests from HUD Senior Management;
4.	Provide effective oversight to lenders and loan servicers.

The contract shall remove these historic data limitations by providing the system capacity and analytical abilities to improve data extractions and administer the historical data and reports, and provide access to HUD employees and their designees.

The BSP shall be expected to extract, drill down, and stratify data from the various HUD systems for macro and micro level analysis of the FHA Insured portfolio.  The rationale for the analysis at the micro level is to identify specific performance indicators, weaknesses and strengths in the servicing of the FHA insured loan portfolio, while considering multiple factors contributing to lender and portfolio performance.  The contractor shall anticipate the need to integrate external source information such as market/property values with the data available within our current systems of record.

The contract shall be awarded to an industry-proven BSP that can provide the required services on a web-based platform operating outside the Department?s technical environment. 

The Contractor shall furnish all necessary services, equipment, materials and supplies, facilities, personnel, and supervision needed to accomplish the requirements unless otherwise specified. The Contractor shall maintain complete and accurate servicing files, including both computerized notes and hard copies of documents generated by any servicing actions.  The contract will be for a base period of 12 months and four (4) - 12 month option periods.  The estimated price range is between $3 million and $6 million. Interested small business concerns need to respond to this inquiry by January 30, 2007 at 10:00am MST with the requested information as stated below. Fax the information to (303) 672-5062, Attn: Michael Ku. Telephone calls will not be considered.

Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service 
National Veterinary Stockpile

Request for Information for
Depopulation, Disposal and Decontamination Services for Large Scale Domestic Outbreaks of Animal Diseases

Statement of Need
The US Depart of Agriculture?s Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service?s National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS) program exists to augment state and local resources in the fight against dangerous animal diseases that could potentially devastate American agriculture, seriously affect the economy, and threaten the public?s health. 

The NVS seeks information from industry on the availability of turnkey services for animal depopulation, disposal, and cleaning and decontamination services during large scale animal disease outbreaks. Turnkey means providing the necessary skilled personnel, management, equipment, vehicles, materials, permits, personnel protective equipment, certifications and OSHA training, hazardous material transportation, and logistics for responding to disease outbreaks. Potential diseases include Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, Foot-and-Mouth Disease, Rift Valley Fever, Exotic Newcastle Disease, and Classical Swine Fever. Animals that may be affected include poultry, hogs, cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. 

Examples of large scale outbreaks include Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Exotic Newcastle Disease (END). In 2001, an FMD outbreak in the United Kingdom resulted in depopulating and disposing of 3.9 million hoofed animals on over 9,300 farms. At the height of the outbreak, over 60,000 animals per week were euthanized and disposed of. In 1971, an END outbreak in California resulted in depopulating and disposing of nearly 12 million birds. 

The NVS seeks vendors who can offer turnkey service using proven methods for humanely depopulating and disposing of large numbers of diseased animals. The vendors should also be able to clean and decontaminate affected areas, equipment and personnel.  Depending on the disease and other variables, disposal options may include onsite or remote composting, rendering, alkaline hydrolysis, thermal destruction (air curtain incineration, fixed incineration) and onsite or remote burial. Vendors should be familiar with these methods and know how best to respond to potential scenarios.





Vendor Capabilities and Experience 

The NVS would like to talk to vendors with the following or similar capabilities and experience: 

?	Emergency response experience handling hazardous material, including disposal and decontamination. This experience should preferably include experience with bio-hazardous materials.  
?	An understanding of the agricultural industry, regulatory practices including humane treatment of animals, and agencies. 
?	Practical experience working within an incident command system during emergencies.
?	An understanding of the National Response Plan, 
?	Knowledge of the USDA and state animal disease response plans. 
?	The ability to provide a turnkey response for the humane depopulation and disposal of affected animals and the cleaning and decontamination of equipment, personnel, and vehicles for large animal disease outbreaks. 
?	Experience managing large scale (150+ responders under direct supervision) emergency response operations. Experience with disposal and decontamination operations is highly desirable.   
?	Capability of responding to multiple outbreaks simultaneously.
?	Ability to scale operations to meet the demands of responses as they increase in size.
?	Experience working with federal and state governments.

Information Requested:

If you believe you meet the above criteria, please send an email by 02/16/2007 to nvs@aphis.usda.gov with your qualifications, experience, and the following: 

?	Company name
?	Contact information, 
?	Web site URL, 
?	Number of fulltime employees,
?	Capability to provide qualified surge manpower and equipment, 
?	Subcontractors and role, 
?	References from large scale responses, and the location, summary of operation, size and duration of relevant responses,
?	Previous experience with animal depopulation, disposal and decontamination.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: This synopsis is for the purpose of obtaining market research only.  NO PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED OR ACCEPTED UNDER THIS SYNOSPIS OR UNDER THIS SOLICITATION NUMBER.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, will use information obtained under this synopsis to develop an acquisition strategy to meet the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Custom and Border Protection (CBP) Infrastructure Supply Program needs.  The intent of this synopsis is to access industrys  (large and small business concerns (including 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Historically U nderutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)) capable and interested in providing various  construction material and supplies to support the DHS/CBP Infrastructure Supply Program within the Southwestern Re gion (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas), Northwestern Region (Washington), and Northeastern Region ((Michigan and New York) of the United States.  The DHS/CBP infrastructure supply program need is estimated to be $300 Million over the next five y ears.   Of the $300 Million, it is estimated that ninety percent (90%) of the infrastructure supply program placement will occur in the Southwestern Region.  The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code related to this program  is 444190, with corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 5211;  Business Size Stardard is $6.5 Million.  It is anticipated that the DHS/CBP Infrastructure Supply Program need may be meet through the use of a multiple award process to establish various  Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs).  The multiple award approach results in the establishment of qualified pools of contractors (each pool may have 3 to 6 firms) that may compete un der an IDIQ MATOC to provide the required supplies.  It is anticipated that a total of four MATOCs (2 Southwestern Region and 1 each for the Northwestern and Northeastern) may be awarded to support the DHS/CBP Infrastructure Supply Program. Each MATOC will  include a minimum order limitation that is anticipated to be $2,500 and a maximum order limitation that is anticipated to range from $3-$5 Million.  The maximum order limitation may be decreased based on industrys capability as annotated in response to t his synopsis.  The Government is seeking qualified, experienced and reliable sources capable of providing simultaneously the delivery of various construction materials and supplies needed to support infrastructure supply projects.  These projects may be lo cated in remote areas based on the location of the local CBP Sector and may be needed to support infrastructure ion requiements such as, roads, low-water crossings, temporary and permanent vehicle barriers, pedestrian barriers, stadium lighting, fencing, a nd bridges. Typical supplies for these requirements often include, but is not limited to, concrete, tubing, steel, fence material, aggregate, asphalt, relay rail, barbed wire, compressed cylinders, wood, plastic, pvc material, asphalt roof cement, quickcre te, sealer concrete, silica sand, hoists, tubes, tools, various metals, fiber boxes, etc.  Considering the $300 Million program amount and the anticipated supplies, approximately 15% would be concrete (typically 300 psi), 20% for tubing (which could be squ are or round tubing, typically 5 inch or 6 inch square, or 4 inch to 6 inch round tubing, with wall thicknesses of 0.25 inch or greater), 20% for various aggregate base or other fill materials, and 15% Relay Rail (number 1 to 90 pounds).  The remaining 30%  is for miscellaneous materials and or supplies.  An example of an anticipated delivery order for material is:  Delivery supplies for one (1) mile (length) of v ehicle barrier material: 580 each 5x5x0.25 square tubing (21 feet long); 264 each 5x5x0.25 square tubing (20 feet long); 250 Cubic Yards of concrete (3000 psi); 700 pounds Welding Rods; 8 O2 Bottles; and 8 acetelyne bottles. Another example is:  Deliver 10 0 feet (length) of BOLLARD FENCE installed on 8.5 inch centers which may require the following supplies and or materials: 20 6x6x0.25 length of pipe. Other material options might be 1500 6x6x.280 std pipe X 21 new; 1500 6X6x.250 square tubing at 20 new; 15 00 6x4x.188 rec tubing at 20 new; concrete 3000 PSI; 4 OD Pipe Fill; 4 O2 bottles; 4 acetelyne bottles, etc. It is anticipated that the MATOC will include requirements to provide rapid delivery for required material.  The anticipated rapid delivery period may range from 24-72 hours from receipt of the delivery order.  The standard delivery period is anticipated to range from 48 hours to 2 weeks from receipt of the delivery order.   Large deliveries may be staggered to accommodate mission requirements.

These kits are needed to conduct and complete a major project of the Lab.  These kits are used to amplify and label oyster messenger RNA so that gene expression in response to environmental challenge can be quantified using gene microarrays.  The amplification involves the generation of aminoallyl-modified RNA, and the labeling step involves the conjugation of Cy3 dye to the aminoallyl-derivatized RNA.  These kits are needed to analyze messenger RNA from oysters collected from field sites and to compare these results with those already obrtained for messenger RNA from oysters challenged under con trolled laboratory conditions.  The studies on the laboratory-challenged oysters have been completed, and were all conducted using Ambion AA MessageAMp II Cy3 20rxn kits.  It is necessary that the analysis on the messenger RNA from the field collected oysters be conducted using exactly the same methods and reagents as for the laboratory challenged oysters.  If the methods and reagents used in the two projects are not the same, then the results will not be comparable and the design of the experiments and the analysis of the data will be open to question and challenge.  In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.

FAR 52.212-2  Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition:
 (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-price factors.  The following two (2) non-price factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:  Factor 1-Technical capability to perform work identified in the Performance Work Statement and Factor 2-Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a (go/no go) basis.  If a proposal has been determined acceptable (go) on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its proposal evaluated for the lowest price.
Factor 1 Technical capability to perform work identified in the PWS.
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of the following information demonstrating the Contractor?s ability to perform:
1.	Evidence that the offeror operates an established business with experience in providing comparable collection and disposal of refuse;
2.	Evidence that the offeror can provide the necessary personnel, equipment and financial resources needed to perform in accordance with the PWS;
3.	Resume of the contract manager who will be responsible for the performance under this contract indicating that this person is capable of reading, writing, speaking and understanding English.
4.	Plan ensuring how the contractor will meet the collection schedule in the PWS and respond to missed pickups and customer complaints. 

Factor 2 Past Performance.
By past performance the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely response.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  
In evaluating an offeror?s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror?s proposal and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; Federal, State or Local Governments and/or commercial sources.  The information provided should reflect similar contracts for the same or similar type service.  The offeror shall provide:
1.  Past experience for preferably three contracts that the offeror has performed within the past 5 years or is performing for projects similar in scope and size to the one described in the Government performance work statement to include the following information:
(1)	Company/Division Name
(2)	Project Title
(3)	Contract Number
(4)	Brief description of the contractual effort
(5)	Period of Performance
(6)	Contract Dollar Value
(7)	Current points of contact (include name, address, phone and fax numbers)
2.  A list of any significant problems encountered for the contracts reported in response to paragraph (1) above.  General examples are:  employees not reporting to work on time and customer complaints, i.e., damaged property.  Include also a brief description of how these problems were handled and remedied.
 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision)
FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items Alternate I. Offerors must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items with their proposal or indicate that the registration has been completed at the ORCA website http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include this information with the price proposal will render an offeror ineligible for award.

FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services
The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.

<SUBJECT>61--Procurement of Certified Category III-3 Instrumentation Grade Laboratory Protection System (LPS)
<SOLNBR>W81XWH12349786
<RESPDATE>013107
<ARCHDATE>04012007
<CONTACT>John Fitzsimmons, 301-619-1345
<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Franek Technologies.  The procurement will provide the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBFAC) with mission critica l equipment. The NBFAC is requesting a certified category II-3 instrumentation grade laboratory protection system (LPS).  In the event of a power outage, the LPS system will be sued to provide backup power for an Applied Biosystems Prism 3130XL Genetic Ana lyzer and a 7900HT Sequence Detection System with automation tower, plate shuttle, and laptop controller.  LPS category III-3 products are specifically designed to protect laboratory and/or life science/medical equipment and their unique electrical loading  requirements.    Any company that believes that it can meet these requirements is invited to submit written notification to the Contract Specialist within 15 calendar days from the date of the publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficie nt detail to demonstrate the companys ability to meet the requirement.  Information may be sent by email to the Contract Specialist at: john.fitzsimmons@amedd.army.mil .  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, responses r eceived from responsible businesses prior to close of business on 31 January 2007 will be evaluated.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source order.  See numbered Note 22. 1. Contracting Activity: The contracting activity responsible for this action is the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD. 2. Description of Action: This approval is being requested for a new firm-fixed price contract using R&D funds. 3. Description of Supplies/Services: The requested materials include two certified category III-3 instrumentation grade laboratory protection system (LPS) for and Applied Biosystems Prism 3130XL genetic Analyzer and four certified category III-3 instrument ation grade laboratory protection system (LPS) for an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System with automation tower, plate shuttle, and laptop controller.  This will be a one time purchase with delivery to be no later than 5 January 2007.  The estimated value of these items is totaled at $34,065 (this includes shipping). 4. Authority Cited: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10U.S.C 2304  (1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1 and the FAR title is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requireme nts.  5. Reason for Authority Cited: FTI products are tested, certified, and recommended by Agilent, Applied Biosystems, Roche and Thermo Electron, respectively.  FTI category III-3 LPS products are specifically designed to protect laboratory and/or life science /medical instrumentation and their unique electrical loading requirements that are required to meet US HHS CMS (HCFA) 42 CFR part 493 (CLIA), FDA 21 CFR part 11, and when applicable section 510(k) 21 CFR part 807 sub part E for patient contact and/or criti cal care medical devices.  Computer grade UPS (category I or II commercial grade) products are not specifically designed and/or tested for instrumentation applications and may not compensate for laboratory or medical instrumentation cyclical operation as w ell as potentially voiding the instrumentations warranty, if misapplied. 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Not applicable, NO effort will be made to solicit offers from as many potential sources as is practicable as there is only one source capable of performing the required services, given the need to ensure the consistency an d scientific quality of the assays to be performed.  No effective competition is anticipated. 7. Actions to Increase Competition: To date no actions to increase competition have been initiated.  The equipment to be purchased is specifically manufactured  to provide sufficient power backup for the equipment we currently have in the laboratory. 8. Market Research: Market research was conducted to find other UPS systems to support ABI instruments; however none could handle the required work load.  Additionally, the manufacturer (ABI) of the instruments for which the UPS systems will be purchased h as collaborated with FRANEK Technologies to develop and optimize UPS systems that will specifically support ABI instrumentation. 9. Interested Sources: To date no other sources have written to express an interest.   10. Other Facts a. Procurement history: Reasonable efforts to retrieve the following items from computer records, contract files, competition advocate office files or other sources are expected: (1) Contract numbers and dates of the last several awards. Not applicable (2) Competitive status of these actions. Not applicable (3) Authority previously used for less than full and open competition. Not applicable (4) If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, a summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an explanation of the results. Not applicable (5) If any prior award was accomplished by full and open competition, a detailed explanation of the changed circumstances. Not applicable (6) An explanation of any unusual patterns which may be revealed by the history, e.g., several consecutive, urgent buys. Not applicable (7) If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, briefly describe the circumstances justifying the buy and whether there have been any significant changes. Not applicable b. Acquisition data availability: A statement of work suitable for full and open competition can be developed for this procurement.  It is not being completed because in order to maintain the merit and validity of scientific research, there is only one sou rce that can render the service requested. c. Unusual and compelling urgency: Not applicable d. Subcontracting competition: Not applicable This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This requirement includes the following:



LINE ITEM 0001

1)               Vendor shall provide 20 truncated rectangular pyramids of accurately dimensioned oriented graphite block of specified chemical purity, density, mosaic distribution, and neutron transmission characteristics for MACS Scattered Beam Filter.     Thickness: 50mm.     Ref: Drawing     03802453 Rev-5. 
                     
2)               Vendor shall provide pre-performance material sample (one month after receipt of order and prior to beginning of the production run).     The pre-performance materials sample shall be representative of the filter material to be delivered. The pre-performance sample, can be a laminated structure, and shall have a thickness along the c-direction of 50 mm. The dimensions in both orthogonal directions perpendicular to the c-axis shall be between 20 mm and 50 mm.

3)       Vendor shall provide a certified material analysis: Materials delivered under this order shall be accompanied by a certified materials analysis indicating the graphite and impurity content and the average mosaic distribution in the block as measured through X-ray diffraction.     

The government will perform at least two types of analysis on the pre-performance materials sample and will report the results to the vendor within 1 month of receiving the sample. The analysis will include: 

	1)       Diffraction using 14.7 meV neutrons to determine the mosaic 			distribution.     
	2)       Measurement of the neutron transmission along the c-axis as a 			function of neutron energy. 

Upon vendor request, the government will also carry out such measurements on material intended for inclusion in the product during the production phase. The results of such measurements will be reported to the vendor within 1 month of receiving the material. The total quantity of material to be analyzed in this fashion shall not exceed the total amount of material ordered. 

The Government analysis of material provide by the vendor does not relieve the vendor from their responsibility with respect to meeting the requirements set forth herein.

	The materials shall meet the following specifications:

Materials Specifications 
Chemical Composition and Density:

This specification ensures sufficient content of the desired oriented graphite majority phase. 
-       Carbon as Pyrolytic Graphite >99% by weight
-       The overall density of each filter block (volume to be that defined by the corresponding drawings) shall exceed 95% of the room temperature density of Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite, which is 2.26g/cm3.

Mosaic Distribution
This specification is set to maximize transmission in the intended application and to maximize efficiency as a filter for higher order neutrons. 
-       The average c-axis direction for a filter block shall be parallel to the high symmetry axis (the beam direction) of the blocks to within 1 degree. 
-       The average Full Width at Half Maximum Mosaic width for each of the twenty filter blocks as measured with 14.7 meV neutrons shall not exceed 5 degrees.

Neutron Transmission Specification
This specification ensures adequate neutron transmission in the operating energy range. Factors that reduce neutron transmission are neutron absorbing impurities, lattice defects, large mosaic distribution widths, and graphite powder inclusions.
-       The neutron transmission coefficient shall exceed 65% under these conditions: 
	o       Room temperature. 
	O       Neutron energies from 2.5 meV to 7 meV and 8 to 14.7 meV 
	o       Transmission along the c-axis. 

Overall Physical Dimensions and Lamination Requirements

The physical dimensions, tolerances and surface finish of the twenty filter blocks are specified on the attached drawings.

The filter blocks can be built as laminated structures detailed by the vendor. If the vendor builds the filter blocks as laminated structures, then they must adhere to the following requirements in order to ensure that the potentially laminated bodies can be mounted effectively and that there are no open joints along beam axis 
      	Lamination planes shall be perpendicular to the central axis of the 	blocks.      	
	This requirement is to prevent streaming through cracks in the lamination.             	The lamination structure shall preclude straight line neutron propagation 	within 10 degrees of the cylinder axis without passage through at least 35 	mm solid graphite. 
     	The overall density of the laminated bodies with volume as defined by the 	corresponding drawings shall be at least 95% of the density of highly 		oriented pyrolytic graphite. 


Acceptance: 

A certification of compliance with all specifications from the vendor shall be a condition for acceptance. In addition, one or more of the following acceptance tests will be carried out to ensure compliance with specifications: 
       	Physical inspection to assure that the dimensions and tolerances are                                             	consistent with the supplied drawings. 
       	
	Measurement of the weight of the filter blocks to determine whether the 	overall density (with volume as specified by the corresponding drawing) 	exceeds 95% of the density of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. 
       
	Measurement of the overall mosaic distribution of the filter block (using14.7 meV neutrons). 
            Neutron diffraction measurements to ensure that the average c-axis 	direction coincides with the high symmetry axis of the filter blocks to within 1degree.

      	Measurement of the neutron transmission along the c-axis for a range of 	neutron energies. 

The Government intends to carry out the above testing within one month of delivery of the filter blocks.     The vendor may deliver the filter blocks in batches of five (5) provided that all twenty (20) units are delivered within six months After Receipt of Order (ARO).
