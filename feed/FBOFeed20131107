The Government plans to utilize a firm fixed price contract with a 2-year base and three 1-year options.  This is a sole source requirement to Longbow Limited Liability Company (LBL), Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code 04WF2, 5600 Sand Lake Road, Orlando, FL 32819.  LBL is the original developer and manufacturer of the FCR and also current provider of PPSS to the United States Government (USG) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers, including RSLFAC.

As such, LBL is the only source capable of providing PPSS for its FCR systems.  Only LBL possesses the technical expertise and experience necessary to execute this requirement.  Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one source or a limited number of responsible sources are able to satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>DARPA seeks new methods for analysis and decoding of neural signals in order to understand how neural stimulation could be applied to facilitate recovery of memory encoding following brain injury. Ultimately, it is desired to develop a prototype implantable neural device that enables recovery of memory in a human clinical population. Additionally, the program encompasses the development of quantitative models of complex, hierarchical memories and exploration of neurobiological and behavioral distinctions between memory function using the implantable device versus natural learning and training.

<DESC><strong>This Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.</strong>
<p><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MedLog) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and DLA Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program anticipate issuing a Sources Sought Notification for the establishment of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Blood Collection Sets &amp; Needles through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on or about 01 March 2014. This is not a request for quote or proposal. </strong></p>
<p>Examples of items for the QSL could include but are not limited to: Blood Collection Sets &amp; Needles in various lengths and gauges. Safety, latex free or latex safe, and single use.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this effort will be to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL. The QSL for Blood Collection Sets &amp; Needles will be the basis of a separate Standardization Action (SA) resulting in an Incentive Agreement (IA). This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in the QSL process vendors must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. Vendors who previously had an active record in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and must validate that their account is Active in SAM. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, (215) 737-7124.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the QSL requirements will be provided in the QSL FBO Announcement. The purpose of this Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the QSL FBO is imminent. Upon issuance of the QSL FBO, all relevant information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website.</p>

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the continued support of a wide range of services related to engineering, technical, and facility maintenance trades to perform operations and maintenance of all MSFC facilities including Documentation, Work Control, and Reliability Centered Maintenance; Trouble Calls/Trouble Call Services; Engineering; Environmental Management Support; Facility Alarm and Monitoring Systems; Utilities and Surfaced Areas; Repair Buildings and Structures; Mechanical Systems; Steam Distribution System Operation; HVAC/R Systems; Electrical Distribution and Emergency Generating Systems; and Emergency Management Support under the current Center Operations Support Services (COSS) contract. &lt;p&gt; NASA/MSFC intends to purchase these services from URS Federal Technical Services, Inc. (URS). URS is uniquely positioned to continue providing the services necessary to perform operations and maintenance of all MSFC facilities and collateral equipment and other related functions in support of various NASA/MSFC programs and projects.  URS has been the COSS contractor for MSFC since 1998, having won the last three competitive procurements.  As a result, URS has developed within its management staff a unique knowledge and understanding of the requirements, operations, policies and processes across the various elements of MSFC and their facilities. Use of URS existing and proven capabilities will permit the timely execution of significant tasks that are necessary for maintaining safe and reliable facilities that support program and mission goals.  This requirement is for a continuation of ongoing work that is critical for mission success. This extension will act as a "bridge" between the COSS contract and the contract to be awarded as a result of the Facilities Operations and Maintenance Support Services (FOMSS) solicitation (NNM13440940J) for which proposals were received on September 16, 2013.  The extension will enable continued performance of the COSS contract through the completion of the FOMSS recompetition effort.  &lt;p&gt; The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  &lt;p&gt; Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 22, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for an echelle grating spectrometerr. The Catalina Scientific echelle grating spectrometer covers the spectral range from 310 to 900nm. The Catalina Scientific echelle grating spectrometer is intended to be used as a high resolution laboratory calibrating instrument with resolving power between 10,000 and 60,000 and as a field instrument for use at the NASA/GSFC, requiring small size and weight. The Catalina EMU-120/65 spectometer incorporates low cost user interchangeable grating cassettes that provide a range of spectral resolving powers ranging from 7,000 to over 60,000. This capability permits a wider variety of applications. The Catalina EMU-120/65 spectrometer uniquely has user interchangeable aperature stops that vary the light throughput. This interchangeable aperature stop gives the capability to observe different light sources ranging from laboratory spectral lamps to observing the extremely bright sun and much dimmer scatterd light from the sky. This capability is crucial for NASA/GSFCs intended research program that requires operating over a wide range of light intensities. The Catalina EMU-120/65 Echelle spectrometer has the lowest amount of stray light of any of the commercially available echelle grating spectrometers. Low stray light is essential for the observation and analysis of the spectral features of the atmosphere, using sunlight as a light source because of the large differences in intensity over the spectral range from 300 to 900 nm (UV to near infrared). The EMU-120/65 including the camera weighs less than 15 pounds, which is essential for NASA/GSFCs intended application as a portable instrument for use in the laboratory and in field operations. &lt;p&gt; Caltalina Scientific is the only vendor that has the characteristics described above, has interchangeable upgrades, and is low weight. &lt;p&gt; Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Friday November 22, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  &lt;p&gt; A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. &lt;p&gt; Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. &lt;p&gt; The Government intends to acquire a commcerical item using FAR PART 12. &lt;p&gt; All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. &lt;p&gt; NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>
The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Philadelphia Office intends to solicit on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis, computer aided legal research (CALR) services. The services will be accomplished through bridge modification under an existing Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract N00189-09-D-Z015.  The modification will include a base period of three months (beginning 1 January 2014) with three one month options.  This modification is being processed on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition, sole source to LexisNexis of 9393 Springboro Pike, Miamisburg, OH 45342-4424, under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a).
  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with LexisNexis since they are the only source that can provide the requisite services within the required timeframe.  The current contract expires at the end of December 2013.  A solicitation for the follow on contract is due to be issued shortly on a limited competition basis.  Contract award on a limited competition basis, however, will not likely take place in sufficient time to avoid a gap in services.  These services are essential to the Office of the General Counsel in order to provide required legal services to the Department of the Navy.  In the interim, only LexisNexis can provide the services for the short period following expiration of the current contract and award of the follow on contract.
  There is insufficient time to perform a limited competition for this bridge action.  Furthermore, award to other than Lexis will require training and issuance of passwords for all users for which there is insufficient time before the end of the current contract.  The applicable NAICS code is 541199 with a size standard of $6.5M.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent IS NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all requests received within 12 calendar days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  The Government will not pay for information received. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses to this synopsis should be mailed to the attention of Ms. Kristi Brown, Code 270.1A, FLC Norfolk, Philadelphia Office, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Phila., PA 19111-5083.  For questions regarding this announcement, contact Ms. Kristi Brown who can be reached by e-mail kristi.kershaw-brown@navy.mil.

<DESC>Technical Support for Assessing, Managing, and Communicating the Ecological and Human Health Risks of Contaminants in Water, Fish and Sediments and of Microbial Pathogens in Surface Waters (SOL-CI-13-00026)
The Standards and Health Protection Division (SHPD), which is under the Office of Science and Technology (OST) and within EPA's Office of Water (OW) requires contractor support to provide technical support for assessing, managing, and communicating the ecological and human health risks of contaminants in water, fish, and sediment of Microbial Pathogens in surface waters.  
The Standards and Health Protection Divisions (SHPD) responsibilities under the Clean Water Act of 1987 (CWA) and EPAs Strategic Plan include directing the national program for adoption of Water Quality Standards (WQS), developing prevention and remediation strategies to reduce the risk to human health and aquatic life resulting from contaminated fish and sediment, conducting a program for beach monitoring and advisories relating to microbial pathogens in surface waters, and preparing outreach and awareness materials, including developing instructional materials and presenting workshops. Contaminants in surface waters, sediments, and fish tissue pose threats to ecological and human health.  Microbial pathogens in surface waters also pose threats to human health through bathing beach exposure.  The Fish, Shellfish, Beaches, and Outreach Branch (FSBOB) is developing methods and guidance for EPA's program offices, state agencies, local governments, and nongovernmental organizati ons to assess, remediate, or otherwise manage, and communicate the risks associated with exposure to these contaminants and microbial pathogens.  FSBOB is also conducting studies to assess the national extent and severity of sediments and fish tissue contamination, as well as water-borne pathogens present at bathing beaches. The National Water Quality Standards Program provides support for the development, implementation and evaluation of WQS by identifying, assessing and controlling risks to aquatic ecosystems.  This support encompasses a broad range of activities, including the following:  regulation, policy, and guidance development; technical support to states/tribes/territories (e.g., modeling, use attainability analyses, and economic and benefits analyses); establishment of national WQS priorities; coordination of WQS reviews and national WQS promulgations; WQS outreach and training; and management of cross-media and multi-Agency policies for attainment of standards an d exposure goals.
The purpose of this contract is to provide technical support to the Agency in addressing the following task areas: 1.	Risk-based analyses; 2.	Economic and statistical analyses; 3.	Technical guidance, report development, and general program analysis; 4.	Compilation and analysis of national and international environmental data; 5.	Development and application of methods; 6.	Environmental assessments; 7.	Field sampling; 8.	Model development and applications; 9.	Laboratory analysis; 10.	Workshops, conferences, training, and logistical support; 11.	Expert/peer review support; 12.	Public outreach and technology transfer; 13.	Compilation, categorization, and summarization of comments; and 14.	Preparation of presentation materials.
The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, and services in support of the efforts identified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A draft PWS can be obtained from the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.   Be advised, Performance Work Statement changes are possible when the final RFP is released.  The proposed contract will be a cost-plus-fixed-fee-term ( level-of-effort) work assignment type contract for a period of 12 months including four 12 month option periods.  The base period will include 12,000 hours and increased quantity options will be at 12,000 hours per period for a total of 120,000 hours in total for all periods if all the potential LOE hours are realized.  The period of performance for the resultant contract is anticipated to begin on or about April 1, 2014.  This is a follow-on to contract EP-C-09-019.
The anticipated solicitation release date is November 22, 2013, and the close date shall be approximately 30 days thereafter.  The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis.  A copy of the solicitation will be available at the following location: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/. Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $14 million.  
Due to the nature of the PWS requirements, it is anticipated that interested parties with the expertise to perform this work could also have relationships (e.g. a parent/subsidiary/sister company affiliation or an existing contractual relationship), which presents the potential for significant organizational conflicts of interest.  It is the EPAs contention that a significant organizational conflict of interest would exist if award were to be made to firm within the following groups or to firms that have significant business or financial relationships with these firms:
-	Entities which develop/produce/import chemicals, including pesticides and agricultural products, and/or own/operate waste management/waste disposal firms which could discharge to waters of the United States. -	Entities which develop/manufacture/sell/import water treatment and/or waste water treatment equipment and/or chemicals. -	Entities which own or operate industrial or domestic waste treatment facilities, including operators of publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs). -	Entities that are holders of National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits or dischargers to NPDES permit holders, including water utilities and suppliers -	Entities that have, or have significant clients that have, a financial interest in either the issues or the outcomes of EPA decisions supported by work under the contract. -	Entities that have an interest in furthering the harvest, sale, or consumption of freshwater or marine fish and seafood, and entities that have significant business or financial relationships with such businesses.

Additionally, the solicitation will include the clause entitled Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC) which states in part that the contractor and any subcontractors will be ineligible to enter into business or financial relationships which would support or affect efforts to contest, oppose, or influence the contents of regulations, policies, limitations, standards, or criteria relating to the Clean Water Act, the adoption of water quality standards, fish consumption advisories, and bathing beach monitoring, without the prior written authorization from the cognizant EPA CO. This restriction shall be in effect during the life of the contract, and it shall remain in effect for a period of three years after the completion of work under the contract.
Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15- Contracting by Negotiation.  The point of contact is Erin Ridder, Contract Specialist, USEPA, 26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, Mail Code: NWD-001, Cincinnati, OH 45268, who may be reached via email at ridder.erin@epa.gov; or Noelle Mills, Contracts Officer, USEPA, 26 W.

<p>The Intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 561510 with a Size Standard of $19.0 million.</p>
<p>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-70 (effective September 30, 2013).</p>

<p>Description<br />The Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) requires continued support by the incumbent - CW Government Travel with providing official travel management services for Defense Travel Area 6 (DTA 6 - DoD Agencies, and DTA 6 - USMC).</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The DTMO requires the continuation of official travel management and related additional services on a point of sale basis for Department of Defense (DoD) travelers assigned to DTA 6 sites. These CTO services are to support official travel activities of authorized DoD travelers who are under the authority of the referenced locations.

These CTO services shall be provided using both traditional methods and automated methods using the Defense Travel System (DTS) web portal.

<p>The current contract supports s DTA 6 - DoD Agencies, and DTA 6 - USMC. In the future competitive procurements, DTA 6- DoD Agencies and DTA 6 - DoD USMC will no longer be encompassed in one contract; therefore, we will be issuing two separate sole source bridge contracts, so when the competitive procurement of one area is complete, we can make that award without waiting for the other competitive procurement to finish.</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />Base period of six months, November 30, 2013 through May 31, 2014, with up to six two-month options from June 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015.</p>

Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirements within the PWS, and include: the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), and the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). All offerors shall have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov." <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be retained as Market Research.</p>

<DESC>Project Description: <br> The Canaveral lock was constructed in 1951 with timber approach guide walls extending approximately 600 feet from both the East and West side of the monolith lock structure. The approach timber guide walls were previously repaired in 1979, but the environmental deterioration has created some timber piles in a state of failure. This makes the deteriorated portions of the approach walls unsuitable to resist the required mooring or impact loads.  <br> Project scope is to provide a repair for the Canaveral Lock East and West timber approach walls to prevent failure and restore the walls to an operational condition. New fiberglass/concrete composite marine pilings shall be installed to replace the existing piles. Fiber-reinforced plastic <br> fenders and structural plastic framing will be removed and either replaced or reinstalled as detail in the contract drawings. Member connections shall use stainless hardware and all existing hardware shall be replaced with stainless steel. Existing creosote timber marine piles shall be removed at the mudline. All removed creosote timber bracing, marine piles, and fenders shall be disposed in an approved landfill. Work also includes the service of a dedicated manatee observer. Location: The work is located at the Canaveral Lock and Barge Canal, Canaveral Harbor, Brevard County, Florida along the eastern coastline of Florida. The Lock and Barge Canal work area can be accessed via Port Canaveral ocean entrance, Canaveral Barge Canal from the Intracoastal Waterway, and Interstate 95 and local connectors. The magnitude of construction for this project is estimated to be between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. THIS IS AN SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for research focusing in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD SERDP's intent to competitively fund research and development for environmental research that addresses the Statements of Need set forth in the Announcement. SERDP supports environmental research relevant to the management and mission of the DoD and supports efforts that lead to the development and application of innovative environmental technologies or methods that improve the environmental performance of DoD by improving outcomes, managing environmental risks, and/or reducing costs or time required to resolve environmental problems. <br>  <br> The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found on the DoD SERDP web site at www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/SERDP-Solicitations/Non-Federal-Core-Proposal-Instructions.  <br>  <br> To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with all instructions on the SERDP web site no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, January 9, 2014. No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.   <br>  <br> No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards may take the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. Submission of pre-proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan. <br>  <br> There is no commitment by SERDP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any cost incurred by the offeror before contract award is made. It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $8.0 million will be made dependent on the quality of proposals received and availability of funds.   <br>  <br>  <br> Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit research pre-proposals for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal. Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by SERDP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether SERDP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Personnel, and Cost. Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, SERDP will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Evaluation criteria for full proposals will include Transition Plan and Small Business Participation, in addition to the criteria above. <br>  <br> Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value. If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees. Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The HECSA Small Business Office web site at www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate. <br>  <br>  <br> Points of Contact: <br> Procedural Questions - SERDP, Ms. Jina Banks-Saunders, 571-372-6565. <br>  <br> Contract Questions - HECSA, Ms. Susan Hill, Susan.M.Hill@usace.army.mil or 703-428-6420 or alternate Ms. Shaquanda Williams, Shaquanda.C.Williams@usace.army.mil or 703-428-7081 <br>  <br> Small Business Participation Plan or Subcontracting Plan - HECSA, Mr. Kyle Beagle, kyle.j.beagle@usace.army.mil or 703-428-7385 <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address <br> US Army Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity  <br> ATTN: CEHEC-CT, 7701 Telegraph Road Alexandria, VA <br> Postal Code: 22315-3860 <br> Country: US <br>

<p>Aspen Plus, Aspen HYSYS, and Aspen Exchanger Design and Rating Desktop Software based on 1-year license term.</p>

<a href="mailto:marc.a.concilio.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Aberdeen Division B</a>
<DESC>1.  Synopsis.  This RFI/SSA is being issued to obtain information from interested sources regarding their ability to produce up to 13 LRIP AN/TPQ-53 Radar Systems that satisfy the technical performance requirements of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP)/Full Rate Production (FRP) Final Baseline Specification (FBS) for the AN/TPQ-53 Radar System (document number 77A582901) (herein referred to as the AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification [77A582901]) provided upon request to this RFI/SSA.  See paragraph 4, Description of Contract Action, for details.  <br>  <br> This RFI/SSA is being issued to accomplish market research.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI/SSA, or to otherwise pay for the information requested. This RFI/SSA shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or request for proposal. It shall not be used as the basis for a proposal.  <br>  <br> 2.  Program Overview.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System will serve as the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and AN/TPQ-37 Radar Systems.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System shall satisfy known current and future force concept requirements by interfacing with the global information grid and future force battle command systems.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System will provide the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar System is a highly mobile radar that will detect projectiles in-flight, as well as determine and communicate the firing point location of rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM).  It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions.  The system shall provide both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth.  The AN/TPQ-53 will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires.  <br>  <br> Current and future forces have a critical and immediate need for a RAM locating system that provides 360 degree detection coverage to mitigate capability gaps in force protection and target detection.  Brigade combat teams and fires brigades must quickly secure the operational area and the current counter fire systems introduce unnecessary risk to operations. <br>  <br> 3.   Procurement History.  In 2006, the Government awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin following full and open competition.  This contract provided for the design of the AN/TPQ-53 Radar System and the purchase of four non recurring engineering radars.  Twelve additional radars were purchased under the same contract in response to a directed procurement in July 2008.  The Army Acquisition Executive approved the acquisition of up to 20 radars, of which 17 were procured via letter contract in April 2010.  Three additional radars were procured in August 2011.  On 29 February 2012, the Government competitively awarded a firm fixed price contract for up to 67 AN/TPQ-53 production assets, of which 52 LRIP assets were procured.  The table below provides contract information.   <br>  <br> Contract Number	Award Date	Contractor	Extent Competed/Authority <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	26 Sep 06	Lockheed Martin	Full and open competition <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	25 Jul 08	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	12 Apr 10	Lockheed Martin	Letter Contract; award of 17 systems as part of an undefinitized contract action (UCA)  <br> (FAR 16.302-1) <br> W15P7T-06-C-T004	11 Aug 11	Lockheed Martin	UCA Definitization; award of 3 systems <br> (FAR 16.302-1) <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015	29 Feb 12	Lockheed Martin	Full and open competition <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015	29 Feb 12	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br> W15P7T-12-C-C015	26 Jun 13	Lockheed Martin	Option Award <br> (FAR 17.2) <br>  <br> 4. Description of Contract Action.   The Government anticipates this effort will be performed on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) basis.  The period of performance (PoP) for this effort is up to 36 months. <br>  <br> This effort will require the production of up to 13 LRIP AN/TPQ-53 Radar Systems, acceptance testing and program management support.  The systems shall meet the latest LRIP configuration and the requirements of the AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901), provided as an attachment to this RFI/SSA.  The AN/TPQ-53 Radar Systems produced under this contract must be identical to the AN/TPQ-53 LRIP configuration at the time of contract award, and meet all requirements of the AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901).   <br>  <br> Product Manager Radars does not possess a technical data package (TDP) that will support production and integration of the AN/TPQ-53 Radar System.  The fit, form and function data procured under AN/TPQ-53 contract W15P7T-12-C-C015 was procured to facilitate transition of lifecycle support to organic sources, and to accomplish component breakout for future competitive spares procurement. The Government will not take delivery of this TDP until Fiscal Year (FY) 2016.   <br>  <br> Government acceptance testing will demonstrate that each system is fully compliant with the AN/TPQ-53 Performance Specification (77A582901).

<DESC>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives<br />Statement of Work<br />Peer Responder Program (PRP)
<p>1.0 INDRODUCTION</p>
<p>1.1 Organization</p>
<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has a requirement for a contractor to provide medical oversight, physician certification, and ongoing operational and training support to the Bureau's Peer Responder Program (PRP). The PRP program has 50 employees cross trained as peer responders. They are stationed nationwide. Operational support will be needed anywhere within the United States and its territories. Training support will occur in locations throughout the United States as determined by ATF.</p>
<p>2.0 Background and Objectives</p>
<p>ATFs Special Operations Division (SOD) supports ATFs Field Divisions through a variety of programs including the PRP. The PRP fulfills a vital role. ATFs peer responders must be trained to respond to a variety of situations and assist employees exposed to a critical incident. The response is meant to mitigate the effects of critical incident stress. To accomplish this, ATFs peer responders are trained in the most current version of Psychological First Aid (PFA).</p>
<p>The successful contractor shall provide a psychologist to design, oversee, and implement the aforementioned training classes. Said psychologist shall be licensed in his/her state. In addition, said psychologist should possess evidence of advanced accomplishment in his/her profession such as American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP) and fellow status in the American Psychological Association (APA). Said psychologist should have a successful peer reviewed publication record in topics related to crisis intervention, PFA, peer support, etc. Said psychologist should also have a successful history of designing similar programs for Federal Law Enforcement.</p>
<p>In addition, ATF does require the successful contractor to deploy licensed psychiatrists with its peer responders. These psychiatrists should possess evidence of advanced accomplishment in treating persons with post traumatic stress disorder, depressive disorders and other anxiety disorders. Furthermore said contractor shall show evidence of advanced professional standing by having a successful peer reviewed publication record related to the topics of post traumatic stress disorders, depressive disorders and other anxiety disorders. The successful contractor must be capable of providing deployment support on limited notice.</p>
<p>3.0 Scope of Work</p>
<p>ATF requires the following support:</p>
<p>a) Training</p>
<p>i. The cadre of ATF peer responders consists of ATF employees across all job series. Annually, the contractor will provide instruction for up to two annual refresher training events. Each event will be two days in length. These training events will focus on current practices in Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM), psychological first aid, resistance, resilience, recovery, individual debriefing strategies, group debriefing strategies and family/spousal interactions. The successful contractor shall possess evidence of having designed and implemented training programs in crisis intervention, psychological first aid, human resilience, and CISM. Furthermore said contractor shall show evidence of advanced professional standing by having a successful record of professional publications on the topics of CISM, crisis intervention, psychological first aid, and human resilience. The training will take place at sites to be determined by SOD. The contractor will be responsible for all costs related to securing classroom space. The contractor will be responsible for all supply and student handout (paper) costs. Should SOD request, the contractor will participate in periodic conference calls that include members of the PRP. The agenda for these conference calls include continuing PRP education, discussion of PRP activations and other topics to be determined by SOD. These conference calls will allow ATF peer responders to maintain a readiness to serve the Bureau by engaging in more frequent training. ATF anticipates no more than one (1) conference call per month.</p>
<p>ii. As requested, the contractor will conduct a Peer Responder Basic School. This school will train ATF employees to be peer responders. This school will be up to four days in length as determined by SOD and the contractor. The school site will be determined by SOD. These training events will focus on current practices in CISM, psychological first aid, resistance, resilience, recovery, individual debriefing strategies, group debriefing strategies and family/spousal interactions. The successful contractor shall possess evidence of having designed and implemented training programs in crisis intervention, psychological first aid, human resilience, and CISM. Furthermore said contractor shall show evidence of advanced professional standing by having a successful record of professional publications on the topics of CISM, crisis intervention, psychological first aid, and human resilience. The contractor will be responsible for all costs related to securing classroom space. The contractor will be responsible for all supply and student handout (paper) costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;b) Operations <br /><br />i. Provide licensed psychiatrist to deploy with a PRP team as needed by SOD. This requirement is for up to 10 days annually. If coverage is needed in excess of 10 days, coverage will be billable at a rate of $2,000 per day, per psychiatrist. Travel costs are additional and will be paid per ATF regulations.</p>
<p>4.0 Services</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>a) Provide a state licensed psychiatrist in good standing. These psychiatrists should possess evidence of advanced accomplishment in treating persons with post traumatic stress disorder, depressive disorders and other anxiety disorders. Furthermore said contractor shall show evidence of advanced professional standing by having a successful record of professional publications on the topics of post traumatic stress disorders, depressive disorders and other anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>b) Provide a psychologist to design, oversee, and implement the aforementioned training classes. Said psychologist shall be licensed in his/her state. In addition, said psychologist should possess evidence of advanced accomplishment in his/her profession such as ABPP and fellow status in the American Psychological Association (FAPA). Said psychologist should also have a successful history of designing similar programs for Federal Law Enforcement.</p>
<p>c) Provide a hospital clinical site to support in-person and/or inpatient psychiatric care for ATF employees as needed. ATF anticipates that 10 employees a year would benefit from and require direct face to face psychiatric evaluation. These employees will travel to the hospital site for faculty evaluation. Service includes clinical evaluations, referral and quality assurance/outcome monitoring. Services will be provided by experts in depressive disorders, PTSD and other anxiety disorders. The facility will offer a full continuum of psychiatric care. Service provided will be HIPAA compliant.</p>
<p>d) Submit all personnel who will provide operational support to an ATF background investigation.</p>
<p>e) Provide immediate on-line consultation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for deployed ATF peer responders. ATF anticipates faculty psychiatrist level telephonic clinical consultation would be requested 90 - 120 times per year.</p>
<p>f) Assist deployed peer responders with locating counseling services in the region the deployment is occurring. These counseling services will be for follow up purposes after the peer responders depart the location. Suggested counseling services will be vetted by the successful contractor and suitable for the affected person(s).</p>
<p>g) Provide off-line medical direction in the form of after action conference calls for peer responders. These conference calls will help all ATF peer responders better understand callouts and contribute to future success.</p>
<p>h) Provide on-line pre-deployment consultation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week as necessary to the PRP Project Officer and/or peer responders as needed.</p>
<p>i) Deployment: The contractor will provide a limited amount of field deployment (10 - 15 days) at the request of ATF. The primary function of such a deployed psychiatrist (1 person) would be to coordinate with the other involved medical personnel and/or ATF Peer Responders and to provide triage services.</p>
<p>j) The contractor will coordinate with ATF in the development and monitoring of the program such that quality is assessed, outcomes are monitored and the program is congruent with ATF culture and needs. It is understood that peer support functions will continue to be administered by ATF with the contractor's support and consultation.</p>
<p>5.0 ATF Responsibilities</p>
<p>ATF will provide the following:</p>
<p>a) Provide ATF background investigation for all contractor personnel who will participate in operations or trainings with ATF.</p>
<p>b) Provide ATF credentials for all contractor personnel who pass background investigation. The credentials will clearly designate bearer as part of ATFs Peer Responder Support Team engaged in official ATF duties.</p>
<p>c) Provide Official Passport to those contractor personnel potentially supporting ATF missions that require travel outside of the United States.</p>
<p>6.0 Travel</p>
<p>Occasional out-of-town travel may be required under this contract. Such travel is anticipated to be within the continental United States and is anticipated to be less than a week in duration. All travel will be reimbursed in accordance with the Contractor's GSA Schedule and the Federal Travel Regulations. Additionally, the contractor may occasionally be required to travel locally within the Washington, DC metropolitan area for training or meeting.</p>
<p>7.0 Option Years Deliverables</p>
<p>As medical and psychological research advances, it is vitally important for the contractor to review said research and implement best practices into the PRP training. Therefore, the contractor will do the following each option year:</p>
<p>a) Update Annual Refresher Sessions to reflect best practices as well as operational experiences of PRP cadre.</p>
<p>c) Update the Peer Responder Program Basic School curriculum to reflect best practices as well as operational experience of PRP cadre.</p>
<p>8.0 Place of Performance<br /><br />It is anticipated that ATF employees will require in person evaluation and/or inpatient care provided by the contractor. To ensure employees needing inpatient care have access to the most up to date treatment modalities, the successful contractor will be university medical center based. The university medical center based model will allow the Bureau to benefit from the teaching and research culture inherent in such institutions. To ensure senior ATF management is able to properly monitor and care for those employees requiring such in person or inpatient services, the hospital center must be within 70 miles of ATF Headquarters. This will allow more efficient and cost effective management of the PRP.</p>
<p>9.0 Period of Performance</p>
<p>Base Year: March 29, 2014 through March 28, 2015<br />Option Year One: March 29, 2015 through March 28, 2016<br />Option Year Two: March 29, 2016 through March 28, 2017<br />Option Year Three: March 29, 2017 through March 28, 2018<br />Option Year Four: March 29, 2018 through March 28, 2019</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>THIS SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  ALL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541711 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.</p>
<p><strong>Description </strong></p>
<p>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.</p>
<p>Developing and testing new vaccines and therapies have historically been a major focus of the research supported by the DMID.  Much of this research is devoted to addressing critical public health needs, such as those related to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g., avian influenza and West Nile Virus), as well as those supporting the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).  In order to ensure that the development, testing and manufacture of products evaluated under DMID-supported clinical research are executed with a rigor that will support licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DMID supports an infrastructure to provide regulatory assistance in the development and testing of these products.</p>
<p>Currently, DMID sponsors approximately 100 Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) or Master Files (MFs) which span more than 200 clinical trials.  This includes both multicenter trials and single center studies, and encompasses Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials performed at both domestic and foreign sites.  DMID files approximately 10-20 new INDs each year, and in this capacity, serves as the official IND sponsor and liaisons with the FDA with respect to all regulatory requirements.  Currently, the DMID IND portfolio is comprised of approximately 75% vaccine and other biologic (monoclonal) INDs, 20% drug INDs, and 5% MFs.  DMID is also the sponsor of an open Investigational Device Exemption application (IDE) and supports interaction with the FDA for studies that support 501(k) filings.<br />The purpose of this anticipated solicitation is to provide scientific, regulatory, technical, project management, and administrative assistance for a broad spectrum of DMID research activities poised for regulatory approval or licensure.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance: </strong></p>
<p>It is anticipated that a single cost-reimbursement, Level of Effort type contract will be awarded with a one-year base period of performance beginning in or around July 2015 and the inclusion of 6 one-year Option Periods.

<CONTACT>WANDA M. HOLLIDAY, Contract Specialist, Phone 919-541-0943, Fax 919-541-5117, Email hollida1@niehs.nih.gov - Juanita A Campbell, Contracting Officer, Fax 301-451-5400, Email campbellj@niehs.nih.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Small Business Sources Sought Notice</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>QUALITY ASSESSMENT SUPPORT FOR CONDUCT OF AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS FOR<br />THE NATIONAL TOXICOLOGY PROGRAM (NTP)</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice.</strong> This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span></strong>The National Toxicology Program (NTP; part of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS) is responsible for evaluating the toxic and carcinogenic potential of environmental agents that may pose a health hazard to citizens of the United States. The NTP accomplishes this by conducting toxicology and carcinogenicity studies on a variety of chemical, physical and biological agents as well as analyses of literature data. The NTP requires quality assessment support to aid the NTP in managing the overall quality of NTP studies, data and reports. <br /><br />Quality assessment support work is currently being conducted under contract N01-ES-45517 held by Dynamac Corporation. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives<br /></span></strong>The purpose of the NTP Quality Assessment support contract is to conduct audits and inspections of various aspects of NTP studies in order to identify areas in the conduct and documentation of studies that merit attention, correction or improvement. Findings from these audits and inspections will be communicated to NTP staff and management so they may be addressed; this process will aid the NTP in managing the overall quality of NTP studies, data and reports. The NTP requires support for the conduct of audits of NTP reports, laboratory reports, pathology tables, and electronic information as well as site visit support for monitoring work in progress at contract toxicology laboratories.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project requirements<br /></span></strong>Quality assessment audits/inspections shall be assigned by the NTP Contract Officer's Representative (COR) based on NTP priorities. Note that the distribution and total number of audits/inspections may vary from year to year depending on the needs of the NTP. The different types of audits/inspections to be conducted under the contract are briefly described below. <br /><br />The toxicology and carcinogenesis studies and ancillary activities that will comprise the majority of the audits/inspections to be performed under the contract involve primarily the disciplines of chemistry, animal care, toxicology and pathology. The following types of procedures, records, data and results are anticipated to require audit/inspection: chemistry (identity, purity, homogeneity and stability; dose formulation/preparation, analysis, and stability; biological sample collection/analysis); inhalation exposure generation and monitoring; animal husbandry (receipt, quarantine, randomization, and environmental conditions); in life toxicity (clinical observations, body weights); functional reproductive, immunological and neurological effects; biochemical and molecular endpoints; genetic toxicity data; gross and histopathology data; teratology data; procedures used to capture and process data; data trails; statistical analysis data; in vitro evaluations.<br /><br />&bull; Audit of an NTP Report: Assesses the accuracy, consistency and completeness of the factual information, qualitative and quantitative, presented in an NTP Report by comparing it to original study records submitted to the NTP. For most types of data, a 100% audit is required. As an exception, a partial audit of large data sets is typically conducted, with findings potentially triggering a more extensive (up to 100%) audit.</p>
<p>&bull; Audit of a Laboratory Report: Assesses the accuracy, consistency and completeness of the factual information, qualitative and quantitative, presented in a laboratory report by comparing it to original study records submitted to the NTP. For most types of data, a 100% audit is required. As an exception, a partial audit of large data sets is typically conducted, with findings potentially triggering a more extensive (up to 100%) audit.</p>
<p>&bull; Audit of Pathology Tables: Assesses the accuracy and completeness of all of the NTP-authorized diagnostic changes made during the peer review process by auditing the post-peer review laboratory information management system individual animal pathology tables against the peer review documentation. In addition, the diagnoses for a subset (currently 5%) of the animals for which no update was indicated shall be audited, by comparing pre-peer review tables to post-peer review tables, to ensure the overall data continuity and stability of unchanged diagnoses.</p>
<p>&bull; Audit of Electronic Information: Assesses the overall quality of electronic information (NTP public website or related websites) either by comparing the electronically available information to original study records or other primary sources or by comparing information in two or more electronic sources to determine consistency of factual information.</p>
<p>&bull; Site-visit support for monitoring work in progress at Contract Toxicology Laboratories: The contractor shall accompany NTP staff (including the NTP COR) on quality assessment site visits to assess the extent to which study conduct complies with relevant contractual standards, including the NTP Specifications and Federal Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. Quality assessment site visits shall typically include inspections of study procedures as they are being performed, inspections of equipment and facilities, and audits of data for studies that are in progress.<br /><br />Specific details about the design, conduct and reporting of NTP studies can be found in the current Specifications for the Conduct of Studies to Evaluate the Toxic and Carcinogenic Potential of Chemical, Biological and Physical Agents in Laboratory Animals for the National Toxicology Program (http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/Test_Info/FinalNTP_ToxCarSpecsJan2011.pdf) and the current Specifications for the Conduct of Studies to Evaluate the Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity of Chemical, Biological and Physical Agents in Laboratory Animals for the National Toxicology Program (http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/Test_Info/FinalNTP_ReproSpecsMay2011_508.pdf). <br /><br />Specifications are not currently available for other types of studies/endpoints reported by the NTP; however, additional information on these types of studies/endpoints will be provided to the quality assessment support Contractor as necessary. In addition, examples of recent NTP reports can be found on the NTP public website (http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/pubs).</p>
<p>The principal investigator shall be an employee of the contractor, shall be considered key personnel and shall manage all aspects of the contract. Because there is potential for conflict of interest, personnel assigned to this contract, as well as subcontractors or consultants, shall not be in any way associated with NTP testing contracts that have performed the work being audited. Audits of NTP reports and laboratory reports require access to study records that are stored at the NTP archives. Accordingly much of work done under this contract will be performed at the NTP archives. In addition, the contractor will pick up/drop off audit materials at the NTP COR's office, as well as meet with the NTP COR and other NTP staff as appropriate. Both the NTP and the NTP archives are currently located in Research Triangle Park, NC) and frequent (weekly to daily) travel to these locations will be required. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated level of effort and period of performance<br /></span></strong>Award of a cost-reimbursement, level of effort type contract is contemplated. The total estimated level of effort is anticipated to be between approximately 5,000 and 10,000 labor hours per year, including options, depending on the needs of the NTP. <br /><br />The Base Contract is anticipated from September 1, 2014 to August 31, 2015 with nine optional one-year periods of performance. If all options are exercised the period of performance shall extend through August 31, 2023. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other important considerations<br /></span></strong>Electronic documents and reports are anticipated to be included in the deliverables of the resultant contract. When acquiring Electronic and Information Technology (EIT), the government is obligated to meet the accessibility standards at 36 CFR Part 1194 and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

<DESC>Avionic Intermittent Fault Detector
<p>Background</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals, there is no solicitation package available and no contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst is seeking information from industry that will assist in the assessment of new technology for the purpose of detecting intermittent faults in avionics. This information will assist the NAWCAD in determining an acquisition strategy for a Joint Intermittence Tester (JIT).</p>
<p>The Department of Defense aviation communities require a Joint Intermittence Tester (JIT) to detect intermittent faults in Weapons Replaceable Assemblies (WRA)/Line Replaceable Assemblies (LRU). These faults are sometimes referred to as: No Fault Found (NFF), Can Not Duplicate (CND), No Evidence of Failure (NEOF) and Nothing to Report (NTF). Intermittent avionic chassis faults have been identified as a major cost and operational degrader for all US armed forces aviation platforms.</p>
<p>Request for Information:</p>
<p>The NAWCADLKE is seeking information from industry regarding avionic intermittent fault detection technology. Please provide the following information in your response:</p>
<p>1) General description of your avionic intermittent fault detection product / technology.</p>
<p>2) Identification of critical enabling technologies of your avionic intermittent fault detection JIT. Include technology readiness level (TRL) of your JIT product / technology and a summary of field usage, test and demonstration results. Describe, if applicable, any additional stimuli that must be applied to the unit under test (e.g. physical manipulation to induce faults, etc.).</p>
<p>3) Overview of your JIT concept of operation (including user operating manual if available). Discuss the operator - JIT interface, JIT - WRA/LRU interface and any related issues. Discuss anticipated and demonstrated benefit versus cost of utilization of your JIT and any demonstrated Return on Investment (ROI).</p>
<p>4) Discuss critical information required for the use of your JIT (e.g. lengths and types of wires, chassis schematics; etc.)</p>
<p>5) Discuss fault detection reliability, including types of detectable faults and minimum fault durations, and fault isolation accuracy.</p>
<p>6) Describe environmental testing test methods and results that your JIT has been subjected to. Discuss environmental conditions in which the JIT is approved to operate (e.g., electromagnetic susceptibility or emissions, operating / storage temperature, humidity, altitude, and shock.) Please provide a detailed description of any explosive atmosphere testing.</p>
<p>7) If applicable, provide customer testimonials with references. Provide your point(s) of contact.</p>
<p>8) Provide information about your company /organization including a brief description of your company /organization; Small / large business, 8A, hub-zone, veteran-owned status; and any past or present Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) awards related to your JIT.</p>
<p>9) Provide any additional information you desire.</p>
<p>General Guidelines</p>
<p>How to Respond: Responses to this RFI should be submitted via email to Keith Welge at keith.welge@navy.mil, no later than 45 days from the date of this posting.</p>
<p>The Government may elect not to discuss submissions received in response to this RFI with individual responders.</p>
<p>There is no requirement to respond to the RFI in order to be eligible to propose on the planned RFP. However, the Government places tremendous value on the information received and may utilize it to finalize its acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e) responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract/agreement.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Any information submitted by respondents in response to this request for information is strictly voluntary. This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor does its issuance restrict the Government to any ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that may be submitted by respondents to this RFI.

The purpose of this RFI is to gather market research to assist NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) in acquiring a ship maintenance planning solution for the Management Systems Support Division (MSSD) in support of the Submarine Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SUBMEPP), the Surface Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SURFMEPP) and the Carrier Planning Activity (CPA).

The US Navy is seeking to implement a solution that will provide the capabilities to support ship/platform maintenance planning. The US Navys maintenance requirements are expected to grow and change over time, as new ship platforms are brought into the inventory and old platforms are retired. The US Navy intends to acquire a solution that will support efforts to update and modernize the current maintenance planning tool.

The requirements for the ship maintenance planning solution are attached.  The requirements and Attachments A and B are combined in one file.
 Attachment C is a separate excel file.The information provided in response to this RFI shall include the following:

	Company profile/information (All information required in the attached documents)
	Completed Attachments B and C

Questions should be submitted, in writing, to Lauren Johnson via e-mail at lauren.johnson@navy.mil by 4 pm EST 10 January 2013.

<DESC>The Walla Walla District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is planning to have test done on the passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from several manufactures.  The PIT tags are needed for research purposes associated with the Northwestern Division's Anadromous Fish Evaluation Program.  A PIT tag is classified as a sonar reading tag under the Standard Industrial Code #3812 and is subject to radio frequency licensing.  The PIT tags needed are glass-encapsulated electronic devices measuring approximately 12-12.5 mm long by 2.0- 2.1 mm in diameter.  The tag can be coded with one of 35 billion unique codes.  As PIT-tagged fish migrate through the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS), they pass though electronic interrogation coils at detection sites located at federal dams in the Columbia River Basin and its tributaries.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island intends to award contract W52P1J-14-D-0012 for the extension of Bremerhaven Container Repair Services currently provided under expiring contract W912CM-10-D-0003.  The proposed action is to issue a contract for six months from 1 December 2013 to 31 May 2014 in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The extension is necessary to ensure continuation of services and to avoid disruption of critical services.  A competitive follow-on action will not be executed for this requirement.  Rather, the Container Repair Services function will be met organically.  The Government is currently working to position the proper assets required to adequately support the mission and this bridge contract will ensure continuity of services in the interim.  Not awarding this extension would cause serious harm to the Government.  However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the date and time identified.  Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement in the timeframe required.  Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source extension described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of Derek M. Schnorrenberg, Procuring Contracting Officer.  Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to Mr. Justin Lockett at justin.e.lockett2.civ@mail.mil or Mr. Derek M.

<SUBJECT>14--Request for Information for the Lethal Miniature Aerial Munition System (LMAMS)
<SOLNBR>W31P4Q14R0043
<ARCHDATE>02052014
<CONTACT>Kimberly Garrett, 256-313-4852

<a href="mailto:kimberly.a.garrett@us.army.mil">ACC-RSA - (Missile)</a>
<DESC>This request for information (RFI) seeks to expand on the information received through the previous RFI for the LMAMS system released on August 15, 2012.  This RFI is subject to the provisions of FAR 52.215-3 and is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of a contractor's submission of responses to this announcement; or the Government's use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  The information provided may be used by the Government in further developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications.  Response to this RFI is restricted to US Department of Defense contractors only. <br>  <br> Non-United States companies or any United States subsidiaries of a non-US owned company shall be restricted from participation as prime, sub-contractors or component vendors if their participation includes any level of access to classified information with regards to warheads, electronic safe and arm devices, SAASM global positioning system, or any form of National Security Agency encrypted algorithm data link.  Access restrictions included but are not limited to: system, subsystem or component designs and specifications; interface control documents; system or component drawings; manufacturing technology, materials, components; quality control and software development, integration, testing and documentation. <br>  <br> The LMAMS is envisioned to be a loitering precision guided system, organic at the small unit level, which allows unprecedented engagement of enemy combatants without exposing the Warfighter to direct enemy fires.  Notional LMAMS system components may consist of:  1) Fire control unit (providing hardware and/or function such as data link, associated cables, operator interface, and mission preparation and execution functions),;  2) an all-up-round munition (includes airframe, sensors, integrated guidance (such as Inertial Navigation System and/or Autopilot), warhead, data link, and launcher),; and 3) a training simulator.   A notional LMAMS fire control unit is day/night readable, providing the user real time video and control of the munition.  The operator can select predetermined targets using geo location reference, visually select and identify targets of opportunity, loiter, abort, abort and redirect, arm/disarm, and manually command warhead detonation.  <br>  <br> Three distinct mission phases are mission preparation, fly out, and terminal engagement.  All phases of the LMAMS operations must be accomplished by a single operator and configurable for dismounted or mounted patrolling operations.  For mission preparation purposes, targeting information is provided to or by the operator and may consist of headings, geo location reference, or landmark information provided by direct observation from the operator, other observers, or by sensors and networks separate from LMAMS. Positive identification of the target shall be made prior to launch by these sources.  The operator will use this information to perform mission preparation with the fire control unit allowing autonomous flight to the area of interest.  For the fly out, LMAMS must be launched quickly and fly an assigned route or path to a target area by a single operator.  LMAMS will be capable of loitering.  In the terminal engagement phase, LMAMS will have the ability to automatically track a target designated by the operator or allow the operator to manually control the system as needed to focus on a specific area or point of interest.  The system must have lethal effects against personnel and personnel in moving light-duty vehicles, while minimizing collateral damage.  LMAMS must have the ability to automatically lock on and track a stationary or moving target.  Once a target is selected by the operator in the terminal phase of an engagement no further operator input shall be required. <br>  <br> The Army LMAMS notional acquisition approach will respond to an approved Capabilities Production Document (CPD) (the basis for the System Performance Specification (SPS)) formal requirement employing a competitive prototype down select decision (for two or more sources) in late FY15/early FY16; therefore the Army is seeking component/technology readiness levels of 7+ that meet criteria for entry into the acquisition system at the production phase for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP 1) (Milestone C).  The competitive down select decision would be made in conjunction with a Milestone decision review based upon proposal evaluation and hardware/flight demonstration results.  Bidders will be expected to demonstrate existing system capabilities and submit written proposals for any necessary hardware/software design updates to achieve the results required by the SPS and the implementing contracts.  A subsequent competitive follow-on production contract decision is planned between the previously competitively selected sources.  This RFI provides the following additional LMAMS system information/documentation: 1) Draft System Technical Requirements (STR), 2) Draft Notional Program Schedule, and 3) Draft Scope of Work for the LRIP 1 contract and available referenced attachments, and 4) Draft Hardware Demonstration Requirements as part of a future proposal response.  These documents will be available in an electronic reading room. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is developing component technologies in support of LMAMS under the Small Organic Precision Munition (SOPM) Program.  Component technologies under development include Image Stabilization and Autotracker; Secure Digital Data Link; Power Systems; Small warheads; Laser Height of Burst Sensor; and Electronic Safe and Arm Device (ESAD).  Information regarding these component technologies will also be available in the electronic reading room.  <br>  <br> Vendors who access the LMAMS RFI Reading Room will be required to possess either a DoD CAC Card or a DoD PKI ECA Certificate issued from an approved authority.  Per AKO, the software certificates listed below are the only ones that can be registered at this time with AKO.  Links to the vendor sites and more information about the DISA's ECA PKI Program can be found on their website at http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html.  For access to the reading room, please email Brandon Williams, brandon.m.williams2.civ@mail.mil   or Steve Horn, steven.e.horn4.civ@mail.mil.  You will be granted access to the reading room front page, where you will find a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).  Please print, scan and email the NDA to Mr. Williams and Mr. Horn.  You will then be granted access to documents located in the reading room.  The reading room will be located on AKO with the direct URL https://www.us.army.mil/suite/files/40357720. <br>  <br> The following information is requested:  <br> 1.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT - Commander Navy Installations Command (CNIC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Athletes Performance Institute 2620 E Rose Garden Lane Ste 1, Phoenix, AZ. 85050, developer of the Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System (NOFFS), for the purchase of the following: Support and Maintenance services for Navy Operational Fitness and Fueling System (NOFFS) as per the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). CNIC will be purchasing this requirement with NON-APPROPRIATED FUNDS (NAF). The contract will result in a NAF firm fixed price contract. Negotiation is being conducted using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to authority of CNICINST 7043.1. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of CNICINST 7043.1 paragraph 209 as shown below. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in preparation of proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any responses to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to Dennis Bertrand, dennis.bertrand@navy.mil, no later than 20 November 2013, 12:00 PM CST.
<p>209. Single Source of Supply. This situation exists when required products can only be obtained from one source, or when it is impracticable to obtain competition. "Single source" contracting is rarely justifiable. If similar items of different manufacture are unacceptable for any reason, it is<br />generally practicable to obtain price competition by soliciting the preferred manufacturer, their distributors and dealers, and considering government sources as well. The requestor must provide a written, single source justification with the purchase request that states what critical or unique features of the requirement limits its availability to a single source. The justification should also explain why other sources are not acceptable. The contracting office makes the final<br />determination on all single source purchase requests, and documentation is required in the contract file for actions taken and price evaluation.</p>

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		8540-00-965-5790<br />Name:		Cover, Toilet Seat, Disposable, Paper, Quarter-Folded<br />Description:	14-3/4" W x 17-1/4" L, white, disposable, tissue paper toilet seat cover with a tear-out center. Quarter-folded to 7" wide and 10" long for use in toilet seat cover dispenser NSN 4510-01- 327-9405. UOI is PG. PG = One (1) sleeve of 200 seat covers.</p>
<p>NSN:		8540-00-NIB-0060<br />Name:		Cover, Toilet Seat, Disposable, Paper, Half-Folded<br />Description:	14-3/4" W x 17-1/4" L, white, disposable, tissue paper toilet seat cover with a tear-out center. Half-folded to 7" wide and 8.5" long for use in industry standard half-fold toilet seat cover dispensers. UOI is BX. BX = Twenty (20) sleeves of 250 seat covers.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			8540-00-965-5790<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	8540009655790; GUNP816; 2VEX5</p>
<p>NSN:			8540-00-NIB-0060<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	826724; HG-5000; HOSHG5000CT; HG5000CT; 659-K5000</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 22, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>The Soliciation 11-JC-REG2-WOOD, for the operation of the Woodland Job Corps Center is&nbsp;cancelled.&nbsp; <br /><br /></strong>The soliciation 11-JC-REG2-WOOD was initially released on June 1, 2011. An award was made in September of 2012 and the award decision was subsequently protested. <br /><br />The U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration (ETA), Office of Job Corps still possesses a requirement for the operation of the Woodland Job Corps center.&nbsp; Thus, ETA is now in the process of re-conducting market reserach and will ultimately re-issue a solicition for these services.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) <br>  <br> 1.  Introduction:  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training & Instrumentation <br>  (PEO STRI) is conducting market research to provide Virtual Brigade Combat Team (VBCT) Collective training, to support the future needs of the Army.  Sources are sought that leverage existing investments and provide opportunities for early refinement of emerging platforms.  This Request For Information (RFI) is intended to shape emerging requirements, inform technology and affordability bounds to the solution space and shape an adaptive acquisition strategy for Army solutions.  Part of the market research is to publish a RFI Notice seeking market information on businesses able to provide the capabilities, as described in the below sections.    <br>  <br> This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Your response to this notice is strictly voluntary and will be treated as information only.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this notice or the Government use of such information.  This RFI Notice is not tied to any current nor anticipated to be a precursor to any future request for proposals (RFP).  Sources will be provided the opportunity to present briefings or demonstrations to a Government panel during Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) on Tuesday, 3 December 2013 in Government MeetingRoom (S330D) after the overview briefing scheduled for 0800..   <br>  <br> 2.  Overview:  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Program Executive Office Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is seeking industry solutions to provide collective training at a high level of fidelity for the Company Combat Team mission set of the Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT), and the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) in a virtual environment that is interoperable with the Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) solution in CCTT.  The VBCT solution must be compatible and interoperable with the Synthetic Environment (SE-Core) terrain databases, the Live, Virtual Constructive - Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), Games for Training (GFT), Stryker Embedded Training System (ETS) and stimulate/be stimulated by mission command systems.  Ideally, the VBCT should be low overhead, mobile, rapidly reconfigurable, approximate the conditions of the operational environment, operate on the Army's training network and contain an automated training management capability. <br>  <br> 	a.  For the SBCT, a fully immersive, or a combination of fully and semi-immersive training simulation for two company-sized elements or a Brigade Tactical Exercise without Troops (TEWT).

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Safety Lancets, Pediatric. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Safety Lancets, Pediatric products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Safety Lancets, Pediatric. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Safety Lancets, Pediatric will be established approximately April 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately May 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Safety Lancets, Pediatric. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Safety Lancets, Pediatric.</p>
<p><strong>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br /></strong>The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Safety Lancets, Pediatric. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $402,275.33. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Fifteen distinct Safety Lancet, Pediatric products represent five product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of the five product groups, one represents the clinically significant product group for the QSL. Of those five groups, one item is considered the requirement for Standardization and accounts for 89.46% ($359,900) of the total volume in sales ($402,275). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p><strong>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below.</strong> The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL",<strong> vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. </strong>Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br /></strong>The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br /></strong>Safety Lancets, Pediatric requirements are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification.<strong> A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

<p>These Pregnancy Test Devices products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Pregnancy Test Devices. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Pregnancy Test Devices will be established approximately April 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately May 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Pregnancy Test Devices. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Pregnancy Test Devices.</p>
<p><strong>A. Products &amp; Performance Required.<br /></strong>The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Pregnancy Test Devices. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,606,427.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Five product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of the five product groups, two represent the clinically significant product groups, are considered the minimum requirement for the addition to the QSL, and account for 99.6% of the total volume in sales ($1,606,427.00). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p><strong>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below</strong>. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></p>
<p><strong>C. Source Selection Procedures<br /></strong>The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Disinfectant Surface Wipes. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MN-1201-20_Disinfectant_Surface_Wipes are eligible for participation. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These <strong>Disinfectant Surface Wipes</strong> products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This RFIAQ is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL <strong>MN-1201-20_Disinfectant_Surface_Wipes</strong>. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from DAPA prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is January 2014. Among vendors who are on the QSL MN-1201-20_Disinfectant_Surface_Wipes, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Disinfectant Surface Wipes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br /></strong>The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Disinfectant Surface Wipes. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $1,945,707.11 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below.</p>
<p><strong>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors on the QSL MN-1201-20_Disinfectant_Surface_Wipes who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to the FBO Sources Sought notification via e-mail to the POCs below.</strong> The vendor's responses will include detailed information requested in the requirements listed in the FBO Sources Sought notification and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that the submission and quote were received by the MMESO North via e-mail, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendor must complete and submit the FBO Package Worksheet. </strong>A vendor who cannot open the FBO Package Worksheet may contact the POC as noted in the FBO Sources Sought notification and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy).<strong> Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing, per the FBO Sources Sought notification, will not be eligible for participation in the Standardization Action for an Incentive Agreement.</strong></p>
<p><strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br /></strong>Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MHS.</strong> The MMESO North DSL reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br /><strong>Vendor Instructions for Pricing Submission<br /></strong>Disinfectant Surface Wipes pricing requirements are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in the FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the IA. Vendor's pricing and packages MUST match those that were submitted as a response to the QSL FBO MN-1201-20_Disinfectant_Surface_Wipes.</strong> Vendor must provide responses to the RFIAQ via the FBO Package Worksheet. Use these instructions to complete the FBO Package Worksheet. Vendors who are not selected will be notified in writing upon issuance of an IA.</p>
<p><strong>1. Vendor must provide pricing for the following items listed in response to the SA FBO posting.</strong> Vendor must submit the following information via IA FBO Package Worksheet for each QSL required item: Vendor Part Number (PN), Manufacturer PN, Manufacturer Name, Full Item Description, DAPA Number for Item, Unit of Measure (UOM), Quantity (QTY) in UOM, Unit of Inner Packaging (UOP), QTY of UOM in UOP, Unit of Sale (UOS), QTY of UOM in UOS, UOS Base Price, UOS Incentive Price, UOM Base Price and UOM Incentive Price. Vendors are required to supply pricing for all items listed in the table below, as qualified on the QSL.</p>
<p><strong>Item Descriptions /&nbsp;Annual Usage in Units (Individual Wipes)<br /></strong>DISINFECTANT SURFACE WIPE SIZE RANGE 5 IN TO 7 IN X 5.75 IN TO 10 IN WITH A MINIMUM OF 100 WIPES PER CONTAINER WITH A TURBERCULOCIDAL CLAIM /&nbsp;38660400</p>
<p>2. Vendor may provide any or all of the additional items listed below, following the same format as for requirement number 1. Pricing for these additional items will not be part of the pricing computation for vendor selection. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Item Descriptions <br /></strong>DISINFECTANT SURFACE WIPE SIZE RANGE LARGER THAN 5 IN TO 7 IN X 5.75 IN TO 10 IN WITH A MINIMUM OF 50 WIPES PER CONTAINER WITH A TURBERCULOCIDAL CLAIM</p>
<p>3. Vendor will be required to submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by the terms of the DAPA to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the SA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE CLAUSES:</p>
<p>PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENT TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (AUGUST 2012) (DEVIATION)<br />This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012.</p>
<p>(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor.</p>
<p>(b) Include the substance of this clause, including paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.</p>
<p>(c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />1352.201-70, CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (APRIL 2010) <br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity. (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall: (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications. (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>(a) Prohibitions. <br />Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. <br />(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: <br />Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.<br />Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. <br />Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- <br />(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; <br />(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- <br />(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or <br />(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and <br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. <br />Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs <br />(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. <br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: <br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or <br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). <br />(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. <br />(3) Certain transfers disregarded.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future awards consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide repair manuals or OEM repair data. In their quote, vendors must provide a reference to the current OEM Manual or Service Reference (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789") that will be used in the repair or overhaul as applicable. Quote must include Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and FOB Point. The HC-144A Aircraft OEM is EADS CONSTRUCCIONES AERONAUTICASS.A. DBA EADS CASA, AV. DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B, and their domestic repair facility Cage Code is 0DAF1. Any TT&amp;E plus average repair cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical repair cost. This is AN UNRESTRICTED SOLICITATION. NAICS Code 488190 is applicable. This solicitation is for the repair of HC-144 Aircraft Component/Part(s):

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Phillip.A.Will@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 09DEC13 0830 Pacific Time.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed. In addition to DRM, PS, and OPS, OFDA has a Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>DCHA/OFDA provides non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  The Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team (HPGE) serves as the principal focal point for humanitarian policy development, engagement and institutional relationships with international organizations and other donor governments.  HPGE tracks trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field; engages in policy discussion with other donors and multilateral agencies; recommends strategies for action to DCHA; initiates policy and internal guidance for the organization; maintains global relationships with implementing partners; leads OFDA's communications and social media outreach; and serves as the primary interlocutor on strategic issues with OFDA's other federal partners on global issues.</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Policy Team Leader position serves as an integral part of the HPGE team and closely coordinates with other parts of the U.S. Government (USG) community on humanitarian issues.  The position assists in planning DCHA strategies and responses to humanitarian crises; advocates and educates on humanitarian issues; provides guidance on policy issues; prepares key briefings and guidance; and manages the policy team.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.  In addition to DRM, PS, and OPS, OFDA has a Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>DCHA/OFDA provides non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  The Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team (HPGE) serves as the principal focal point for humanitarian policy development, engagement and institutional relationships with international organizations and other donor governments.  HPGE tracks trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field; engages in policy discussion with other donors and multilateral agencies; recommends strategies for action to DCHA; initiates policy and internal guidance for the organization; maintains global relationships with implementing partners; leads OFDA's communications and social media outreach; and serves as the primary interlocutor on strategic issues with OFDA's other federal partners on global issues.</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Policy Advisor position is part of the Humanitarian Policy Team, serving as an integral part of the HPGE team and closely coordinates with other parts of the U.S. Government community on humanitarian issues.  The position assists in planning DCHA strategies and responses to humanitarian crises; advocates and educates on humanitarian issues; provides guidance on policy issues; prepares key briefings and guidance; and manages the policy team.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of multiple Humanitarian Policy Advisors in order to meet its objectives of programming, coordinating with other donors, and situational analysis on humanitarian policy issues and developing policy guidance.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Policy Advisor is part of a humanitarian policy team that provides critical analysis on humanitarian policy issues, works closely with high-ranking officials within the international community, and serves as a key source of information on humanitarian issues and humanitarian policy for the office.  He/She will help plan organizational strategies and responses to humanitarian crises, actively work with members of UN delegations on U.S. positions on humanitarian issues, provide effective liaisons with the UN offices in Geneva, Rome and New York, and anticipate and prepare documents and briefing memos on humanitarian issues for important meetings and events.  The Humanitarian Policy Advisor will also raise critical issues with the UN on behalf of OFDA, DCHA offices and other U.S. Government (USG) agencies and must have the ability to multi-task.  The assignment involves providing expert analytical and advisory support on humanitarian issues for the planning, development and execution of U.S. foreign policy within a broad and complex geographic or functional specialty area.  The work requires applying a rigorous analytical approach to data and the Humanitarian Policy Advisor will receive general guidance but will be expected to execute independent judgment and analysis.</p>
<p>Contacts will be within the USG, as well as personnel at U.S. posts worldwide, senior analysts and officials in UN and other agencies, experts, and representatives of NGOs.  The role requires significant interaction with foreign delegates, demanding strong diplomatic and communication skills to accurately represent U.S. positions in a complex multilateral setting, based on guidance from Washington.  Contacts occur in a wide variety of planned and unplanned, formal and informal settings, including open meetings, conferences, and negotiating sessions, where the Humanitarian Policy Advisor may be called upon to explain and defend U.S. positions on humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>The position requires extensive experience with, and a thorough understanding of, the international humanitarian assistance environment, operations, related policies, regulations, and inter-relationships among the USG, donor and other international organizations.  Detailed knowledge of humanitarian policy issues such as internal displacement, disaster risk reduction, humanitarian principles and other related topics is required.</p>
<p>The Humanitarian Policy Advisor's duties and responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	As part of a humanitarian policy team, identify, research, analyze and develop recommendations on all issues and matters relating to humanitarian affairs and anticipate the need for such policy analysis.<br />&bull;	Represent USAID at donor meetings covering a broad range of humanitarian issues and provide DCHA with analysis and guidance on relations with the UN system.<br />&bull;	As part of a senior policy team working on humanitarian issues in OFDA's Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team, interact with Department of State colleagues on developing strategies and policies toward UN agencies and humanitarian issues.<br />&bull;	Anticipate the needs of the organization regarding developments in the areas of humanitarian affairs and prepare analyses, briefings, documents and meetings as required.<br />&bull;	Attend various NGO, UN, UN Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) Donor Support Group (ODSG), and other meetings and provide authoritative information and views to formulate humanitarian policies and coordinate strategies on policy issues.<br />&bull;	Initiate and maintain strong working relationships with other donor countries in order to promote humanitarian principles and coordinate disaster response activities.<br />&bull;	Develop and maintain cooperative working relationships with other relevant USG offices and serve as an expert point of contact for these groups in the area of humanitarian affairs. The incumbent will influence policy.<br />&bull;	Represent DCHA on specific humanitarian issues of concern with IOs and NGOs and convey demarche messages as needed.<br />&bull;	Represent USAID at meetings with the UN, IOs, and other donors and at other conferences sponsored by members of the international community; provide expert guidance and advice on USG positions, negotiating strategies, and, in consultation with USAID/Washington, conduct negotiations with the donor community and make recommendations to the appropriate officials in USAID.<br />&bull;	Work with counterparts in other donor organizations at the most senior levels to exchange information, establish meetings on specific donor issues, solicit publications, and collect information on training opportunities; coordinate these activities with relevant USAID officers.<br />&bull;	Advise USAID/OFDA staff on issues regarding donations and requests for USG support and information sharing from private and public interest groups, including those formed on an ad hoc basis during disaster assistance operations.<br />&bull;	Sign-up for and serve as needed, on Washington-based RMTs, which provides services and support to DARTs deployed in response to disasters.  The duties on RMTs will be varied.<br />&bull;	Serve as the OFDA after-hours duty officer on a rotational basis, for approximately one week every six months.<br />&bull;	As needed, serve on DARTs which may require immediate (within 24 hours) deployment overseas for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP<br />The incumbent will take direction from and report to the Humanitarian Policy Team Leader or his/her designee, which is part of the Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS<br />Supervisor provides administrative directions in terms of broadly defined missions or functions.  Employee independently plans, designs and carries out programs, projects, studies or other work.  Results are considered authoritative and are normally accepted without significant change.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to the complex emergency in Sudan, OFDA operates an office headquartered at the USAID Mission in Khartoum, Sudan, which is responsible for overseeing more than $80 million OFDA funding in Sudan during fiscal year 2013.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor (SHA) is OFDA's principal humanitarian representative in Sudan and is located in Khartoum.  The Senior Program Officer (SPO) for Sudan supports the SHA by providing program strategy development and implementation oversight.  The SPO oversees field monitoring of OFDA programs and ensures reporting on humanitarian needs and programming in Sudan, to include Darfur, the Three Areas, the East and country-wide issues.  The SPO assists the SHA with assessment, analysis and reporting on existing or evolving crises, maintenance of partner relationships, and coordination of award management activities.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the SHA, the SPO will coordinate closely with USAID Mission and Embassy staff and exchange information regularly with colleagues covering the South Sudan portfolio, as well as with the field and headquarters-based OFDA regional team.  This includes sharing project ideas, strategies, and soliciting advice and guidance. The SPO will also work closely with the Agreement Officer's Representative for all assigned awards.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of one SPO for the Sudan portfolio to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, risk reduction, resilience programming, strategic reporting, and interagency coordination for the region, are met.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OFDA SPO will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of OFDA programming for humanitarian emergency and disaster risk reduction activities throughout Sudan.  The SPO may assist in humanitarian assistance activities elsewhere in the region as needed.</p>
<p>This position requires effective daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices, Embassy staff, and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.  The SPO must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. government disaster assessment team, DART, RMT, or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.</p>
<p>The Senior Program Officer's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as the principal contact point for OFDA programming in Sudan, which includes the Three Areas, the East and Darfur.  Coordinate closely with both field and headquarters-based components of OFDA's Regional Team and maintain regular contact with concerned staff in both the Khartoum and Juba USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>&bull;	Lead OFDA's Sudan-based program staff in the development of OFDA's programming for response and disaster risk reduction activities in Sudan, ensure complementarity between the two strategies, and oversee implementation of each.</p>
<p>&bull;	Continually assess emergency response and disaster risk reduction needs in Sudan in order to ensure that OFDA's programs are appropriately responsive.</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the SHA in maintaining relations with the senior leadership of the Sudan humanitarian community in representing USAID and OFDA on humanitarian issues. This will include but is not limited to UN agencies, IOs, and NGOs, U.S. government personnel, donors, host government authorities, and others.</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel as permitted to assess, evaluate and monitor humanitarian conditions in Sudan, and make strategic recommendations for appropriate interventions.</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate in and report on joint donor humanitarian evaluations and UN-led assessments, and participate actively in the international community response structures.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in Sudan.  Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the SHA, Team Lead, and other staff current on response issues.  Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts.</p>
<p>&bull;	With guidance from the SHA, coordinate with the donor community on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations, and develop integrated, non-duplicative programs.</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare briefing papers, notes and presentations on OFDA programming for official U.S. government visitors interested in humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>&bull;	Conduct performance reviews and evaluations, and coordinate staff development plans for OFDA Sudan program team members, with guidance from the SHA.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Program Officer will take direction from and will report to the OFDA SHA for Sudan, located in Khartoum, Sudan, or his/her designee, and maintain close coordination with OFDA's Team Lead and the regional team for East and Central Africa, located in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative direction in terms of broadly defined goals and objectives.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with minimal direction and will exercise independent judgment in responding to humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as part of the Support Relief Group (SRG). It is the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)'s intent to contract for these services for a maximum of 250 days per calendar year.</p>
<p>The level of effort anticipated under this contract will be provided within the terms of this contract at times mutually agreed to by DCHA/OFDA and the contractor. Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, DCHA/OFDA will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>

The contractor shall notify OFDA at the time of commitment if their existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment but will simply assist DCHA/OFDA in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if the contractor agrees to an extension of the duration of a particular assignment, thereafter, the contractor will be required to give DCHA/OFDA 10 days' notice for release from the assignment.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance.  This Division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction.  DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide technical expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Support Relief Group (SRG) is a program developed by OFDA to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  The primary roles of SRG contactors include intermittent backfill for permanent staff deploying to overseas, cover vacancies domestically or in overseas offices, and to respond to numerous disasters worldwide in a timely manner.  Currently, about half of all SRG activations are domestic and half overseas in various capacities.</p>
<p>The SRG program brings on board select candidates who work on full-time for discrete periods of time, but on an intermittent basis for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and can be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters, or to backfill staff in Washington and other locations.  SRG staff can be used for as little as a day or up to several months at a time.  SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.</p>
<p>The SRG program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in OFDA's Operations Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted SRG personnel, providing information to the rest of OFDA on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified SRG for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing SRG.  Each SRG incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA/Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA needs to maintain a roster of SRG personnel to meet its surge capacity objectives, including individuals with administrative expertise to provide expert level administrative support to OFDA in Washington, DC, as well as overseas operations at USAID Missions and Embassies worldwide.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under U.S. personal services contracts (USPSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see:<br />http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Sr. Transition Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of lessons learned. The Sr. Transition Specialist is supervised by OTI's Chief of the Program Learning, and Innovation Division or his/her designee, or by any OTI division leader or his/her designee.</p>
<p>The Applied Best Practices &amp; Coordination (ABC) team supports OTI's mission by facilitating learning within country programs and across the office, providing leadership on the program strategic planning processes that form OTI's business model, identifying best practices and promoting innovation. The incumbent for this position will be expected to initially work with the Program, Learning, and Innovation Division (PLI), which develops, oversees, and manages critical processes supporting the implementation of OTI country programs.  In carrying out these responsibilities, the PLI Division engages with local partners (both government and non-governmental) in the country of operation, counterparts in the U.S. Embassy, the USAID Missions, USAID and Department of State Regional Bureaus, the National Security Council, the Congress, and foreign and international donor organizations.  The Sr. Transition Specialist will provide regular guidance and leadership for the OTI ABC team in Washington headquarters, including the management and supervision of ABC staff focusing on learning, training, innovation, monitoring and evaluation, and development of technology tools in support of OTI country programs.</p>
<p>In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Sr. Transition Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information and training they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions</span></strong>
<p><br />Is there any chance the VTE will be opened up to all business types? The small business set aside eliminates some companies from directly bidding, only allowing a number using a go-between vendor.</p>
<p><strong>No sir, The 100% small business set-aside was established based upon our market research which shows that we should have adequate competition.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally are there mandated hours for this project? Scope doesn't identify monthly visits or number of hours required per unit.</p>
<p><strong>There is a mandated CLIN structure for this requirement. The PWS reflects that a written maintenance control program will be developed for each VTE and all equipment In Accordance with the ASME A17.1 standards and delivered to the CO within 30 calendar days after contract award.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, there were a couple of units that are listed that currently are not in operation. Do you still need these priced and in the event you want them operational again how is this going to be handled?</p>
<p><strong>The only unit that is listed that is not operational is in bldg. 301, Martin Bomber/CES. Which is a cable/Freight elevator. A modification to the PWS is going to be posted today listing that this elevator will be excluded from this requirement. An addition will also be made to include a wheelchair lift in bldg. 88, Band Center. This lift was illustrated during the site visit.</strong></p>

<p>DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE CLAUSES:</p>
<p>PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENT TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (AUGUST 2012) (DEVIATION)<br />This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012.</p>
<p>(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor.</p>
<p>(b) Include the substance of this clause, including paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.</p>
<p>(c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />1352.201-70, CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (APRIL 2010) <br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate an SF30 Commercial Solicitation Amendment document to revise FAR clause 52.212-2 EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS to include additional guidance for proposing qualified replacement parts as a substitute for discontinued or obsolete parts. Additionally, the offerors' questions and responses posted via amendment 0001 have been incorporated into this document. Offerors are reminded to thoroughly read the Instructions to Offerors section and FAR clause 52.212-2 EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS. Please review and return one signed copy of the SF30 document via email to Lisa Zarick. See below for contact information. <br>  <br> The response due date has NOT been extended and remains unchanged. Proposals are due no later than 2:00pm EST Thursday, 14 October 2013. No late proposals will be accepted. <br>  <br>  <br> The following is the language from the original solicitation posting with updated dates to reflect changes made via amendments 0001 and 0002: <br>  <br> The following action is to be competed by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) to established multiple award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for brand name medical equipment repair and replacement parts. This announcement constitutes the solicitation by USAMRAA, Fort Detrick, MD as a Request for Proposals (RFP) and offers must be submitted in writing (oral offers will not be accepted). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27. <br>  <br> This is an unrestricted competition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 339112. <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION: USAMMA has recurring requirements for new (not used or refurbished) brand name medical equipment repair and replacement parts. Medical equipment used by deployed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan is returned to one of USAMMA's CONUS or OCONUS depots for repair, refurbishment or replacement when the repair exceeds the deployed unit's maintenance capability. With very few exceptions, medical equipment repair parts are available only from the manufacturer of the equipment or from a firm that has been licensed by the manufacturer to produce or sell authorized parts. See the attached SF 1449 solicitation document (and amendment documents) attached below for more information (under  quote mark additional information quote mark ). There is also a copy of a redacted justification and approval for other than full and open competition attached below. The Government intends to award multiple BPAs to fulfill the reoccurring need for brand name only medical equipment repair and replacement parts. Additionally, USAMRAA reserves the right to utilize the resultant BPAs for the Department of Defense medical community. Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of lowest price technically acceptable. <br>  <br> Delivery will be FOB Destination however, the Government will consider delivery order quotes supplied as FOB Origin (Pre-pay and Add) if the contractor is unable to provide the items FOB Destination such as shipment to OCONUS locations. Receiving points will include Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania; Tracy, California; Hill Air Force Base, Utah; (USAMMC-E) Pirmasens, Germany; (USAMMC-SWA) in Southwest Asia; and (USAMMC-K) in Korea. However, the Government may add additional receiving points. <br>  <br> No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued by this contracting office. All interested parties can view, download and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments from the following website: https://www.fbo.gov/. In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all contractors wishing to do business with the Department of Defense must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br>  <br>  <br> POINT OF CONTACT: Lisa Zarick, Contract Specialist <br> lisa.m.zarick.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> All questions in response to this RFP are due by 4:00pm EST 28 October 2013 and shall be sent via email to the address listed above. All proposals shall be submitted to the address listed above (preferably via email) no later than 2:00pm EST Thursday, 14 November 2013. No late proposals will be accepted. <br>  <br>

<a href="mailto:kristen.kachur@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>Request for Information on Bi-Static Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Sensor Systems for Cavity Detection  <br>    <br>  The U.S Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, on behalf of the US Technical Support Working Group (TSWG), is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for the state-of-the-art technology, within industry, in the area of Bi-Static Frequency Domain EM systems to identify the position, extent and depth of underground resistors (cavities or voids).  The TSWG is seeking sources interested in providing information and subject matter expertise on how to build, integrate, and deliver a state-of-the-art Bi-Static Frequency Domain EM (BSFDEM) sensor system that can identify the position, extent and depth of subsurface cavities and other resistive subsurface targets of interest.  The goal is to provide a BSFDEM that can identify the position, extent and depth of cavities with both high probability of detection and localization accuracy that is able to be transported, assembled, operated and disassembled by a two man team with all operators and components transported in a single vehicle.   <br>    <br>  The BSFDEM sensor system is composed of a magnetic field transmitter (TX), magnetic field sensors (RX), a highly accurate GPS unit (or units) and a processing unit. The Bi-Static system should include a transmitter that will be located at some distance from the void location. The transmitted field will interact with subsurface materials, both conductive and resistive, causing perturbations in the magnetic field(s) measured by the multiple magnetic field sensors. The processing unit should communicate with the magnetic field sensors and the GPS unit(s) to digitize and record the magnetic field data from the sensors and combine this data with the GPS location information.  <br>    <br>  The system should be composed primarily of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components to facilitate ease of obtaining parts and repair in austere locations supported primarily by local commercial vendors.    <br>    <br>  The estimated performance of the transmitter (TX), receiver sensing system (RX) and GPS are detailed in the following paragraphs. Responders are encouraged to review and propose changes in the proposed design in order to achieve performances that exceed those definitions of the system. System size, weight, power, cost, reliability and ease of operation are major factors that will be reviewed.   <br>    <br>  The transmitter (TX) should be able to emit continuous waveforms in the range 1 kHz to 1000 kHz in increments of no more than 50 kHz.  Multiple waveforms/frequencies simultaneously would be preferred.  The TX output should be adjustable and have a magnetic moment of at least 10 Amp meters (A?m); however, the TX power cannot be so strong as to interfere with FCC (or location equivalent) transmission restrictions.  The TX needs to be reasonably portable, requiring no more than two individuals to position and set up.  TX power supply must be portable (e.g., rechargeable battery).  <br>    <br>  The receiver (RX) component should be capable of sensing continuous waveforms in the range 1 kHz to 1000 kHz.  Multiple waveforms/frequencies simultaneously would be preferred.  24-bit A/D resolution is required.  The RX component must be lightweight (less than 25 lbs) such that it is man-portable with the potential option to vehicle-mount or tow the RX.  Power supply should be integrated into sensor.  <br>    <br>  System setup time should be less than 0.5 hours and any subsequent system calibration or configuration changes should take no more than 10-15 minutes.  The system should be able to be transported to/from a survey site by a passenger vehicle (e.g., van).  The system is required to yield a sensitivity of 10 femtotesla (fT) or better with a noise level of approximately 1 fT/Hz1/2.  Output of the system must be at a minimum of 10 Hz and reflect the least amount of signal processing necessary.  EM data should be geotagged with GPS position data having accuracy better than 20 cm.  Raw data storage should be internal to the system (hard memory, solid state drive). Access to the data should be easy and simple (e.g. USB port, SD card, etc.). Redundant data storage would be preferred with the raw data being stored to more than one on board storage location or sent to another storage device wirelessly. During operation the user should be provided system health messages onscreen (e.g. battery life, proper data storage, GPS operational, etc.) During operation the user should be provided real-time data onscreen.  The system must be able to run continuously for a minimum of 2 hours and function in extreme weather, with temperatures ranging from 0 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.    <br>    <br>  Sensors must be software controllable through the processing unit with an integrated Graphical User Interface (GUI).    <br>    <br>  Government purpose rights for all source and compiled code is encouraged (and may be required) as part of any system.  <br>    <br>  Responses to this RFI must be unclassified. Responses should be submitted no later than 1700 hours on 06 January 2014.   <br>    <br>  Electronic responses are to be in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word format using a size 12 font with one inch margins.  Adobe PDF format is preferred.  Responses should include a cover letter and at a minimum, provide the following:  <br>    <br>      1. A cover letter (optional)  <br>  2. A cover page labeled with the heading  BSFDEM for Cavity Detection, name of company, name of corporate point of contact (POC), name of technical POC, telephone number for each POC, full mailing address, e-mail addresses for each POC, CAGE Code, and any other pertinent information.   <br>  3. No more than fifteen pages of technical information including:  <br>  (a) Component and system technical descriptions, system block diagram and estimated performance  <br>  (b) Narrative describing how the specified technical requirements would be addressed and fulfilled  <br>  (c) Corporate competencies and past performance experience with regard to development and modification of commercial systems including relevant history of ability to develop and integrate similar technologies  <br>  (d) Rough estimate of costs and timeline  <br>  (e) An indication as to whether the technology is sufficiently mature to build and demonstrate, or whether additional development would be more appropriate prior to a subsequent build. Prefer technology solutions with readiness levels that can support production and fielding within the next two years.  <br>  (f) Describe any Independent Research and Development (IRAD) programs applicable to this RFI regarding government modified commercial systems for applications such as this.  <br>  (g) changes in the proposed design to achieve performances that exceed definitions of the system    <br>  4. Specification sheets and product information may also be provided in addition to the Response.  <br>    <br>  Please submit all pages as a single (.doc or .pdf) file.  Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED.  Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  <br>    <br>  This request for information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or a commitment by the U.S. Government.  The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of the market survey. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a separate solicitation notice will be published.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.   <br>    <br>  All responsible, interested sources are encouraged to submit their capabilities/qualification data along with any questions no later than 06 January 2014 to the following: U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey(ACC-NJ), ATTN: Kristen Kachur, ACC-NJ-ET, Building 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, email: kristen.e.kachur.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>This modification removes 19/32" socket from NSN 5120-00-NIB-0115.<br /><br />This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.

Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.

<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Kansas City, MO.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income. Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies. The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN: 5120-00-NIB-0111<br />ETS Stock Numbers: SA102TB; SA106TB; SM12T; 110TMDY; 110TMY</p>

<p>NSN: 5120-00-NIB-0119<br />ETS Stock Numbers: 317MPC</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement. That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1. Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data. Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2. Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period. If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3. Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on. Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4. If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5. Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6. The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7. Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8. Provide your firm's DUNS number. The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9. Include your firm's mailing address. Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box. The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response. Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 13, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC><p>Below please find the National Park Service's (NPS) response to the remaining question and correspondence submitted in regard to the Prospectus for a Concession Business Opportunity to provide lodging, retail, food and beverage and other services (CC-GRCA001-15).</p>
<p>Please note all potential Offerors should read the questions and responses for both CC-GRCA001-15 and CC-GRCA003-15, as there is some information in each that may be of assistance in preparing a proposal to either solicitation.</p>
<p>1. Based on the provisions in 16 USC 5954(a)(4), the current prospectus, and NPS Federal Register notices in connection with solicitations for Shenandoah and Signal Mountain Lodge concessions, it appears that NPS is using an alternative formula for LSI valuation under the current prospectus. Please confirm that in accordance with 16 USC 5954(a)(4), if no responsive offer is received in response to the current prospectus, the concession opportunity will be re-solicited with the LSI value as described in paragraph (a)(3) of 16 USC 5954.</p>
<p>It is premature to announce how the NPS might restructure the prospectus if no responsive offer is received to the current prospectus. In the event of a resolicitation, the NPS may restructure any terms of the prospectus as permitted by law.</p>
<p>2. The Proposal Instructions state that the NPS will respond to any submitted questions in writing and will provide the questions and responses to all potential Offerors who have requested a Prospectus. During this solicitation, the NPS received a letter that did not contain an express question but did criticize the NPS for allocating many assets and their associated LSI that had previously been assigned to the GRCA001 Contract to the Draft GRCA003 Contract. The writer alleged that allocating approximately $50,000,000 in LSI to the Draft GRCA003 Contract (when its predecessor had no LSI) made the smaller South Rim contract uncompetitive (because the offeror would have to pay the holder of the LSI its value as part of the initial investment). Note: the NPS total estimated initial investment is $49,885,579, which includes the LSI of $41,161,579.</p>
<p>The NPS's primary motivations for realigning the services and associated assets were to create efficiencies at some locations, like Desert View, and to create an opportunity for healthy competition for lodging and dining in the South Rim Village. The NPS believes that visitors would benefit greatly from more diversified offerings and competition among concessioners on the South Rim. Realigning the services and associated assets did add initial LSI to CC-GRCA003-15 where under the Existing Contract there is none. The intention was not to put it out of reach of smaller companies, but rather to create a more robust portfolio of services with a strong opportunity for profit that would enhance competition.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. Any information submitted by respondents in response to this request for information is strictly voluntary. This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor does its issuance restrict the Government to any ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that may be submitted by respondents to this RFI.
The purpose of this RFI is to gather market research to assist NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (NAVSUP FLC) Norfolk  Mechanicsburg Office in acquiring a ship maintenance planning solution for the Management Systems Support Division (MSSD) in support of the Submarine Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SUBMEPP), the Surface Maintenance Engineering Planning Program (SURFMEPP) and the Carrier Planning Activity (CPA).
 The existing maintenance planning solution was developed by the Navy in the 1990s for use by SUBMEPP and has been expanded to encompass SURFMEPP and CPA. The US Navy is seeking to implement a solution that will provide the capabilities to support ship/platform maintenance planning. The US Navys maintenance requirements are expected to grow and change over time, as new ship platforms are brought into the inventory and old platforms are retired. The US Navy intends to acquire a solution that will support efforts to update and modernize the current maintenance planning tool.
As part of the market research being gathered, the three planning activities are requesting vendor demonstrations using the attached information as a framework.
 These examples are designed to allow vendors to illustrate how their application would address operations considered essential to naval lifecycle maintenance planning. The following documents are attached to this notice:
-Request for Demonstration
-Copy of Platform Schedule
-Configuration Data for Demonstration
-Demonstration Location Information
The demonstrations will be held the week of December 2, 2013 at the following address:
Dell Federal service
383 Central Ave
Suite 1
Dover, NH 03820
Vendors interested in participating in the demonstrations shall contact Lauren Johnson via email at lauren.johnson@navy.mil by November 22, 2013 at 6 pm EST. Interested Vendors will then be notified of the date and time of their presentation.
 Presentation times will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. There will be two four-hour time slots each day. Additional time slots will be made available if needed. Vendors are requested to arrive no more than 30 minutes prior to their scheduled time slot. The room will contain a screen, projector and conference lines. It is recommended that Vendor bring their own computers.
Vendors are not required to participate in the demonstrations. Vendors that do not participate in the demonstration process will not be precluded from participating in any RFP developed from this RFI. The Government will not pay for any expenses associated with the demonstration process.

<DESC>Project Description:  <br>  The Canaveral lock was constructed in 1951 with timber approach guide walls extending approximately 600 feet from both the East and West side of the monolith lock structure. The approach timber guide walls were previously repaired in 1979, but the environmental deterioration has created some timber piles in a state of failure. This makes the deteriorated portions of the approach walls unsuitable to resist the required mooring or impact loads.   <br>  Project scope is to provide a repair for the Canaveral Lock East and West timber approach walls to prevent failure and restore the walls to an operational condition. New fiberglass/concrete composite marine pilings shall be installed to replace the existing piles. Fiber-reinforced plastic  <br>  fenders and structural plastic framing will be removed and either replaced or reinstalled as detail in the contract drawings. Member connections shall use stainless hardware and all existing hardware shall be replaced with stainless steel. Existing creosote timber marine piles shall be removed at the mudline. All removed creosote timber bracing, marine piles, and fenders shall be disposed in an approved landfill. Work also includes the service of a dedicated manatee observer. Location: The work is located at the Canaveral Lock and Barge Canal, Canaveral Harbor, Brevard County, Florida along the eastern coastline of Florida. The Lock and Barge Canal work area can be accessed via Port Canaveral ocean entrance, Canaveral Barge Canal from the Intracoastal Waterway, and Interstate 95 and local connectors. The magnitude of construction for this project is estimated to be between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. THIS IS AN SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE PROCUREMENT.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 01 Aug 2013 with proposal due on or about 01 Sep 2013. Solicitation will be issued in electronic format only and will be posted on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at  https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/. In order to receive notification of any amendments to this solicitation, interested vendors must REGISTER AS AN INTERESTED VENDOR on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. If you are not registered, the Government is not responsible with providing you with notification of any changes to this solicitation.

<DESC>As indicated in the Project Background, the Lower Mon project requires funding at 50% from the General Treasury and 50% from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF). Currently, the IWTF only generates enough funding to support one major project in a fiscal year. Currently, the Nation's number one priority Inland Navigation Project is the Olmsted Locks and Dam. Olmsted Project was expected to reach its authorized spending limit in FY 2014, which would have stopped construction until reauthorized by Congress. However, recent legislation has reauthorized the Olmsted Locks and Dam construction at a higher spending limit, therefore, the potential for issuing a solicitation for the Charleroi River Chamber Completion is indefinitely postponed until such time that funding becomes available.

<DESC>W912EF-14-R-SS07 <br> THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. <br> This notice is a market research tool used for planning purpose only to determine the availability and capability of small business sources prior to issuance of an RFP.  The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Walla Walla District is seeking to identify small business firms capable of performing tests on passive integrated transponders (PIT) tags from several manufactures.  A PIT tag is classified as a sonar reading tag under the Standard Industrial Code #3812 and is subject to radio frequency licensing. The PIT tags being tested will be glass-encapsulated measuring approximately 12-12.5 mm long by 2.0-2.1 mm in diameter.  The tag can be coded with one of 35 billion unique codes.      <br> All interested and capable contractors are encouraged to respond.  The Government will not pay for any information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the sources sought evaluation.  One of the main functions of this sources sought notice is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining whether an 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Certified HUBZone Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB) or Small Business set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement.  If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis may be used to aid in establishing realistic, achievable small business subcontracting goals.  <br> An Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contact is anticipated.  The IDIQ work may be ordered on a Task Order, on a need basis.  The order will specify the exact location and types of work to be accomplished.   <br>  <br> The anticipated contract award date for these services is early January 2014.  <br>  <br> The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project will be 541380 and the associated small business size standard is $14,000,000.   <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT <br> Overview of Work Required:  The test must be performed by an independent group that will not be a potential supplier in the future.  Potential supply venders will submit a quantity of 200 PIT tags that are 12mm long.  A series of tests will be conducted to evaluate the physical and electrical performance of PIT tags that are submitted by other vendors.  <br> Physical Dimensions:  The length, diameter, and weight of each tag will be measured to verify the tag is minimally obstructive to the fish. <br> Electrical Properties Test:  The resonant frequency, turn on voltage, modulation values and band width of each tag will be measured to evaluate whether the tags meet the minimum standard. <br> Read Range Test: A series of read range tests will be conducted under different noise levels and tag orientation to measure a particular tag type's ability to perform in electorally environments.  <br>  <br> Proximity Tag Testing:  A series of tag testing will be conducted to evaluate whether tags in close proximity of each other will occlude other tags from being read. If the candidate tags are too weak; studies using those tags will suffer due to the preponderance of the stronger production tags. If the candidate tags are too strong; studies using the current production tags may be at risk for missed interrogations.   <br> Durability Test: A drop test will be performed to test the durability of the tags since the tags are encapsulated in glass to protect the electrical components from water.  The glass must be relatively sturdy and resist breakage to maintain the waterproof property.  <br> SUBMITTAL REQUIRMENTS <br>  <br> Firms interested in this requirement should submit a statement of interest and capabilities that is no more than 10 pages in length, single-spaced, 12-point font minimum demonstrating ability to perform the requested services. <br>  <br> The capability package must be complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the firm's qualifications to perform the defined work. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from the potential sources as a result of this synopsis. The documentation shall address, as a minimum, the following:  <br>  <br> (1) STATEMENT OF INTEREST <br>  <br> (a) Confirm that your company is interested and intends to submit a quote / bid / proposal when a solicitation is issued. <br>  <br> (2) COMPANY PROFILE  <br>  <br> (a) Company name and address <br> (b) Point of contact at the company including name, title, telephone number, fax number and e-mail addresses <br> (c) Small Business designation/status if applicable, such as 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, SDB <br> (d) DUNS number <br> (e) CAGE code. <br>  <br> (3) RELEVANT COMPANY and PERSONNEL EXPERIENCE <br>  <br> (a) Describe the company's ability to mobilize to project locations within 24 hours after receipt of notice to proceed. <br> (b) Describe the company's personnel, certifications, and equipment. <br> (c) Experience of company as an electronic testing facility in performing efforts of similar value, size, and scope within the last three (3) years at USACE or other hydroelectric and / or navigational structures managed by the U.S. Government, State, County, City, or public or private utility company. <br>  (d) Experience of key personnel as an electronic testing facility in performing efforts of similar value, size, and scope within the last three (3) years at USACE or other hydroelectric and / or navigational structures managed by the U.S. Government, State, County, City, or public or private utility company. quote mark  <br>  <br> For items 3(c) and 3(d), include (1) Contract Number and Project Title; (2) Name of Contracting Activity; (3) Administrative Contract Officer's Name, Telephone Number and E-mail; (4) Contracting Officer's Technical Representative or Primary Point of Contact, telephone and email; (5) Indication of whether your firm acted as a prime or subcontractor, (6) Contract Period of Performance and Contract Value; and (7) Brief summary of work performed and how it relates to the technical services described herein. <br>  <br> Responses are due no later than 11/18/2013.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 11,  VA Ann Arbor Medical Center

VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System
2215 Fuller Road (54 P&C)
Ann Arbor, MI 48105

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

This document documents the justification and approval for use of  the use of other than full and open competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1 a(2) One Responsible Source.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

A consignment contract with Medtronic Inc. for various stents, balloons, filters, and guide wires used for a variety of purposes during surgeries. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

41 USC 253(g), as implemented by FAR 6.302.  

	(X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

These are supplies for cardiac catheterization procedures in the Cardiac Catheterization and Electrophysiology Laboratories from Medtronic.  The supplies are selected based on their specific use during procedures and often times, supplies from several vendors may be used during one procedure based on what the Surgeons find during the procedure.  Consignment contracts allow the VA to keep several of these short shelf life items in the facility without having to buy them until they are used.  The items requested meet the strict requirements of quality and functionality for which procedures they are chosen for.  The VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System maintains several consignment contracts simultaneously but each is put in place as a sole source contract so that the facility can stock that particular vendor's supplies.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

Talks with the vendor's sales staff and internet searches have revealed that this vendor is the only vendor that is willing to enter into an contract of this nature.  If it is discovered that there are other sources that will enter into this type of a contract, the facility is willing to try those products or enter into a contract competitively.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The contracting officer will determine the proposed prices fair and reasonable prior to contract award.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

GSA was searched, vendor sales representatives were talked to and the research determined that no other Government contracts were available to provide these supplies on a consignment basis.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

N/A

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

See section VI above.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

Should a procurement of this nature reoccur, the market will again be surveyed to locate possible new sources.








12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR A LIMITED SOURCE AWARD UNDER A FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center-Austin
     	1701 Directors Blvd
 				Austin, TX 78744

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a two-month firm-fixed-price task order with one three-month option to lease satellite bandwidth via the Galaxy 18 satellite for the VA Knowledge Network (VAKN) serving the VA Learning University (VALU) and the Employee Education System (EES).  This effort is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program; the proposed effort will be awarded under the General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Commercial Satellite Communications Transponded Communications (COMSATCOM) Contract Number GS-35F-0478U, to Intelsat General Corporation, 6550 Rock Spring Drive, Suite 450, Bethesda, MD 20817-1112.   

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  VALU and EES seek to lease 18 MHz of non-preemptible bandwidth, 24/7, Vert Up polarity, Ku- band bandwidth with continuous uninterrupted service via the Galaxy 18 satellite.  VALU and EES use a satellite delivery system for the transmission and delivery of video, audio, and internet protocol data for the VAKN and the Content Delivery Network (CDN).  VAKN is an e-learning initiative to effectively distribute educational programs to VA employees via digital satellite technology.  VA employees can watch VAKN video programs at their workstations, connected conference rooms, and other VA closed-circuit television systems by going to the CDN website at http://vaww.vakncdn.lrn.va.gov.  Since 2000, over 400 VAKN satellite dishes were installed at VA facilities nationwide.  This bandwidth will provide for three conventional channels and four channels of Internet Protocol (IP) video required for the continued operation of the CDN.  VA's digital satellite network utilizes fixed receiving dishes.  The total estimated value of the proposed action is $427,500.00 (inclusive of options).                                                     
4.  Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this proposed action is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), "In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures."  The original order was placed in accordance with applicable FSS ordering procedures and was not previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures.

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Intelsat General Corporation's Galaxy 18 KU-Band satellite is used to distribute educational and training content to over 400 VA facilities throughout the Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  If an additional vendor is selected, VA would incur additional risk if the satellite was changed, or the current satellite was leased from a reseller.  First, if VA changed satellites, there would be an operational downtime of six weeks for a transition to a new satellite, as well as significant costs estimated to be at least $637,500.00 more than the proposed effort in order to repoint 400 satellite downlink locations to a new vendor's satellite space segment.  This value does not include the administrative hours by VA staff to coordinate the re-alignment of the satellite dishes across the agency, assure line-of-site to another satellite, re-program receivers, and ensure simultaneous transmission between the current and new satellite to prevent disruption of services.  In addition, the use of a different satellite would not assure line-of site accessibility since many dishes are ground-mounted next to buildings, roofs, and other obstructions.  Secondly, while other sources could lease the Galaxy 18 bandwidth, it would be at a 31 percent price premium since the sources are resellers of the bandwidth as opposed to Intelsat General Corporation, the owner of the Galaxy 18 satellite.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section in paragraph 8 below.  No competition is anticipated for this effort.  GSA Schedule 70 COMSATCOM has 22 schedule vendors capable of providing satellite services; however, there is no competition anticipated for this acquisition, as detailed in the above section.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2), this action will be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO) and the justification will be made publically available.  

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  No barriers to future competition are anticipated.  A competitive contract is anticipated to be awarded on January 1, 2014, which would allow VA to avoid the option period mentioned in paragraph two.  

8.  Market Research:  Market Research efforts were conducted by Government technical experts in May and October of 2013, and it was discovered while other sources could lease the Galaxy 18 bandwidth that it would be at a 31 percent price premium since the sources are resellers of the bandwidth as opposed to Intelsat General Corporation, the owner of the Galaxy 18 satellite.  Furthermore, Government technical experts revealed that switching to another satellite would cost at least $637,500.00 more to repoint 400 satellite dishes to a new satellite that the estimate value of the proposed action.  This value does not include the administrative hours by VA staff to coordinate the re-alignment of the satellite dishes across the agency, assure line-of-site to another satellite, re-program receivers, and ensure simultaneous transmission between the current and new satellite to prevent disruption of services.  Also, another unknown cost is a condition whereby downlink dishes are positioned an placed at site locations around the country for a line of site to receive the signal from the Galaxy 18 satellite; the use of a different satellite would not assure line-of-site accessibility since many dishes are ground-mounted next to buildings, roofs, and other obstructions.  Government technical experts also conducted a search of the GSA Schedule 70 COMSATCOM in services for additional sources that could provide the aforementioned services.  It was determined that while other sources could lease satellite bandwidth, Intelsat General Corporation is best positioned to provide satellite bandwidth without interrupted service, and at the best value to the Government.

9.  Other Facts: The original order for this effort is VA118A-12-F-0184 and was competitively awarded under GSA Schedule 70 COMSATCOM contract GS-35F-0478U on October 1, 2011, for $1,795,500.00.  Intelsat General Corporation submitted the most advantageous savings to VA during the previous satellite bandwidth competition.  This effort meets the criteria stated, which requires that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable FSS ordering procedures and was not issued under sole source or limited source procedures.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">The Space and Missile Systems Center, Range and Network Systems Division (SMC/RN) intends to extend the Launch &amp; Test Range System (LTRS) Systems Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) contract with Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., which ends on 7 December 2013, on a sole source basis.&nbsp; The performance period for the proposed contract action will consist of a six-month base period (8 December 2013 - 7 June 2014) and, as required, two three-month option periods (8 June 2014 - 7 December 2014).<br /><br />SMC/RN is planning for a competitive procurement to acquire SE&amp;I support for the three (3) programs which comprise SMC/RN for the period starting in FY14 through FY19.&nbsp; These programs are the Launch &amp; Test Range System (LTRS), Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN), and the Space Training Acquisition Office (STAO).&nbsp; The market research used to determine if this effort should be competitive was conducted for the upcoming combined SE&amp;I support contract.&nbsp; It showed that 17 companies are able to provide this support; however, the schedule requirements for competition at this stage of the acquisition process would undoubtedly preclude award from being made before 7 December 2013 resulting in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.&nbsp; The source is:<br /><br />Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.<br />8283 Greensboro Dr.<br />McLean, VA 22102-3838<br /><br />Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within <strong>fifteen (15) calendar days</strong> of this posting; however, this is NOT a request for competitive proposals.&nbsp; Interested parties must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government, and the services required will be provided in a timely and effective manner to meet the Government's requirements.&nbsp; A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 4,  Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of Home Oxygen Services from the incumbent to cover the time December 1, 2013 through April 30, 2014.  Columbia Ancillary Services, Inc. is the incumbent of an expired contract.   This requirement is procured under NIACS 532291 with a new size standard of $30,000,000. The procurement process was previously interrupted by a protest ruling.  The Government initiated a new procurement process and it has been interrupted by three additional protests. A ruling on the most recent protest by the Court of Federal Claims has not been rendered to date and there is no projected date.  This interim contract will provide Home Oxygen Services during the gap between the expired contract and the new contract to be awarded after protest ruling.
3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  
The contractor will provide Home Oxygen Services and related supplies for Veterans and Beneficiaries of the Louis A. Johnson Healthcare System. The VAMC currently serves an estimated 1500 patients covering parts of northern West Virginia, southeast Ohio and southwest Pennsylvania. Required services include storage, delivery, set-up, adjustment, patient/caregiver instructions and recovery of equipment.  Contractors shall have applicable expertise in government acquisition and program management disciplines.  This contract covers December 1, 2013 through April 30, 2014.  The length of service is the estimated procurement lead time that would be required to finalize the acquisition process once a protest decision is rendered.
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c), as implemented by FAR 6.302.  
	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Validity of Use (applicability of authority):   
Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency Requirement: The incumbent is currently performing this complex requirement at a satisfactory level.   A change in vendor would require finding a vendor that is capable of servicing approximately 1500 veterans across a diverse geographical area. None of our known interested vendors currently service this area. The Vendor would need to be established locally before the start of the period of performance as to meet the response time indicated in the statement of work.  A vendor must also have ample rental equipment and supplies available to provide the required services and supplies to patients. Based on past experience and input from colleagues throughout the VISN, the Chief of Prosthetics estimates it would take approximately 45-60 days after the period of performance begins to fully and safely switch contractors.  For this requirement, a disruption in services is not an acceptable solution.  
Unusual and Compelling Urgency: We have received a total of five protest regarding this requirement.  Two against the previous solicitation, in which a ruling caused the Government to cancel that solicitation and reissue, and three against this solicitation. We are awaiting a ruling on the most recent protest to the Court of Federal Claims.  This solicitation is extended indefinitely.  It is imperative that our patients have home oxygen services that are uninterrupted.  Our contract has expired which has made it necessary to put in place an interim contract.   A protest decision is imminent and could be rendered any day.  In September, the Contracting Officer through the DOJ Attorney recently petitioned the court and explained the need for a timely decision.  We had anticipated a decision would be rendered before the last interim contract expired but it was not.  We are unable to plan and advertise a long term contract because the Government is staying while we await a decision.  This has put the Government in a situation where we must have services for the veteran, but are unable to competitively award such service creating an environment where there is only one responsible source and an urgent and compelling need.
This option represents the best value for the government and provides for continuity of care for our veterans.   The incumbent is honoring prices from the last contract to bridge the gap between the expired contract and the new award. There will be no cumbersome process for exit and entrance between vendors.  The incumbent is already set up to provide this service in the geographical area and they are proven capable and responsible.  Their staff is familiar with our patients and our processes.  For a five month contract sole sourcing our requirement to the incumbent is the only viable option available to the Government.
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
Changing vendors for a 5-month period while the contract requirement is being solicited is not an option based on the complexity of this requirement. There is approximately 1500 veterans serviced by this contract.  The vast geographical areas serviced by this contract make it difficult and expensive to have the equipment switched out.   The contractor is responsible for providing all the equipment and supplies that are necessary to service this contract.  The award of a contract for a base plus four option years is anticipated within 90 days after the protest is ruled on and the solicitation can be closed.

The Contracting Officer made an effort to petition the court to deliver a timely decision in September 2012. The Contracting Officer has made multiple attempts to award a competitive contract, but due to multiple protests and a delay in the court ruling in the most recent protest, the Contracting Officer has been unsuccessful in awarding a competitive acquisition.
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  
The anticipated price to the Government is $ 497,472.50.  This option represents the best value for the government.   The incumbent is honoring prices from the last contract to bridge the gap between the expired contract and the new award. This price has already been proven fair and reasonable five years ago when the last contract was awarded and again each time an interim contract was put in place.  Based on proposals received on the first solicitation (that was rescinded due to a sustained protest, the price is fair and reasonable) the price is considered fair and reasonable.  Based on comparisons to prices of other VA contracts, the prices is fair and reasonable (FAR 15.404-1). The incumbent is already set up to provide this service and they are proven capable and responsible.    
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
The Government is awarding this contract to the incumbent to bridge the gap between the expired contract and the award of the contract currently under solicitation. Market research was completed for the solicitation currently under protest.  Based on that market research the long term procurement was designated as 100% HubZone set-aside. Market Research was conducted by advertising a sources sought notice through FedBizOpps under NAICS Code 532291.  One SDVOSB/HubZone, two Small Businesses/HubZone and one Large Businesses responded who were considered capable.    
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: NA 
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: No one has expressed in writing that they are interested in performing this interim contract or any of the others.  For the long term contract, One SDVOSB/HubZone, two Small Businesses/HubZone and one Large Businesses responded to the sources sought.
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Procurement will be competitively acquired as a 100% HubZone set-aside once there is a protest ruling.  The interim contract is sole sourced to a small business.
