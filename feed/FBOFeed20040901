<DESC>It is the intent of the Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to acquire professional services on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 from Dr. Jay Brown, Indiana, for the purpose of providing specialized consultation on Haz-Map database in the NLM environment.  The period of performance is for one (1) year with two successive one-year option periods.  

SIS offers a variety of toxicology information to the public through the Internet.  This information takes the form of bibliographic files such as TOXLINE and data files such as the Hazardous Substances Databank (HSDB).  Most files are not structured in such a way that a symptom developed in the workplace, such as “rash”, can be tracked back to a given chemical or chemical class and/or type of job.  Haz-Map, created by Dr. Jay Brown is such a database and it provides linkage between symptoms, jobs and chemicals.  The experimental Haz-Map web site was made available to the public in May 2002.   

Specifically, Dr. Brown shall: update the data in Haz-Map for completeness and compatibility with the SIS suite of databases; provide a list of core journals that are used for updating the content of the file and search PubMed for relevant information; provide Internet sources of relevant images for diseases and findings; enhance the job table by adding information on cancer risk (can be added in a new field); and consider ways for including new jobs not classified in the SOC code. 

Dr. Brown is uniquely qualified to offer these services.  Dr. Brown is the originator and sole author of Haz-Map and makes it available to NLM as a public resource.  Dr. Brown holds M.D. and M.P.H. degrees and is Board Certified in Occupational Medicine by the American Board of Preventive Medicine.  Dr. Brown has over ten years of experience working in occupational medicine clinics.  

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).
 
This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) key personnel must have earned a MD degree, Master in Public Health and be Board Certified in Occupational Medicine (35%); 2) experience in formatting developing and maintaining biomedical relational databases and the ability to assemble, organize, analyze and disseminate a variety of biomedical materials in electronic environment for the use of public domain (25%); 3) ability to demonstrate extensive working knowledge and experience working with medical literature and chemical information regulations (20%); 4) key personnel must have at least 5 years experience in occupational medicine clinics and an extensive working knowledge of them (20%).

Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-234/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Neha Dhir on 301-496-6546.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Lincoln Technologies, Inc. of  Wellesley, Hills, MA 02481.  Lincoln Technologies has participated in a multi-year collaboration with the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) that has resulted in Lincoln’s creation of WebDVDME. Lincoln will collaborate further with the FDA to test and deploy WebDVDME as a tool for assisting safety evaluators and epidemiologists in both CDER and CBER.  Data mining is a technique for extracting meaningful, organized information from large complex databases. There has been increasing interest in the use of data mining technology to enhance the FDA’s ability to monitor the safety products after they have been approved for use.  The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) received approximately 100,000 adverse event reports annually. Currently, no standard statistical tools are in place to detect signals among these reports. The purpose of this project is to support an evaluation by CDRH of the potential value of data mining in the device setting.  This tool may optimize evaluation resources and enhance CDRH’s ability to identify device-related safety concerns.  The use of enhanced data mining techniques may improve upon CDRH’s current ability to identify adverse event patterns in post-market safety databases.
An award will be made ten (10) days from the date of this notice. Sources with the capability of  performing these services must submit descriptive literature which fully demonstrates their capabilities. The FDA will review and consider these submissions in making its award decision. The award will be made as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Email inquiries should be sent to Mary.Farrell@FDA.GOV.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services IAW with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. 27291904. The solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990. The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to The Food and Drug Law Institute, 1000 Vermont Avenue, NW, Suite 2001, Washington, DC 20005 for a Food, Drug and Law Institute (FDLI) sponsored workshop on Methods for Routine Documentation of Medical Device Use. 

Background: CDRH’s mission to fully monitor the safety of medical devices would be more feasible once device model information is collected and its use is routinely documented. Good documentation of both device use and problems are necessary for scientifically investigating the safety of devices. For patient safety reporting of adverse device events, it is essential that a device be uniquely identified. For improving patient safety, reports of adverse device events may be lead to analysis of the use of all or a sample of a particular device to obtain information about the likelihood of such events and may lead to patient follow-up by providers of their patients using such devices. In these cases, having unique device identification in the patients’ medical records, and pointers to a database for information about that specific device is necessary. One way to examine and facilitate potential solutions to the issue of unique identification is to bring experts from the relevant fields together to discuss the problem and recommend actions.  

The purpose of this project is to work with representatives from medical device industry representatives, major bar-coding systems, FCC representatives, the radio frequency identification industry, National Library of Medicine, other Federal agencies and academia. We want to obtain their feedback regarding the development of a public-private partnership with the idea of adopting a unique identification system for medical devices.  The end goal might then be the collection of this information via the FDA web based electronic system agency wide registration and listing system (FURLS) and the drafting of the regulations that would be required in order to collect this information.  The best vehicle for this work is through targeted workshops with these organizations.

The contractor will need to perform the Scope of Work, which is to include:
Requesting professional services to host and facilitate two workshops to obtain feedback on the development of a unique identification system for medical devices. These workshops would be held with CDRH and invited members of industry, government and academia to discuss this issue.  These workshops will be held at the FDLI office located in Washington, D.C. 1) Participants of the workshop will be given preliminary documentation to review prior to the meeting.  The information will describe where we are at with a unique identification system; 2) Attendees will participate in an information exchange with CDRH so that we can gain a better understanding of the impact and process of the proposed development of a public-private partnership with the goal of adopting a unique identification system for medical devices; 3) Two workshops will be held on the development of a public-private partnership with the goal of adopting a unique identification system for medical devices. The length of each workshop will be one and one-half days with dates to be determined.

Tasks for each workshop: a) Determine the list of non-FDA attendees based on their knowledge and experience with the medical device industry and academia.  CDRH will provide a list of criteria for which they will use to nominate these outside individuals and organizations; b) Prepare and mail invitations or email invitations along with any written materials provided by FDA; c) Facilitate each meeting/workshop held at FDLI’s Office/location; d) Record the information exchange at each workshop. This will include documenting of decisions and findings. These reports will be provided to CDRH within two weeks after a meeting is held. Contractor shall provide an electronic version (pdf) and hard copy of these minutes to each attendee. Contractor shall provide CDRH with an additional copy in Microsoft word format.

The contractor shall have a good grasp on how medical devices are manufactured and used. They must have an excellent understanding of the type of participants that need to be involved and have already established working relationships with many of the groups that the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) will need to use for this workshop.

Payment Schedule: Payment shall be made upon completion of all tasks and deliverables associated with a single workshop upon submission of an invoice. All payments are subject to the approval of the Project Officer. 

The FDA intends to make an award immediately following this notice. The anticipated period of performance will be approximately September 27, 2004 through September 30, 2005.

The following FAR clauses shall apply to the solicitation: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications; 52.214-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers. All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above. All questions should be submitted in writing via email to sharon.savage@fda.hhs.gov or fax to (301) 827-7106. FAR provisions can be found at the following website: http://www.arnet.gov.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties may submit a statement of interest only.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) plans to procure services on a sole source basis for Developing a Communications Infrastructure for Researchers in Tobacco and Health Disparities with The Pennsylvania State University, 201 Henderson Building, University Park, PA 16802.
The supplies and services are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The proposed project aims to develop a multi-channel communications plan for senior researchers interested in tobacco and health disparities. The multi-channel communications plan shall provide a mechanism for promoting collaboration and disseminating information to senior researchers on relevant funding mechanisms, conferences/meetings, published papers, reports, and proposed and existing projects related to tobacco and health disparities.  The Pennsylvania State University is uniquely qualified to perform the duties and can perform this work in the most efficient and cost-effective manner for the government.  They have experience in cancer prevention, tobacco control and health disparities, and have worked with researchers from multiple disciplines on a variety of health disparities issues. Pennsylvania State has facilitated multi-channel communications mechanisms among research groups and engaged researchers in issues related to tobacco and health disparities via email, in-person meetings, and written communications. Researchers at Pennsylvania State have worked in the past with NCI on building its health disparities research agenda in tobacco control including publishing several papers and reports and are well-positioned to lead this effort to develop the multi-channel communications plan. These linkages will result in greater awareness of the science in tobacco and health disparities and increased networking among researchers on issues related to tobacco and health disparities.   This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source basis services for  Measurement of Estradiol for Health, Eating, Activity and Lifestyle (HEAL) Study of Breast Cancer Prognosis with University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, 1 University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The HEAL Study of Breast Cancer Prognosis is an observational study in a multiethnic cohort of  about 1200 women with early stage breast cancer to examine the association of weight, physical activity, diet, serum hormones, tumor characteristics, and breast cancer prognosis.  Women are enrolled in three sites across the United States: New Mexico, Seattle, and Los Angeles.  The purpose of this project is to perform estradiol assays for the New Mexico sample of women for the baseline survey.  The measurement of estradiol was done for the Seattle and Los Angeles sites at baseline and for all sites at the 24-month, using a RIA method.  The New Mexico site used Quest laboratories, a commercial laboratory, to obtain the estradiol assays at 24-months.  All sites used the RIA method.  In order to have comparable serum estradiol measurements across the three study sites, it is essential that the same methodology is used for all sites.  Further, it will be optimal for the UNM assays to be performed by the same laboratory for the 24-month sample as was done for the baseline samples.  Thus, the ARP will have to provide the University of New Mexico investigators the resources to have the RIA tests performed for a sample of 700.  The proposed HEAL investigator, Dr. Richard Baumgartner's laboratory is the only group for the job because the samples reside in his laboratory and he was responsible for the collection of the samples.  Dr. Richard Baumgartner is Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico School of Medicine.  He is an internationally recognized expert in the field of body composition as it relates to chronic diseases and aging, with over 290 peer-reviewed publications.  He is the Principal Investigator of the New Mexico Health, Eating, Activity and Lifestyle (HEAL) Study, a cohort of breast cancer survivors; and the New Mexico Aging Process Study, a cohort study of body composition and disability in elderly men and women.  Dr. Baumgartner has established expertise in biomarker assays in epidemiological research, and his laboratory performed many of the hormonal assays for the HEAL Study.  .  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, September 15, 2004.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with the MedDRA Maintenance and Support Services Organization (MedDRA MSSO), Northrop Grumman Federal Civil Systems, Inc. located in Reston, VA, for the development, review, and testing of mappings between MedDRA and SNOMED CT©  as well as subject expertise relating to interpretation of MedDRA. The period of performance for this purchase order is one year with three successive one-year option periods.

NLM previously contracted with the College of American Pathologists (CAP) for a perpetual U.S.-wide license for its SNOMED CT vocabulary.  With advice from the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, the cross-agency Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) eGov initiative has designated SNOMED CT as one of a number of U.S. government-wide clinical data standards.  It is a major Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) priority to promote the adoption and use of these standards throughout the U.S.  To this end, HHS has given the NLM responsibility for funding, coordinating, and/or performing mappings between SNOMED CT and other important vocabularies (including those designated as administrative standards under the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)) and for working to align clinical vocabulary and messaging standards.  The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) and HHS have assigned a particularly high priority to the creation of robust mappings between SNOMED CT and several other vocabularies, including CPT, ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, MedDRA, and Medcin.

Under this acquisition, MedDRA MSSO shall: (1) Assist the development, review, and testing of mappings between MedDRA and SNOMED CT. a) Identify, jointly with NLM, other vocabulary producers, and representative users of mappings, the business case(s) to be addressed and the basic mapping parameters for mappings between MedDRA and SNOMED CT.  b) Work with the College of American Pathologists to prepare, as requested by NLM, initial mappings between MedDRA and SNOMED CT. c) Review and revise as appropriate mappings between MedDRA and SNOMED CT whether prepared by the Contractor or by another organization, to ensure that they accurately reflect the meaning and usage of MedDRA. d) Develop, jointly with NLM, other vocabulary producers, other relevant government agencies, and representative users, plans for testing, validation, revision, and ongoing maintenance of mappings between MedDRA and SNOMED CT. (2) Provide subject expertise relating to interpretation of MedDRA.

MedDRA MSSO is uniquely qualified to offer the above services.  The MedDRA MSSO was established by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA) to manage the MedDRA (the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) terminology.  The MSSO serves as the official repository, maintainer and distributor of MedDRA.  It is therefore the authority on the meaning and intended usage of MedDRA, on the current content and structure of this complex vocabulary, and on future plans for its development and extension.  The MedDRA MSSO must be involved in any project that related MedDRA to other standards to ensure that the results are definitive and credible.  Should the definition of relationships between MedDRA and other standards require alterations or adjustments in MedDRA content, the MedDRA MSSO is the only organization with the authority to make such changes.  Due to its unique role as the official repository, maintainer, and distributor of MedDRA, the MedDRA MSSO is the only organization capable of providing the services required.

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) procedures and awarded using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria: (1) Extensive and recent experience in creating and interpreting the content of MedDRA (2) The ability to effect changes in the content of MedDRA in response to requirements identified during the process of creating mappings between MedDRA and SNOMED CT.

Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-231/LMF shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Lynn Furtaw on 301-496-6546 or furtawl@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>Contractors provide air tanker aircraft to the USDA Forest Service (FS) that are fully operational and drop approved fire suppressant/retardant material on forest and range fires over all types of terrain.  These aircraft are operated continuously at low levels (typically 150 feet AGL) in steep mountainous terrain, and are subjected to highly turbulent environments and increased accelerations relative to the role for which the aircraft were designed.  A Structural Health Monitoring System (SHMS) designed by Systems & Electronics, Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Illinois, has been installed on part of the air tanker fleet, as well as the resulting data being evaluated.  The monitoring system is part of an on-going project to verify the airworthiness and structural life limits of the aging air tanker fleet.  The equipment used for data collection and the data gathered by that equipment must be uniform in content and format to be compatible with the existing SHMS in order to provide reliable, consistent, and accurate structural data analysis for the entire fleet throughout future years.  In order to maintain monitoring system compatibility and data reliability, the FS intends to acquire on a sole-source basis from Systems & Electronics, Inc., the installation of SHMS’s into the remaining seven (7) Aero Union P-3 Air Tankers, and the data processing of recorded flight data from one DC-7 Air Tanker and eight (8) P-3 air Tankers for a one-year period.  
Any offeror interested in submitting a technical proposal in response to this notice is invited to do so.  Proposals shall provide a complete explanation of how their proposed structural monitoring equipment and data collection and reporting capability is currently compatible in every way with the existing installed SHMS from Systems & Electronics, Inc.  Past performance information relative to the installation and evaluation of data from the proposed system is also required.  Please note that proposals received as a result of this notice will be considered only for the purpose of determining whether the proposed system is compatible and uniform to the Systems & Electronics, Inc. SHMS, and if so, whether or not it is possible to obtain an equivalent system through competitive processes.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) Pediatric Oncology Branch intends on entering into a sole source contract with Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030 for the acquisition of 390 tissue block samples.  This acquiistion is being conducted based on FAR 13.  The North American Industry Classification Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $10M.  The Pediatric Oncology Branch develops preclinical investigations and phase I/II clinical trials in pediatric patients.  Cancer drug discovery  is focused on identifying molecularly targeted drugs that are more selective and specific for proteins and signaling pathways directly involved in tumorigenesis.  Currently, the emphasis is on therapeutic targets present in common epithelial-derived adult cancers, which have a different pathogenesis than pediatric malignancies.  The acquisition of accurately diagnosed and appropriately characterized tissue samples and accuracy of the pathology report is vital to the success of the Pediatric Oncology Branch projects.  The Texas Children's Cancer Center was chosen for this project based on its reputation of it's pathology department, number of new cases of childhood cancer treated per year, willingness, collaboration and ability to provide support services necessary to obtain the required tissue blocks.  Texas Children's Cancer Center has the required pediatric oncologic pathology services that will permit the acquisition of appropriately characterized and diagnosed tissue blocks as well as a sufficient volume of specimens required to manufacture the proposed childhood cancer and plexiform neurofibroma tissue microarray for molecular target screening and clinical drug development.  Baylor College of Medicine is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the required pathology services to obtain the tissue block samples that can be used in the construction of specific array.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) RFQ-RT-04-00455.  EPA intends to negotiate a sole source Firm Fixed Price purchase order to Biomark of Boise, ID, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1-- The purpose is to establish a remote PIT-tag monitoring station for EPA Freshwater Habitat Research Project.  With this project, EPA seeks to examine the influence of landscape and watershed-scale human activities on the habitats and viability of freshwater fishes in coastal Oregon.  EPA research indicates Biomark is the sole provider of Destron-Fearing 12mm  "super" PIT tags and transceiver/antenna systems that are currently in use by this project and cooperators.  Therefore, Biomark possesses the unique ability and knowledge necessary to complete this project due to the familiarity with current PIT tag technology and no other would meet the EPA's  specifications other than the Destron-Fearing system marketed by Biomark.  For this project, Biomark will coordinate with EPA to (1) conduct a site visit to Winchester Creek near Charleston, Oregon to determine a specific suitable location for this project; (2) assemble and test in-stream antennas;  (3) install and test the multi-plexing transceiver on site; and (4) provide maintenance and operation site visits as necessary.  Any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit documentation to establish the potential of completing such work.  If no affirmative responses  are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Biomark.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based on responses to this notice is solely within the  discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. This notice is not a request for quotations.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part  13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541.  The anticipated award date is September 10, 2004.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attn:  Terri Shook (D143-01), 4930 Old Page Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.  Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the requirement.  Responses shall include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination  that competition is feasible.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  Submit offers on RFQ4090  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-21 . This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a small business concern (NAICS-339111). The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure, the following items: (1) DNA Engine Thermal Cycler Base (requires 1 alpha unit)- qty 4,  (2) 96-well Gradient Alpha unit, holds one 96-well plate or 96 x 0.2 ml tubes- qty 2, (3) 48/48 Dual Alpha Unit Holds 2 x 48 x .02 ml tubes-qty 2.  System requirements include a system that has no moving optical parts, instead of a scanning CCD camera, for optical measurements and a temperature gradient sample block, which allows for condition optimization in a single experimental run. These features are necessary to perform quantitative PCR and RT PCR experiments. These features are necessary because a continuous signal increases data quality (no moving optical parts) and condition optimization can be found in a single experimental run, (temperature gradient sample block). The DNA Engine Themal Cycler must be a continuous fluorescence detection system that utilizes a thermoelectric Peltier-Joule heat pump module for all heating and cooling operations with multi-sensor/multi-zone temperature control technology, thermal accuracy of 0.3C, well-to-well uniformity of 0.4C, accommodating 96 samples, in place or strip tube format, with optional programming of a thermal gradient of up to 24C, across the 96-well sample block, yielding less than 0.4C variation from the predicted temperature.  The research also requires a continuous fluorescence detection system that excites fluorescent dyes with absorption spectra in the 450 to 505 nm range, and optimized for dyes with emission spectra in the first channel of 533/20 nm range, and in the second channel 540-700 nm range.  Especially important is the capability to excite samples sequentially with 96 LEDs, and detect each signal via two photomultiplier tubes (PMT) individually, without any moving parts, in order to ensure robustness of data collection.  The Thermal Cyclers, including Alpha Units, will need to come with standard 2-year parts and labor warranty.  Government-designated personnel will address any problems noted directly to the contractor.  The procedures that will be used in awarding this contract will be by written quotations or solicitations. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) price, 2) warranty, 3) technical capability to meet required specifications.  The anticipated award date is September 16, 2004.   The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212.3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contractor Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items.  A completed copy of provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items must be included.  Copies of the aforementioned clauses are available upon request by telephone to Ms. Juareatha Greer at (301) 496-2607.  Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items. Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), 16th September 2004 to Juareatha Greer.  For delivery through the Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, Suite 2NE70, Room/2NE62E, MSC/4812, Bethesda, Maryland 20817-4812.  Electronic submission will not be accepted.  Requests for information concerning this requirement are to be addressed to Ms. Juareatha Greer (301) 496-2607.  Collect calls will not be accepted. By submission of an offer, the  offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

The software eliminates the need to complete backups of critical data within the off-hours backup window, and allows the Paperless Servers to create hardware-based complete copies of the Paperless data.

This is the only product available that can take advantage of the Microcode deployed with the EMC Storage Subsystem.  EMC has no authorized resellers of this product, or installation services.  The anticipated Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) description, and quantity are as follows: CLIN 0001: TimeFinder Software License including 12 months maintenance, QTY: 4 (four); CLIN 0002 TimeFinder OnSite Installation Services, QTY: 1 (one).  EMC is the only authorized dealer of this software and services known to the Government. The Government intends to purchase both TimeFinder and Install Services from the same vendor.  The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill this requirement.  A solicitation is NOT available.  Therefore, written and/or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation related to this announcement will not be honored. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Communications plans to procure on a sole source basis with Nielsen//NetRatings Inc., 890 Hillview Ct, Suite 300, Milpitas, CA 95035 for Internet audience analysis research on NCI’s Cancer.gov Web site.  As part of the NCI’s Congressional Mandate within the Public Health Service Act, the NCI must “continue and expand programs to provide physicians and the public with state-of-the-art information on the treatment of particular forms of cancers, and to identify those clinical trials that might benefit patients while advancing knowledge of cancer treatment.”  The NCI’s Cancer.gov Web site has emerged as an essential tool for disseminating cancer information to the public. NCI desires to obtain information which will help in its assessment of the usefulness, accessibility, and effectiveness of the Cancer.gov Web site. Consumer analysis and customer satisfaction are key components in gaining success in the online market. NCI is continually working to improve the way NCI online constituents are being served by identifying who those constituents are and how they are using Cancer.gov. NCI has general goals for improving customer satisfaction, such as:  1) Better understand the consumers visiting Cancer.gov and to understand how this compares and/or contrasts to users visiting other health or cancer-related content sites; 2)  Determine the impact of proposed Web site changes on customer satisfaction and their loyalty to the survey Web sites;  3) Respond more quickly and effectively to customers' changing demands, impacted by the ever-evolving Web environment;  4) Benchmark performance against the performance of Web sites from other agencies, departments, or companies; 5) Better understand user needs for health information and user motivations for seeking and using such information; and 6) Allocate resources to maximize return on investment. The NNR MegaPanel Survey provides NCI with the ability to get targeted information about the users of Cancer.gov and other health-related and cancer-related Web sites. In addition, utilizing the data from this unique panel allows for the NCI to triangulate this data with the other audience analysis information collected with NNR’s other tools.  This service delivers more than 35 predefined reports and user defined query capabilities featuring in-depth measurements of Internet user behavior at home, at work, and a home/work combination.  NNR provides custom research on an as-requested basis. Because NNR utilizes real-time data collection, an analysis of available data on a custom basis to meet specific needs can be produced.  NNR is the only company that utilizes a ‘pure’ random digit dialing (RDD) recruitment methodology to gain a representative sample/panel of Internet users.  Additionally, NNR has the ability to accurately measure at the ‘user level’ versus the ‘machine level.’ Because NNR panelists install software at the client level (versus tracking URLs at a server level), NNR can identify specific users and provide detailed information on individual user behavior.  NNR has the unique ability to provide this data unobtainable from other metric tools available to NCI. NNR uses a unique method of data collection that is based on a demographic model of U.S. Internet users. The model consists of a panel of volunteers that allow their Internet activity to be monitored and reported. The U.S. Internet panel is made up of 40,000 individuals in the private and business sectors of the United States. Unlike other metric applications NNR provides demographic information.  Nielsen//NetRatings is the only source known to the NCI that can provide Internet audience analysis research on NCI’s Cancer.gov Web site as described above.  This service is considered commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Molecular Imaging Program (MIP), plans to procure on a sole source basis a FLA5000 System from FujiFILM Medical system Inc. 419 West Av,. Stamford, CT 06902.  The MIP develops and tests new targeted imaging probes for the detection and characterization of cancer.  Scientists are developing novel imaging agents using MRI, optical, radionuclide and PET emitters or “beacons”.  One of the major new types of imaging probes is fluorescent optical imaging agents that can only be “excited” and detected with special cameras.  The program is developing a variety of new optical imaging probes linked to specific receptor-ligands that can be used in vivo and require special imaging cameras.  The FLA5000 System is the only scanning system that has a near infrared excitation laser (670 nm), which is exactly the wave length feasible for human use. The near infrared light is a unique light with approximately 670 nm wave length, which can penetrate deep enough to visualize deep within the human body.  Therefore, to apply newly-developed imaging agents to human study, we require optical readers that confirm the exact location of the imaging probe within tissue during the animal testing phase of development.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. FujiFILM Medical system Inc. is the only source known to the end user that is capable of providing a near infrared fluorescence scanning system for gross tissue that meets the above required specification.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 8, 2004.

The facility resources are accessible to all investigators at the NIH.  Additionally, MIF provides technical and material support for research activities conducted within the In Vivo NMR Research Center.  This upgrade of hardware and software will provide the NINDS Government owned MicroCAT II, micro computed tomography system with expanded image reconstruction capabilities.  The upgrade will provide the MIF with micro-CT image capabilities for almost any size data set including mice and rats, and a   shorter scan time which means shorter anesthetic procedures for the animals, and more time available on the machine for investigators to collect data. This real-time reconstruction engine from Imtek maintains the warranty on the current NINDS Government owned MicroCAT II scanner and through that, the continued successful and safe operation of the scanner.  The MicroCAT II CT manufactured by Imtek , Inc. is the only qualified vendor to provide service and upgrades for the MicroCAT II scanner.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source basis services for a Special journal issue of Nicotine and Tobacco Research on the topic of Internet delivered tobacco cessation interventions with the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, 7600 Terrace Avenue, Suite 203, Middleton, WI 53562.  This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The Tobacco Control Research Branch of the NCI has a prominent role in tobacco behavioral research.  The TCRB assists in the development of research opportunities and dissemination of the information garnered from specific research as it relates to tobacco usage in all its forms.  The articles to be published by the SRNT's journal in a special issue specifically relating to technology assisted treatment interventions will assist NCI and the TCRB disseminating information that was presented and discussed at two meetings of the Web Assisted Treatment Interventions group, and consequently, help advance the mission of the TCRB.  Publication:  The design and style of this special issue of Nicotine and Tobacco Research shall match previous special issues of the journal.  Thus, this issue will have the same appearance as regular issues except for the notation that it is a special supplement to the journal.  Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) is the only organization known that is responsible for producing Nicotine and Tobacco Research.  SRNT was a supporter of the "1st Web Assisted Tobacco Interventions Meeting", which stimulated research in Web based interventions for tobacco. Further, SRNT is uniquely qualified to prepare this special issue due to its experience with the format and procedures required by Nicotine and Tobacco Research journal.  Nicotine and Tobacco Research is the one of the worlds few peer-reviewed journals devoted exclusively to nicotine and tobacco research and is the only such journal to have published articles related to Web assisted treatment interventions.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, September 8, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-40160-NG.

<DESC>UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to implement the  On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR  Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed by OMB, and after  that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/bidders  will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.  Contractors who  already are registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) can get a  head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond what  ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available software database applications.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

Currently, United States Air Force aircraft maintenance stands are made of metal materials. Extensive amounts of manpower, equipment and time are expended for corrosion treating and repairing these maintenance stands. Transporting these stands also requires a substantial amount of airlift and sealift capacity for deployments. Conventional metal stands require periodic cleaning, repairs and refinishing due to the re-occurrence of corrosion. The AEFB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is or slightly modified to solve this problem.

	These attributes are desired requirements by the USAF:

1.	A platform height range adjustable from 36” to 144”
2.	A platform with a working area of approx. 46” x 78”
3.	36” wide steps facilitating ease of climbing with tools
4.	1200 lb load capacity on raised platform
5.	1100 lb total unit weight
6.	A simple elevation mechanism
7.	Able to withstand the rigors of towing and using in an all weather flight line environment

	These attributes are considered beneficial by the USAF:

1.	72” width (eliminates need for outriggers)
2.	Stackable in the stowed position (two high)
3.	No more than 1500 lbs total unit weight

The AEFB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and beneficial attributes of the USAF.
4.	Your interest to demonstrate your product using dummy data the AEFB provides.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 24 Sep 04 to TSgt Ron Newpher, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  TSgt Ron Newpher can be reached at (208) 828-3522, newpherrb@mountainhome.af.mil.   A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) solicited from the  Defense Information Systems Agency’s (DISA), Procurement and Logistics Directorate with its subordinate Defense Information Technology Contracting Organizations (PL/DITCO).  PL/DITCO is in the process of modernizing the processes and automated tools used to accomplish the PL/DITCO mission under the project name of Enterprise Business Modernization (EBM).  PL/DITCO serves as the procurement arm of DISA and has a world-wide operational presence with offices at DITCO-Scott, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois; DITCO-NCR, Falls Church, Virginia; DITCO-EUR, Sembach Air Base, Germany; DITCO-PAC, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; DITCO-SWA, Bahrain in Southwest Asia; and DITCO-AK, Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska.  All DITCO offices except DITCO-NCR are defense working capital funded.  NCR is funded by annual appropriations.  All DITCO offices acquire and account for information technology (IT) supplies and services required by the warfighter, military departments, DISA, and other DoD and Federal agencies.  IT services and equipment procured includes telecommunications services, networks, systems, point-to-point circuits, equipment and facilities, as well as computer technology requirements such as: hardware, software, maintenance, and support services.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2003, the organization processed over 35,000 new contracting actions while administering over 1 million on-going contracting actions and 2.4 million financial transactions.  PL/DITCO had revenues exceeding $2.7 billion.

In order to accomplish this large volume of transactions, PL/DITCO manages, operates, and in many cases, has developed, a group of complex software applications across a wide range of computing environments including mainframe, client/server and web. The current list of systems applications includes 11 mainframe applications, 47 client server applications and seven web applications.  These applications have evolved independently over time and do not adhere to a consistent architecture.   This inconsistency adversely impacts the cost of operations and maintenance, the ability for end-users to track requirements through the entire process, and the ability of the technical staff to accommodate changes in requirements.

The goal of the EBM project is to create a single integrated solution that is accessible worldwide, shares consistent data and processes, and provides accurate and easily retrievable information for all PL/DITCO contracting functions.   The solution will incorporate the mandated Federal/DoD e-Business applications and it will solve the data exchange interoperability gap between these applications.  The objective is an application tool suite that uses “business workflow” and net-centric movement of data between applications in order to eliminate manual data entry thereby increasing data accuracy and integrity of procurement and financial information.  Additionally, this solution will replace legacy applications that are no longer required or mandated by DoD for use across the Department or within specific domains associated with OSD’s Business Management Modernization Program.  The optimal solution will reduce the number of unique applications by 75% or more, thus reducing reconciliation problems between systems and reducing applications and recurring infrastructure operations and maintenance costs.  PL/DITCO plans to operate and maintain the proposed systems solutions by acquiring commercial support as an integrated performance package, utilizing current, internal IT support resources, or a combination of both that focuses on systems readiness, availability, and minimized training, personnel, and infrastructure support requirements.  Any candidate solutions shall include a total life cycle management program that capitalizes on available commercial support and an available service delivery environment that will best meet our requirements given a total life cycle management approach from design to decommissioning.

THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The following documents are part of this RFI and are available at the following web site https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp 1) Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO), dated 14 June 2004, 2) Chart, PL/DITCO As-Is EA Functional System View, dated June 2004, 3) Chart, PL/DITCO To-Be EA Functional View, dated June 2004 and 4) Chart, PL/DITCO To-Be EA Required Functions, dated June 2004.

<SUBJECT>70 -- High Performance Computing Resources for NOAA's R&D Requirements
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-ResearchDevelopmentHPCS
<RESPDATE>101204
<ARCHDATE>10272004
<CONTACT>William Voitk, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-713-0828 x185, Fax (301) 713-0806, Email william.voitk@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) anticipates acquiring an advanced high performance computing system (HPCS) to meet its research and development (R&D) computing requirements with possible options to accommodate unanticipated additional NOAA HPC requirements as well as the HPCS needs of other partner agencies. The new HPCS will replace or augment the current R&D HPCS platforms of NOAA's Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL) in Boulder, Colorado; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in Princeton, New Jersey; and the National Centers for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) located in Camp Springs, Maryland. The replacement system will be known as the NOAA R&D HPCS and will provide a primary resource needed to carry out NOAA's research mission. 

Increased computational power is essential for NOAA to meet its strategic goals related to weather, climate, air quality, coastal and ocean resource management, and national commerce support, thereby providing improved service to the public. In order to fulfill the objectives of contract award late in FY2005 and initial system delivery early in FY2006, NOAA will use the Department of Commerce's re-engineered acquisition process referred to as "Concept of Operations" or CONOPS, described in "Department of Commerce Acquisition Process Case for Change" (available from the CONOPS home page located at http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops). An R&D HPCS acquisition Team ("the Team") has been formed within the Department of Commerce, and a Project Agreement has been drafted between the Team and management to spell out the objectives, milestones, approach, budget and resources available for the project. The Project Agreement and associated documents describing this project are being made available on the Internet at the Project Web Site, http://rdhpcs.noaa.gov/ as they are completed. Interested parties should continue to monitor this web site for additional information concerning this project.

NOAA is seeking varied concepts and innovative approaches to obtain the needed computing system within the time frame and budget allocated. Publishing of the Project Agreement is intended to provide the high-performance computer industry with a general overview of the requirements, time frames and budget, as well as to open a formal communication channel between industry and the Team. The Team also is providing a draft Statement of Need (SON) on the Project Web Site, including information on how to obtain initial benchmark codes. The Team welcomes industry comments, questions and suggestions that will aid it in developing its acquisition strategy and finalizing the SON.
 
The probable budget for this acquisition is estimated to be as follows:

FY2006 - Base $3 million/Options $0-5 million
FY2007-Fy2014 - Base $22 million annually/Options $0-23 million annually

The Team will consider input received in response to this RFI as it continues to develop the SON and the Request for Proposals (RFP). The Team does not anticipate the need for a pre-proposal conference, but if one is deemed necessary, information will be posted on the Project Web Site.
The Team may conduct one-on-one communications with interested vendors in an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI.

Parties interested in providing information that the Team may use in developing the Government's technical or acquisition approach should review carefully the Project Agreement and supporting documents referenced in the draft Statement of Need, all of which are available at the Project Web Site.

One of the purposes of this RFI is to provide vendors with initial benchmark codes that will give an indication of the type of model programs that may be expected to run on NOAA's new R&D HPCS. A complete list of the major model programs and the proposed schedule is available at the Project Web Site. Instructions for obtaining the benchmark codes are available at the Project Web Site. The Team requests that vendors submit their benchmark test results with their RFI response. This will give NOAA an indication of the performance capabilities of each vendor's recommended computing resources. One of the principal outcomes of vendor/government dialog will be to ensure that viable approaches are considered during the competition. The Government may therefore utilize the information provided to refine its acquisition strategy to maximize competition among viable acquisition alternatives.

It is not the Government's intent to disclose vendor proprietary information and trade secrets to the public. The information submitted by vendors during the pre-solicitation period may be used by the Government in preparing its RFP and finalizing the SON, provided this can be done without disclosing proprietary vendor information that is protected from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations.

Interested vendors should respond in writing to the following topics. Recommended page lengths are identified in parentheses at the end of each question. Total response to this RFI should be limited to 14 pages, which provides flexibility to extend some answers beyond the recommended length, if needed. Vendors who submit written responses may be invited to augment their written responses with a 2- 3 hour oral presentation in late October or early November 2004. Vendors responding to this RFI and who are interested in making a presentation to the Team, please notify the Contracting Officer, William Voitk via E-mail (William.Voitk@noaa.gov) by September 15, 2004. The Team will make a decision on which vendors to invite to make presentations.

1.	Briefly describe the involvement your organization has had in providing HPC systems to your customers. Has your HPC involvement included weather/climate applications? Describe relationships you have or have had with particular HPC, storage, communications, software, and facilities providers in support of your HPC involvement. Any references you can provide would be appreciated. (1 page)

2.	Describe your organization's ability to provide engineering support to NOAA HPC users in the Washington, DC; Boulder, CO; and Princeton, NJ areas. (1/2 page)

3.	Describe any anticipated HPC technology developments (i.e. compute, storage, network) that NOAA should be aware of to ensure that our SON elicits the best responses from the vendor community. Has your organization had a role in HPC Grid applications? (1 page)

4.	 Describe the largest file size your system can handle now, whether this is a hardware or software limitation and projections for the largest file size during the base and option periods of performance (See section C.4.3 in the SON document). Describe any alternatives solutions to maximize file size and trade-offs compared with other solutions. Describe the largest number of inodes your filesystem can handle now and projections for the base and option periods of performance. Describe any alternatives solutions to maximize inode number and trade-offs compared with other solutions. (1page)

5.	The user profiles as identified in the SON show the majority of users located in 3 geographic areas with some additional remote users. What sort of bandwidth requirements would you expect the remote users to require? How would configurations comprising 1, 2, or 3 locations affect your system design and network bandwidth requirements? Identify the magnitude of any cost impact that could be expected in any given configuration. (1 page)

6.	NOAA is planning to conduct two concurrent procurements: one for Operations (a separate acquisition is being conducted by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to acquire two (primary and backup) high performance computer systems to be used by the National Weather Service in performing its operational weather and climate forecasting mission), and this one, for R&D. Do you plan to submit proposals for both? If so, what challenges or opportunities does this present to your organization? If not, why not? Are there any changes to the proposed schedule or approach that you would suggest to help your organization be more responsive? Note: Vendors are not required to submit proposals for both the R&D and Operations. (1/2 page)

7.	At this point in time, the Government has not identified sufficient government space to house the entire suite of equipment expected as a result of this procurement.  What effect will the availability (or lack of availability) of government space have on your ability to respond to an RFP? (1 page)

8.	The Government intends to offer vendors the flexibility to propose a consolidation of facilities or to provide a different geographical mix of functions than now exists.  Are you able to evaluate such alternatives including the changes in required support and high bandwidth communications? (1 page)

9.	As described in the SON, NOAA is transitioning from an organization-based approach to HPC to a new integrated approach along functional lines. Do you perceive any major problems with this approach or do you have any major concerns with the NOAA consolidated procurement for R&D? (1 page)

10.	Based upon your knowledge of NOAA's current Research and Development (R&D) procedures and configurations, are there technologies, available now and over the course of the base period (thru 2010), that would enable NOAA to better integrate it's R&D environment in such areas as: job scheduling, programming environment, data management, transitioning models from R&D to operations? (1 page)

11.	NOAA plans on including options to augment the R&D HPCS with incremental computational increases based on future unknown requirements. What would be your organization's ability and approach to responding to unanticipated requirements throughout the course of the contract? What would be the best way to include these requirements in the RFP to enable your company to develop a response? (1/2 page)

12.	If relevant, describe how possible outcomes of the SCO v. IBM lawsuit may affect the viability and cost of systems software that may be offered. (1/2 page)

13.	What issues do you face with respect to the individual benchmark applications NOAA has chosen for this procurement? Do you have any concerns about the approach including the number, variety of benchmark applications or the scope of the workstreams? (1 page)

14.	Do you understand the concept of "workstream" as described in the draft SON? Does the SON make it clear that one of the major goals of the acquisition is to optimize the throughput of each workstream? (1/2 page)

15.	NOAA plans on issuing a performance-based contract for the R&D HPCS. Describe any performance measures/incentives that you would recommend that NOAA incorporate into the contract. (1/2 page)


16.	What questions, recommendations or needs for additional information does your firm have in response to this RFI and draft SON that would help the Government prepare an RFP that your firm will be able to respond to effectively? (1 page)

The vendor's submission should reflect an understanding of NOAA's requirements for product delivery and an overall approach for providing the required capabilities. Multiple or alternative approaches are welcome. Although this RFI requests specific information, it is not intended to discourage innovative thinking on the part of industry to propose alternative solutions or approaches that the Team may not have considered.  Vendors responding should provide a point-of-contact, including: representative's name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number.  Benchmark results should be summarized according to the instructions included with the benchmark suite of applications.

Please prepare two (2) paper copies (double-sided) and one (1) ISO 9660 CDROM in PDF, formatted for 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheets, single-spaced with margins of one (1) inch on all sides. The type for all documents submitted (including charts and graphs) should be limited to fourteen (14) pages, not exceed twelve (12) characters-per- linear-inch or be smaller than twelve (12) point, and should not exceed six (6) lines-per-vertical-inch.

This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Program Executive Office-Ground Combat Systems, Program Management Office Stryker Brigade Combat Team (PM-SBCT) is conducting a market survey to determine the current availability of Tactical Navigation Systems for integration on Stryker vehicles. The purpose of the survey is to assist in determining what Non-Developmental Items are currently available. The Federal Acquisition Regulation defines a nondevelopmental item as follows: a. Any previously developed item of supply used exclusively for governmen tal purposes by a Federal agency, a State or local government, or a foreign government with which the U.S. has a mutual defense cooperation agreement. b. Any item described in paragraph a., above, that requires only minor modification or modifications of a  type customarily available in the commercial marketplace in order to meet the requirements of the procuring department or agency or c. Any item of supply being produced that does not meet the requirement of paragraphs a or b, above, solely because the ite m is not yet in use. Questions about this survey should be directed to the POC listed below who may post them to the TACOM web site at http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm with the answers. The government will not reimburse contractors for any costs incurred as a result of their participation in this survey. Submit survey documentation by email as well as a printed hard copy to the POC below no later than 30 September 04. All survey documenta tion must be in English. Proprietary data, if submitted, should be marked as such. If any portion of the survey response is classified, contact the POC provided below for instructions. Documentation provided will not be returned. Interested firms should fill out the questionnaire below. Your responses will assist in finalizing plans for this effort and allow better definition of requirements, thereby providing a more clearly written solicitation to industry. The Stryker currently hosts a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver (Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver or PLGR) to determine self-location and the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Command and Control (C2) system for battlefield situat ional understanding. However, the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) calls out for a 'position/navigation system' not a GPS receiver. The current ORD requirement for Stryker navigation is: The IAV must be able to host existing and future GPS capabilities into an integrated, self-contained, externally referenced positioning/navigation system. The accuracy of this system shall be sufficient to provide navigation position, velocity, heading, at titude, and time data for map displays, automatic position reporting, target location determination and communications reporting. RATIONALE: Provides the ability for soldiers to accurately determine their location and direction in accomplishing their mission. Accurate location on the battlefield is paramount in accomplishing their mission and providing situational understanding (situ ational awareness) to the commander. Situational understanding is also essential for soldiers to accomplish requirements stated in the IBCT Organizational and Operational concept. Accurate friendly position location helps avoid fratricide. Conceptually, PM BCT is looking for requirements similar to other Army combat vehicles. For example, from the Bradley M2/M3A3 ORD: Position Navigation System (PNS): The M2/M3A3 has a requirement for a PNS that consists of an inertial system or similar capability integrated with the global positioning system (GPS) to give the vehicle commander a backup navigation capability should the GPS fail. The GPS will update the inertial system continuously. Provisions for a m anual update to the inertial system are also required. The PNS will provide readouts at the driver, commander, and squad leader stations. The PNS will also provide directional capability. The driver will have a display that presents all the navigational in formation normally displayed by a GPS, i.e. azimuth 'drive to', distance, steer left or right etc, etc. The Driver display will also have the input function for entering and selecting waypoints (destinations) in the PNS. The accuracy of the 'drive to' head ing should be plus or minus 3 degrees (1 degree desired) for the driver. Should the GPS fail, the inertial system will provide the commander with his present location and a directional capability. The PNS will be integrated with the command and control sys tem and update the system with the vehicles position every 5 seconds. The PNS will also be integrated with the fire control systems to allow target hand-off to other weapon systems. RATIONALE: The PNS greatly enhances the crews navigation capability as well as their ability to pinpoint and identify friendly vehicles and positions and enemy targets. Identification of friendly vehicles and positions will reduce the incidents of fratric ide while increasing situational awareness. The ability to pinpoint targets will enable the crew to call for accurate supporting fire on enemy positions and vehicles without delay. The PNS interface supports the command and control capability to pass target and friendly troop information to other vehicles througho ut the combined arms force. This further reduces incidents of fratricide while adding to the lethal effects of the combined force. Accuracy of the 'drive to' heading should be plus or minus 3 degrees (1 degree desired). A 3-degree error will mean that the driver will only be off approximately .5 kilometers after driving a 10-kilometer course. A 1-degree error is desired to reduce the error to 170 meters after driving 10 kilometers. This puts the M2/M3A3 close enough to stay within boundaries or to hit an ob jective. The navigation system is expected to be fielded on both Stryker variants MGS (Mobile Gun System) and ICV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) as well as all 9 ICV configurations of the ICV - Commanders Vehicle or CV, Anti-Tank Guided Missile or ATGM, Mortar Carrie r or MC, Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Reconnaissance Vehicle or NBCRV, Engineer Squad Vehicle or ESV, Medical Evacuation Vehicle or MEV, Fire Support Vehicle or FSV and Reconnaissance Vehicle or RV. Over one thousand Strykers have been ordered si nce the program start and another one thousand are to be fielded by FY08. Each Stryker configuration will have its own set of integration issues; however hardware and software commonality shall be maximized. The system must have low power consumption, be l ight in weight, and require a small space claims. Power, weight and space restrictions are critical on each Stryker vehicle. A solicitation is expected to be issued in the FY06 to FY08 timeframe. All this is contingent on funding becoming available. Deliverables for the survey could include: x Technical descriptions of systems that meet the above requirements x Interface Control Documents (ICDs) for the recommended systems (Adobe, Visio format) o	Electrical and mechanical interfaces o	Physical, size, weight, volume and power requirements o	System and environmental specifications x Schedule of existing or planned production of recommended products x Computer Aided Design (CAD) models or mockup of products (AutoCAD, Pro/E or equivalent format) x Identify if there are any available systems for PM BCT to perform space claim, weight and power analysis. x Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) on Unit cost, with quantity discount costs Original Point of Contact Edward Ottman, (586) 753-2147 Email your questions to TACOM  Warren to ottmane@tacom.army.mil Place of Performance Address:	Commander, United States Army Tank-automotive and Armamen ts Command Postal Code: 48397-5000 Country:	US Market Survey Questionnaire for Tactical Navigational System Your cooperation in answering these questions is greatly appreciated.

Did Any One Call for Security? Federal Security Clearance Required

Moderator: TDB
Presenter: Chad Stacker

Doing business with the government often requires that companies provide personnel with clearances to access classified information.  In order to provide cleared personnel, the company itself must be cleared by the government.  Once it is cleared, it must abide by the rules and regulations of the National Industrial Security Program (NISP).  This session will provide an overview of the NISP in general, and it will focus on the facility clearance process in particular.  We will address questions such as which comes first, the contract or the clearance; my employees have clearances, can they access classified information even though my company is not cleared; and who must request that my company be cleared, and how do they do that?

 


The U.S. Small Business Administration is working to help small businesses obtain more contracts from government and industry. While driving contracts to small businesses will strengthen our economy, it will also help organizations like yours achieve small and minority business contracting goals. Contracts that develop from meetings held at the Business Matchmaking events will be our measure of success.

Business Matchmaking Event

The matchmaking events provide a unique opportunity for small businesses to present product and service solutions to buyers through prescheduled one-on-one appointments with procurement managers.  The event is NOT an opportunity to trade business cards, as is the case with traditional trade shows. Instead it is a REAL chance for small businesses to meet with public and private organizations for procurement opportunities. Through these matchmaking events we anticipate small businesses competing for millions of dollars in contracts from the private and public sector. 

What do the events include?

•   One-on-one pre-set appointments between suppliers (small businesses) and buyers (federal/state/local government agencies and private organizations) for 15 minutes per meeting.

•   Educational sessions covering a variety of topics (for example: how to qualify to contract with the federal government, how to gain access to capital, how to start/expand trading internationally, and more...).

•   Federal, state, local government and private industry representatives on site to discuss services, such as SBA financing, federal qualification requirements, minority and women-owned business tools and more. 
 
How will the appointments be established?

Buyers will supply their commodity buying needs and small businesses will provide their profile information. Matches will be established based on the NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) codes each party provides.  Small Business Administration will schedule Individual 15-minute appointments with buyers and small businesses who match their NAICS code.  To help ensure meaningful appointments, small businesses will be unable to schedule meetings with buyers who don't match the firms NAICS code.

Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)     The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships.     For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>NOTICE TO OFFERORS

The Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic, Naval Engineering Division will be implementing the SSPC QP 1 in solicitations issued on and after October 1, 2004.  The proposal was posted to FEDBIZOPPS in July 2004 through August 13, 2004.  The industry and ship repair companies provided few comments.  To provide background to our pool of offerors, the below is provided as background and notification of the upcoming change.

Proposal to Implement Painting Contractor Certification Program (PCCP)
Adapted from an article by Mr. Paul Beausejour, Naval Engineer
USCG, Naval Engineering Division, Norfolk, VA (2004)
Background.
Historically, the Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCA) has been plagued with pre-mature coating failures on surfaces deemed “critical-coated” surfaces i.e. bilges, u/w body surfaces, potable water tanks, flight deck surfaces, etc…Such coating failures typically lead to a loss of cutter operational days and increase contract costs.  When confronting pre-mature coating failures, in most cases, MLCA is dealing with smaller type shipyards. As a result of careful investigating, these failures are often attributed to a lack of Quality Control (QC) in said yards.
What we have done and are doing.
MLCA has attempted to remedy this problem by including a variety in-process quality control requirements in coating specifications; in addition, over the past 5 years, one of our main efforts has been that of requiring contractors to hire Technical Representatives/Coating Inspectors, who are professionally trained (at a minimum), to the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) coating Inspector Session I., to oversee all aspects of critical coating applications.  Unfortunately, due in part to the difficulty of enforcement in the field, this effort has been, largely, unsuccessful.  An additional contributing factor is contractor use of free technical services from coating manufactures - a practice recently prohibited in our specifications.
What we propose as a next step.
As is currently required by NAVSEA and various other major facility owners, the next logical step, in addressing this problem, is to require contractor certification.  In our view, the Painting Contractor Certification Programs (PCCP), developed and managed by the Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC), would be the appropriate certifying medium.  The SSPC programs are based on consensus standards developed by a diverse committee of industry professionals; they are nationally recognized independent contractor evaluation programs.  They are also a handy pre-qualification tool, developed by SSPC, for facility owners and others who hire industrial painting contractors.  Among several of the certification programs, the “QP-1” program, at a minimum, involves reviewing the painting contractors’ primary ability to provide quality work (surface preparation and protective coating application), and assessing contractor conformance with applicable safety, health and environmental compliance standards.
Certification particulars.
Initial certification costs are between $5000 and $7500; annual renewal is required at a minimal cost to the contractor.  Consequences for certified contractors who violate established safety, quality, environmental, and or ethical practice standards of performance include (but are not limited to) the following:  warnings, probationary periods, suspensions or revocation of certification by the SSPC.
Enforcing the PCCP requirements.
The MLCA recognizes the importance of maintaining a broad contractor base.  In fact, as part of the PCCP implementation, we would actively engage contractors by providing advance notification of intent to use the “QP-1” program as a qualifying factor.  Specifically, all prospective bidders for preservation work for the aforementioned critical-coated surfaces could expect advance notice of six months to one year  to facilitate their compliance efforts. The notice would read was follows:
”Notice To Contractors:  This is to advise all concerned parties that all Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCA) commercial availability projects advertised on or after 01 October 2004 will require that any contractors engaged in surface preparation and coating application be certified by SSPC to the requirements of SSPC-QP 1, prior to contract award.   The MLCA retains the option of including these requirements in any projects advertised prior to the listed date above.  Information on the SSPC certification programs can be found at www.sspc.org”.
The vessel procurement branch (vpl) would enforce the PCCP requirements in a manner that is fair and equitable.  Rules for certification and re-certification have been established by SSPC to provide a reasonable amount of time for all parties to perform the required tasks; however, SSPC can provide temporary extensions where "good-faith" efforts have not succeeded in fulfilling all requirements.  The policy of enforcement of the basic PCCP requirement, initially, and for fostering continuous certification would be as follows:
·	Contractors would be allowed to work during their certification period only.
·	Upon expiration of the certification, work would be stopped and would re-start only upon presentation of a valid certification, or written certification extension, from SSPC.
·	No grace period would be allowed and liquidated damages would not be waived for non-performance due to expired certification.
Placing Requirement for PCCP in Project Specification.
At the time of implementation, the “General Requirements” item would be amended with a paragraph that conveys the intent of PCCP implementation; it would read as follows:
“All contractors and subcontractors that perform surface preparation or coating application shall be certified by the Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC) to the requirements of SSPC QP 1 prior to contract award, and shall remain certified while accomplishing any surface preparation or coating application.  The painting contractors and painting subcontractors must remain so certified for the duration of the project.  If a contractor's or subcontractor's certification expires, the contractor will not be allowed to perform any work until the certification has been reissued.  Requests for extension of time for any delay to the completion of the project due to an inactive certification will not be considered and liquidated damages will apply. Notify the KO of any change in contractor certification status”.
Conclusion.
The SSPC certification programs would offer the MLCA the advantage of knowing that the industrial painting contractors who are working on its projects have the experience, knowledge and equipment to produce quality work in accordance with the local, state and federal guidelines for safety, health and environmental compliance.

<DESC>This is amendment number 01 to the combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services previously posted – The purpose of this amendment is to identify questions received and provide all interested parties with the Government’s response.


The following is a list of questions received and the Government’s responses.

1.  What countries are to be covered in the contractor’s response, i.e. the proposed web    solution should cover which countries?

Answer:  The contractor response is to address all fifty of the United States of America only, no territories or foreign countries.  


2.  For the requirement, “zoom-able map, and driving directions”, which geographic regions must the system support (all USA states and territories)?

Answer:  It should include the United States; all 50 states, no foreign countries or territories.


3.  Define Transactions as described in the RFQ.  Is each transaction defined as a mouse or keyboard click (e.g. each zoom in/out or geocode is considered a separate transaction)?  Or each time a provider is located, that is considered a transaction (follow on map navigation is part of the first transaction)?

Answer:  The request for providers with a response showing the list of providers meeting the selection criteria, displaying the information in sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the RFQ.  Scrolling from one page to another is not considered as a separate transaction.

Each set of map and/or driving directions for one provider.  Zooming in and zooming out as well as jumping from one map section to another is not considered as a separate transaction.  Scrolling from one page to another is not considered as a separate transaction.


4.  Provide an estimate on the average number of daily updates.

Answer:  The average number of provider updates is 462,500 per month.  Daily updates vary.  If you assume a 21 day month, the average would be about 22,000 per day.


5.  Is there an incumbent on this contract?  What is the name of the company currently doing the work?  What was the dollar value of the previous contract?

Answer:  No.  This is a first time buy, so there is no previous contract or contractor.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: 

1. Specifications:  Coatings:  Two (2)-Part Polyurethane.  Is this the coating that will be used to spray painting objects in the booth or is it a finish you want on the booth?  If it pertains to the finish of the booth is white acceptable and can it be powder coated in lieu of Two (2)-Part Polyurethane?  Powder coating is superior to a two (2)-part Polyurethane.

ANSWER: This is the type of Paint we will be spraying.

2. Specifications:  Electrical Requirements: Power: 208V 3PH 60Hertz; Control: 110V 1PH 60 Hertz. Class 1 Div 1 within 3? of all openings and inside booth. All electrical work will meet or exceed NEC-1999 edition. NOTE: Available voltage at panel is 230V 3PH 60 Hertz."  Electrical requirements states 208V / 3PH / 60 HZ and the available is 230V / 3 PH / 60HZ.  Which is it?

ANSWER: Available voltage for the booth is 230V / 3 PH / 60 Hz

3. Specifications require  -Air makeup unit will provide a minimum of 16,800 CFM but may go as high as 19,200 CFM. Contractor will require load balancing  since there are no temperature specifications and no stated fuel to provide heat is it correct that Air Make Up is to be ambient air temperature?  If yes then it is no more than a supply air fan.  If exhausting 16,800 CFM then the inlet air should be the same or else excess air will be pushed out of the building through any available opening.  This can make it hard to open or close doors (based on door swing) in or out when the building is pressurized.  This can become a safety hazard or violation of Life Safety.

ANSWER: Ambient Air Temperature is correct.  As far as the air requirements go. "16,800 CFM but 
may go as high as 19,200 CFM" This is the correct airflow required. No Safety hazards should be posed because of the Air inlet area.

4. Specification states: -Front entrance lockable by user from inside booth.  Not legal as it would keep aid/help from reaching operator in the event of an emergency.  Are you just describing a latch that is Factory Mutual Approved (FM) for keeping the doors closed or are you describing some other a device?  Please clarify.

ANSWER: Doors should be lockable from inside, Factory latch is acceptable...There is a side door for alternate entrance.

5. Specifications reference LP is this a typo and should read HVLP?

ANSWER: LP refers to low-pressure air.

6. Is compressor existing or are we providing a new compressor?  Not
clear either way.

ANSWER: Compressor is to be provided as stated in the request 

7. Specification states:  "Installed Air: Base provided LP(HVLP?) air will be piped into booth with a pressure regulator mounted outside of paint booth. Is the Base doing this work or is this the base bid to provide and install?

ANSWER: The bases LP air will have to be contracted to be run into the booth

8. Who is responsible for connection of utilities to new points of
connection including fire suppression?

ANSWER: Contractor

9. Fume Monitor: Fume monitor able to signal user inside of booth of escaping paint fumes.  With a properly designed and installed paint spray booth fumes are evacuated from the enclosure by means of a powered exhaust system.  This is a non-pressurized paint booth as the specifications indicate -Inlet air filters incorporated into front entrance of booth or side of booth capable of filtering shop dust and dirt from entering the paint spray booth. Most booth manufacturers provide an air solenoid valve to be interlocked to the exhaust system to prevent paint spraying unless the exhaust system is turned on.  I believe you want a booth with an interlock to prevent paint spray operations unless the ventilation system is turned on.

ANSWER: A sensor would still be wanted for the outside to signal user of any escaping fumes.

10. Are we to furnish a new Air Make-Up Unit or just balance the existing unit.

ANSWER: Balance existing Air makeup unit

11. Inside the Spray booth is considered Class 1 Div 1. Three ft from any door is considered Class 1 Div 2. The area of three ft. is considered transitional, and as such you keep electrical wiring and equipment out of this zone. For enclosed spray booths the lighting fixtures are rated Class 1 Div 2 Groups A,B,C,&D. Class 2 Div 2 Groups F & G. The existing light fixtures on the existing booths meet these standards as I remember. They are not Class 1 Div 1. The room where the paint booth is located is not rated for explosion proof given the wiring that is in the room. If these are the design parameters no further explanation is required. The only time we were required to meet Class 1 Div 1 requirements for the room (outside the spray booth) was where they were painting bombs.

ANSWER: Class 1 Div 1 inside the booth and within 3 ft of any openings is all that is required.  

12. Fume Monitor. Is one pick-up for the room sufficient for the fume Monitor?

ANSWER: Fume monitor is an optional item and should be bid as such.  

13. Is a compressor part of the solicitation? Is CO2 monitoring device part of the solicitation? Fire Suppressant System?

ANSWER: The compressor, CO2 Monitor and Fire suppressant system are all to be furnished by the bidder . The Fume monitor (For Polyurethane)  is to be an optional item and bid as such.

14. Vertical or Horizontal mounting configuration? Indoor or outdoor location? How far will air make up unit be located from paint booth? Fuel source - propane or natural gas? Available gas pressure? What degree of temperature rise is required? Is unit to be single speed or two speed (with cure cycle). If two speed, what is desired cure cycle temperature? Will discharge air from air make up unit be ducted directly into paint booth or just into the building. The spec says the booth is to have filter doors. If this is accurate, that means air make up unit will discharge into the building, not directly into the booth.2. The specification says the booth is to have locking door. This is in direct violation of OSHA requirements for panic escape doors in painting environment. Please clarify. 3. Is contractor to provide fire suppression system as part of bid on booth? 4. Is air compressor to be provided as part of bid on booth? Is yes, where is compressor to be located relative to paint booth? 5. Bid states base will provide low pressure compressed air supply drops to booth? 

ANSWER: Contractor is to balance existing air makeup unit.. The door does not have to lock, it just needs a latch to prevent personnel from opening the door while paint is being sprayed. Contractor is to provide fire suppression system as part of booth. Contractor is to provide air compressor for booth and included in bid. Compressor will be located within the same vicinity of the Paint Booth but exact location has yet to be determined until type of compressor is known. Contractor is to plump the existing base low pressure into the booth for connections.

15. Do you have an approved contractor for the Fire Suppression System?

ANSWER: The bidding contractor will have either subcontract hookup of fire suppression system or do it themselves.

16. Can you accept a booth wider and longer than what was called out in your specs. 

ANSWER: The size of the both can be no longer or wider due to space limitations

17. Who is supplying the air makeup unit?

ANSWER: The air makeup unit is existing and only needs to be load balanced with the new booth.

18. Fume monitor, are you taking about a LEL alarm for Group C Solvents

ANSWER: Fume monitor is optional and should be bid as such Should be able to sense polyurethane paint fumes escaping from booth.

19. What type of fuel will the air make up unit be (LP, natural, electric)? Where is the air make up unit to be installed (roof, ground level)? Is the air make up unit to discharge the air in to the room where the booth is or directly in to the paint booth.  Is the fire suppressant system to hooked up to the existing building fire system. 

ANSWER: Air makeup unit is existing...  Only needs to be load balanced. The first suppressant system will have to tied into the existing system as the current one currently is.

<DESC>The following questions (Q) and answers (A) are provided.  Nothing not stated in this amendment changes, and proposals are still due as stated.  (Q)1.  Are you concerned with some resistance change of NbTi wires between room T and 4 K? It will be level dependent even inside the vacuum tube.  (A)1.  Yes,  a dependence of line resistance on He level is undesirable. 
(Q)2.  There can be a hybrid solution of manganin twisted pairs/NbTi pairs, with an intermediate terminal at either IVC flange (inside vacuum space) or  1 K pot.  (A)2. The proposed hybrid solution is attractive with a warmer manganin and a colder NbTi section.
Regarding D subminiature and MDM connectors: 
(Q)3. Vendor preference; (A)3.  We have no vendor preference on D subminiature connectors.  We emphasize that we are open to any solution for the room temperature connectors that is both hermetic (i.e. vacuum tight) and readily compatible with RF filtering.   (Q)4.  Any special options, like materials involved?  (A)4.  We have no vendor preference on MDM connectors for the cold end of the DC wiring.  Metal connector shells are highly desirable.  A dielectric compatible with mK temperatures is desirable.  Epoxy strain-relief of the wires at the back end of the connector is desirable.
(Q)5. Three additional ports – should they have tubes running through the helium space?  (A)5. Yes. 
(Q)6. In Option 0006 - do you mean to occupy one of this additional ports? (A)7.  Yes. 
(Q)8.  In Option 0008 do you mean “to allow wiring for Option 0007”?  (A)8.  Yes, there is a typo.  It should read to allow wiring for Option 7. 
(Q)9.  If yes, what do you choose for micro-coax?   Can we suggest SS in SS braid, 50 Ohm impedance micro-coax?   (A)9.  Yes, SS is reasonable for the micro-coax. 
(Q)10.   Will you accept manganin in CuNi shield twisted pair for thermometry (our normal way)?  (A)10.  Manganin is acceptable for the thermometry wiring. For the DC experimental wiring of option 7, NbTi is preferred because of the lower resistance below 4 K.
(Q)11.  Please confirm you need "Light-tightness" inside the 60 mK rad-shield only, or you want it to start from IVC, then Still rad-shield, and 60 mK rad-shield.   (A)11.  We need light-tightness at each shield stage: IVC, still, and especially 60 mK.
(Q)12.  Please confirm that 60 DC wires (30 pairs) are needed. (A)12. We would like 60 pairs (120 wires).

Not sure the vendor needs to see a CDC at this point.  Our CDCs are multi volume (usually 3) paper-based courses.  They are B&W with still graphics, some foldouts and schematics. Each Unit has self-check short answer questions and the answers are provided in the back of the book. Our AFIADL website has a catalog that describes the courses.

 

3. It seems that AFIADL already has a Learning Management System and 

Content Repository.  Is it assumed that the e-CDC system would leverage 

that infrastructure?

 

Yes.

 

4. Has AFIADL coordinated their e-learning architectures with other 

agencies?

 

Our systems are conformant to OSD's ADL specifications and standards:   www.ADLnet.org

 

5. The SOW specifies a task to recommend R&D priorities for e-CDC.  Is 

this development oriented? Is it separate from other AFIADL R&D?

 

Not sure at this point.  Vendor will have discretion to recommend what needs to be studied and evaluated in the future based on findings.

    I.  OLD BUSINESS
1. A site visit was held on 21 Jul 04 at 1000 at building 1600.  Two vendors were present.  TSgt Amos gave a brief overview of the project.  Contractors are to raise the systems furniture and remove and install carpet in the areas specified.  As stated in the SOW the work would be done at night between the hours of 1600 and 2400.  No work permitted on the weekends.  Mr. Hall the end user, will provide temporary passes for the crew.  Security Forces personnel will be escorts for the crew.  TSgt Amos instructed the individuals that any questions they have would need to be sent in writing by Tuesday 27 Jul 04.  She would accept e-mailed or faxed questions.  
      
2. Mr. Hill walked the individuals through the areas and indicated the areas where
work will be performed.  A vendor tested a piece of carpet and found that it was 
a quick release.  Mr. Hill stated the Government will deliver the carpet in small quantities to for convenience.  The contractor has to communicate how much work can be done in 8 hour periods.  There will be a storage area in the building for the carpet.

3. A vendor asked about the flexibilty in the communication lines in regard to lifting the systems furniture.  They were concerned that the lines are taunt and would be damaged.  Mr. Hill stated that the communication lines come from the ceiling and not the floor so there would be no problem but he would double check the location of all the lines.

4. Mr. Hill stated he would have to check and find out if the Commander’s corridor is included in the work. The vendors asked if there were any drawings to scale available for this project?  Mr. Hill said that they would check with CE.  TSgt Amos would check too.  The small drawing provided at the visit would be scanned and uploaded so everyone would have access to it.

5. A vendor stated that the project performance period of 60 days was too short with the amount of furniture that had to be moved during the short hours.  He would address this in his questions.

6. A vendor asked if a second site visit could be scheduled so his systems furniture subs could view the site and provide an estimate.  He said that he could not determine the amount of furniture to be moved in the package he received.  TSgt Amos asked the vendor to put his request in writing and said that she would look into the possiblity of another site visit.

This concluded the site visit.

<DESC>Site Visit Questions & Answers:

Questions for Bldg. 1600 Remove and Install Carpet

 

Is it possible to set up another site visit? Yes, 28  July 2004 @ 0930
 

Will the contractor be able to place a dumpster in the rear of the building?

 Dumpster placement -- we'll have to take a closer look as the time approaches.    At this point in time I don't believe so.  I have 1 contractor dumpster in place at the moment for a long-term project (Mar 05) plus our normal daily use dumpster for the building.  I have no space to put another one close enough to the dock entrance.

 

Can you provide access to a scaled set of drawings?   The current drawing is all we have at the moment. Please contact POC listed for an email or fax copy due technical difficulty the drawing can not be posted at this time. 

What are the wage rates for this project? Wage determination used for this requirement is stated in initial posting  WD may be accessed at https://www.ceals.usace.army.mil/netahtml/srvc.html

After reviewing the SOW I found that there is no stated performance period.  
  
What is the actual performance period? Performance Period is 60 days  after contract award
 

Will the contractor be able to stockpile a few days of material on-site?

Stockpile a few days materials on site -- I have space for a small conex type container which the contractor will need to provide and place for forward deployment of materials if he so wishes.  I do not have room in the building to stockpile much except maybe some carpet tiles.
 

At the end of every night does the contractor have to put all of the furniture back on the floor, or are we allowed to leave it suspended?

Replacement of furniture at the end of each night.  Yes.  Once an area is completed, the furniture needs to be placed back so it can be used.  The goal of this process is to create the minimum disruption to the operations in each area as possible.  If left suspended, it will cause operational disruption to the staff and they will be unable to work during the day until the furniture has been lowered.  If this is not possible, I need to know ASAP.

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s);

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The United States has sought to assist Mongolia's movement toward democracy and market-oriented reform and to expand relations with Mongolia primarily in the cultural and economic fields.  The United States granted Mongolia most-favored-nation status and has supported Mongolia's transition to political democracy and a market economy.   In support of this commitment, Mongolia was granted permanent NTR status and GSP eligibility in June 1999.   The U.S. also is directly supporting Mongolia's democratization by working with U.S. nongovernmental organizations to provide training for parliamentary committee organization and constituent service and has recently launched a program to establish public affairs organizations and legislative relations offices in every ministry.  

Mongolia has made great progress toward its transition to a market based system since the early 1990s.  Until 1990, the Mongolian economy was strictly based on the centrally planned model that had been adopted almost six decades earlier.  To accelerate the transition process the Government of Mongolia launched a series of reforms starting in 1991.  These reforms included: the phased liberalization of state-controlled prices and tariffs, privatization of state owned enterprises, establishment of a two-tier banking system, liberalization of foreign trade, adoption of a floating exchange rate system, implementation of tight monetary and fiscal policies aimed at reducing inflation, adoption and enforcement of laws to encourage fair competition, and creating a favorable environment for private sector development.  

The successful undertaking of initial steps in the transition to the market economy enabled positive economic growth in the last 9 years and reduction of the inflation rate to the single digit levels.  Due to restructuring and privatization programs the scale of the private sector expanded, comprising today around 75 percent of GDP.  Macroeconomic stability has been observed in the last several years, however, real economic activities remain fragile, especially from external economic changes.  

Currently, a total of 94,682 hectares have been given to companies and enterprises under 527 licenses to develop Mongolia’s minerals, of which 28,000 hectares are being exploited for the mining production. Mongolia’s current coal production is approximately 5 million metric tons, which is mostly consumed by domestic power producers.  The country is estimated to have potential reserves of 125 billion metric tons.  Many of these reserves have been proven, but remain undeveloped due to a lack of infrastructure.  Such reserves include the huge Tavantolgoi deposit in the Gobi, which contains over 5,000 million metric tons of coking and steam coal, but lies more than 400 kilometers from the nearest railway.  As such, there remains tremendous opportunity for USTDA to provide a catalyst for increased production of minerals throughout Mongolia.  However, it is necessary to have an independent consultant review the particulars of these projects to determine where U.S. companies would be most competitive in the sale of goods and services for such projects.  

In order to successfully undertake this project, the DM contractor shall organize a meeting with the Mongolian Embassy in Washington, D.C. to obtain contact information of appropriate people to meet while in Mongolia.  Further, the Embassy has agreed to organize assistance while in Mongolia by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.

In addition, the Definitional Mission Contractor shall recommend those projects, if any, identified during the visit that are not stated above with the appropriate supporting documentation that will allow for an informed decision on the part of USTDA on whether to support the project.

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE
The United States has sought to assist Mongolia's movement toward democracy and market-oriented reform and to expand its relations with Mongolia primarily in the cultural and economic fields.  The United States granted Mongolia most-favored-nation status and has supported Mongolia's transition to a political democracy and a market economy.   In support of this commitment, Mongolia was granted permanent NTR status and GSP eligibility in June 1999.   The United States is also directly supporting Mongolia's democratization by working with U.S. nongovernmental organizations to provide training for parliamentary committee organizations and constituent services.  Mongolia has also recently launched a program to establish public affairs organizations and legislative relations offices in every ministry.  
Mongolia has made great progress toward its transition to a market based system since the early 1990s.  Until 1990, the Mongolian economy was strictly based on the centrally planned model that had been adopted almost six decades earlier.  To accelerate the transition process the Government of Mongolia launched a series of reforms starting in 1991.  These reforms included: the phased liberalization of state-controlled prices and tariffs, privatization of state owned enterprises, establishment of a two-tier banking system, liberalization of foreign trade, adoption of a floating exchange rate system, implementation of tight monetary and fiscal policies aimed at reducing inflation, adoption and enforcement of laws to encourage fair competition, and creating a favorable environment for private sector development.  
The successful undertaking of these initial steps in the transition to a market economy enabled positive economic growth in the last 9 years and a reduction in the inflation rate to the single digits.  Because of restructuring and privatization programs, the scale of the private sector expanded, comprising around 75 percent of GDP today.  Macroeconomic stability has been observed in the last several years, however, real economic activities remain fragile, especially from external economic changes.
The transport sector has played a very important role in the development of Mongolia, which is unique with its vast territory and sparsely settled population.  The Mongolian transportation sector consists of 4 sub-sectors, namely road transport, railway transport, air transport and water transport.  In 2002, volumes of freight and number of passenger traffic were 13529.9 thousand tons and 105.7 million persons, respectively.  Compared to the previous year, volume of freight and number of passengers increased by 14.6 percent and 7.3 percent, respectively. 
Sparse population and severe weather conditions during winter have limited the development of surface transportation by road and railway in Mongolia.  As a result, air transport plays an important role in ongoing socio-economic activities in Mongolia.   The lack of an adequate transportation infrastructure to connect Ulaanbaatar (the Capital) with the regional centers would greatly hinder tourism, a key sector. 
In order to achieve the Mongolian Civil Aviation Authority’s goals and to adhere to its mission statement, the MCAA has been requested by the government to upgrade the Ulaanbaatar International Airport.  As part of that upgrade, the MCAA will need to re-equip the domestic fleet for Mongolian Airlines (MIAT), with more modern, economical and efficient western aircrafts.  Included in these projects will be the upgrading of the aviation security system to ensure that it is capable of meeting international standards in this important area.  The Mongolian Government’s policy on the development of the civil aviation sector is to accelerate the participation of the private sector, downsizing the governmental monopolization and supporting foreign investment and cooperation.  
In addition, the history of the Mongolian Railway dates from 1938, when a 43 km long railway was built between Ulaanbaatar and Nalaikh.  Currently, Mongolian Railway comprises two separate railways, the Trans-Mongolian main line, which operates between Russia and China through Ulaanbaatar, and a railway in the northeast that runs from the Russian border to the center of the Eastern region of Mongolia.  Mongolian Railway is active in both freight and passenger transport, carrying out more than 95 percent of the freight and 55 percent of the passenger traffic of Mongolia.  In total 4.0 million passengers and 11,637 thousand tons of freight were carried by Mongolian Railway in 2002. 
Mongolian Railway has made a valuable contribution to the growth of the Mongolian economy and has played a historical role in the development of national transportation network, connecting new industrial areas, mineral resource deposits and the most populated cities and villages. For Mongolia, which is a landlocked country, Mongolian Railway is critically important, linking the country with Europe and East and South East Asia through China to the south.  However, Mongolian Railways is in desperate need of upgrades in order to continue its service to the Mongolian market.  As such, the DM contractor is going to work closely with the Mongolian Civil Aviation Authority, the Mongolian Railway and the Ministry of Industry and Trade to develop both technical assistance and feasibility study programs that will enable Mongolia to continue to make strides in its economic reforms.

In order to successfully undertake this project, the DM contractor shall organize a meeting with the Mongolian Embassy in Washington, D.C. to obtain contact information of appropriate people to meet while in Mongolia.  Further, the Embassy has agreed to organize assistance while in Mongolia by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.

In addition, the Definitional Mission Contractor shall recommend those projects, if any, identified during the visit that are not stated above with the appropriate supporting documentation that will allow for an informed decision on the part of USTDA on whether to support the project.

The Contractor shall also submit the report to the COTR as an e-mail attachment, and also in Microsoft Word format.

5. 		Project Descriptions and Profile

The Ministry of Commerce has requested USTDA’s assistance with creating a sustainable industrial parks development program in order to foster economic growth, especially among small and medium sized enterprises.  The Technical Assistance (TA) project will also cover the development of two vocational and business management educational programs aimed at training new business managers and entrepreneurs.  While the project is expected to attract many interested U.S. firms, the Ministry of Commerce is relatively inexperienced with administering a competitive selection, and it is necessary to provide technical assistance in undertaking this process.   U.S. firms will submit proposals for the Technical Assistance on Industrial Parks Capacity Building in Afghanistan.  

This RFP concerns assisting the Ministry in choosing a contractor for the Industrial Parks Capacity Building Technical Assistance project.

After two decades of turmoil, Afghanistan’s infrastructure is in a poor state.  The international donor community and the Government of Afghanistan have focused on the development of the business sector, since it is the key to creating jobs and income that are critically needed to foster development and trade.  In 2003, USTDA Director Askey announced an Industrial Capacity and Market Development Initiative for Afghanistan, for the purposes of helping to develop private sector capacity in manufacturing, assembly and services.  The Industrial Parks Capacity Building Technical Assistance is part of that initiative.

As part of its development strategy, the Government of Afghanistan has embarked upon a comprehensive program to develop industrial parks throughout the country.  Industrial parks often provide a range of value-added services, either as part of a lease or on a fee-for-service basis.  These can include: security and access control; labor recruitment; training facilities; specialized industry service centers; logistics facilities; payroll processing; and environmental management.  The development of industrial parks, therefore, can attract and facilitate private investment and employment.  It can also focus development efforts by quickly making new investment locations available.  Despite these efforts, the current industrial property development framework is inadequate, and there is a need for Afghanistan to create a new model.  

In 2003, USTDA supported a Definitional Mission to Afghanistan, which recommended that USTDA fund a TA to address this issue.  The objectives of the technical assistance it proposed are to assist the new Industrial Estates Development Authority (IEDA) to build its capacity in designing and implementing a sustainable industrial parks program.  The capacity building assistance will be provided to Afghan businesses to start or relocate their businesses to the industrial parks.  The TA will also cover the development of two vocational and business management educational programs aimed at training new business managers and entrepreneurs.
