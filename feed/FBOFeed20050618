This conference is to provide contractors a better understanding of the multiple award construction contract, design-build, and best value process.  If you are interested in attending the conference, please submit a “Base Access Request” by 1200 hours on June 23, 2005.  A pre-proposal conference will also be conducted, and will be announced through the E-SOL website identified herein.  This procurement is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition. This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three or more SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) MULTIPLE AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered. AWARD MAY BE MADE TO A FIRM OTHER THAN THAT SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICE. OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED. THEREFORE OFFERORS INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERMS. This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation will be based on issuance of individual task orders with specific scope of work valued from 200,000 yen to 30,000,000 yen. Task Orders will be issued as either 100% Plans and Specifications or Design-Build. 100% Plans and Specifications means the design has been completed by the Government and the contractor is to perform the construction only.  Design-build means the contractor performs both the design and construction.  The work to be performed under this contract will be performed primarily in Sasebo, Japan; however, the Government reserves the right to issue work within The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Area of Responsibility.  In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (Architect-Engineer) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract. In an effort to avoid a potential conflict of interest, Offerors are encouraged to offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s). The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team. Lead Design Firm(s), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project. All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline in Japan.  After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract. Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains two (2) 12-month options with two one-year award term incentives. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of 1,000,000 yen is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST THREE CONTRACTS. THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE PROPOSALS WILL BE AWARDED A CONTRACT WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE.  The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil on or about July 1, 2005. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AND ALL AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION. Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the Internet website address listed above.

<CONTACT>Kathy Giordano Contracting Specialist 7037871024     kathy.giordano@mms.gov;
<DESC>SOLICITATION NOTICE GovWorks is issuing Request for Proposal No. 14350405RP43057 on behalf of the US Army, Product Manager (PM) for Airborne Reconnaissance Low Program (ARL), who has a requirement to obtain required technical assistance related to airborne sensors so that validated requirements can be met for the Warfighter using the airborne platforms and sensors effectively.  The scope of this work entails locating, analyzing, evaluating and fielding sensor systems that are integrated to airborne platforms. These sensors range in capability from simple cameras to complex radar and signals acquisition and direction finding equipment. Communications and data links from the platform to the ground station is a vital part of the asset as is the dissemination of the Intelligence products to the various enclaves. The support effort produces a viable approach to accommodate the demands of the community for Intelligence that is actionable and relevant. The scope of work behind the effort includes managing the vendor's claims against the physical practicalities by analysis and investigation. Often, there are alternate methods of obtaining a satisfactory sensor performance by including other functional modules that complement the basic function. For example, radar could be used to cue a camera to prosecute a target to the fullest extent of identification. The period of performance will be one base year from date of award and four (4) one year options.  This requirement is being procured as a Small Business Set Aside.  The resultant award is expected to be a Single Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Time and Materials contract.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541330 with a small business size standard of $23M.  The primary work will be performed at a Government facility located west of the Washington D. C. Metropolitan area with work also in OCONUS areas, currently operating in Republic of Korea.  The competitive RFP will be available via the Internet at http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp under RFP14350405RP43057 on or before June 21, 2005.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the website for all information related to this procurement.  Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Kathy.Giordano@mms.gov AND Melissa.Onyszko@mms.gov.  Ensure the RFP number is referenced on all correspondence.  Proposals are due before 4:00 EST, Thursday July 21, 2005 at the address listed in Block 8 of SF 33.
