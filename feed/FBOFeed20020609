The work involved includes, but is not limited to: install new water mains, new water valves, new tees, new tapping sleeves, new fire hydrants, clean and disinfect the interior of a 500,000 gallon water tank and remove and replace trees and shrubs.  A firm fixed price contract award is contemplated.
This action is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns.  Interested HUBZone small business concerns should indicate interest to the Contracting Officer, in writing, as early as possible but not later than 5 calendar days of this notice.  As a minimum the following information is required:  (a) a copy of the certificate issued by SBA of your qualifications as a HUBZone concern; (b) a positive statement of your intention to bid on this contract as a prime contractor; (c) evidence of the recency and experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contacts and telephone numbers; (d) evidence of bonding capability to the maximum magnitude of the project to include both single and aggregate totals.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on availability of interested HUBZone concerns.  Failure to submit all information requested will result in a contractor not being considered as an interested HUBZone concern.  A decision on whether this requirement will be pursued as a HUBZone small business set-aside or on an unrestricted basis will be posted on EPS within 2 calendar days after the 5 calendar days have expired.
The project magnitude is estimated between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 23491 with a small business size standard of $28,500,000.00.   
The successful contractor will be selected using Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures, resulting in the Best Value to the Government. Past performance is significantly more important than price.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 8 Jul 02 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.eps.gov.  Paper copies will not be available. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. It is anticipated that the following viewers will be needed to view the solicitation:  Microsoft Word (.doc), Adobe Acrobat Reader (.pdf), WinZip (.zip or .exe.), MaxView/SourceView.exe, Autocad.
