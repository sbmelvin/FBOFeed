Grants are awarded for a one, two, or three-year period and include the following mandatory visits: a Data Verifier orientation visit, a verification visit every six months, and a final visit after the project has closed. Most grants are for a three-year period; therefore, over the life of a three-year grant the Contractor shall visit the grantee approximately six times. It is estimated that each visit to a grantee takes approximately 5 days, including preparing for the visit (contacting grantee, reading grant documentation, copying reports), travel time, interviews with the grantee and its beneficiaries, and drafting visit reports. This requirement includes the following tasks: contractor shall train grantees in the use of the IAF data collection instrument; train grantees on data collection strategies; assist grantees in the selection of indicators that present problems in collecting the required data; document and verify grant results with grantees, beneficiaries, and grantees' partners; draft reports documenting data verification visit findings; and write project history reports for terminating grants. In addition, when requested by the IAF, contractor shall accompany the IAF staff and Contractors on field trips; provide grant results verification services in other countries; and participate in training and/or conferences. The Contractor shall have fluency in Spanish and possess a working knowledge of Spanish (speaking and writing skills). The Contractor shall have a physical presence in the Dominican Republic and be willing to travel to remote areas of the country and Caribbean area to conduct fieldwork at the grantees' physical location or where grant activities are taking place.
<p>This indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract will be for a one-year period with four option periods. The Government will consider proposals from all responsible sources. Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading.

<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB), Behavioral Research Program (BRP), plans to procure on a sole source basis from Oxford University Press, Inc., Great Clarendon Street, Oxford, OX2 6DP, England, a supplement entitled "Cancer Prevention and Control in the Changing Communication Landscape" in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. <br /><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract. <br /><br />The Behavioral Research Program (BRP) within the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences initiates, supports, and evaluates a comprehensive program of research ranging from basic behavioral research to the development, testing, and dissemination of interventions in areas such as tobacco use, screening, dietary behavior, and sun protection. Its goal is to increase the breadth, depth, and quality of behavioral research in cancer prevention and control.</p>
<p>The changing media landscape, represented by an information ecology including Web 2.0, social media, wikis, and other multidirectional communication channels, has dramatically altered the way the BRP conceptualizes and communicates efforts related to cancer prevention and control. In response to this evolving communication landscape, cancer care providers, systems, and communication practitioners have begun to examine the impact of the changing media landscape on cancer-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior across the cancer care continuum. A supplement to the Journal of the National Cancer Institute will be published containing empirical papers/original research, guest commentaries, meta-analyses, and review papers that address how the changing media landscape is influencing communication about cancer in three distinct areas: 1) health journalism and mass media, 2) clinical care and patient support, and 3) cancer prevention and control interventions.</p>
<p>The contractor shall produce a journal supplement entitled "Cancer Prevention and Control in the Changing Communication Landscape" in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI). The contractor shall manage the peer review process of manuscripts and produce and publish the supplement. Once published, the Contractor shall distribute the monograph to institutional and individual print subscribers of the journal. An additional 350 copies will be shipped to the NCI Project Officer. The Contractor shall also produce an online version of the monograph, which will be accessible by institutions and individuals with active online subscriptions to the journal.</p>
<p>Oxford University Press is the only known source available to publish supplements to the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. In order to reach researchers, cancer care practitioners, policy makers, and health communication practitioners, this supplement needs to be published in a journal with a wide audience of various disciplines, and an audience primarily concerned with cancer control. Given the broad distribution and variety of subscribers of JNCI and the quality of this journal it was determined that Oxford University Press is uniquely qualified to publish this supplement. The JNCI is not affiliated with the National Cancer Institute. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisition on or before 11:00 AM EST on April 16, 2012. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax) an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisition to the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Laura Glockner, Contract Specialist at laura.glockner@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-120050-LG on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to DiscoveRx Corporation, 42501 Albrae Street, Freemont CA 94538 for the purchase of Eighteen (18), PathHunter&reg; Cell Plating Reagent (500mL) and two (2) PathHunter&reg; Detector Kits (2400mL).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The mission of the NCATS is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. NCATS will optimize biochemical, cellular and model organism-based assays submitted by the biomedical research community; perform automated high-throughput screening (HTS); and perform chemistry optimization on confirmed hits to produce chemical probes for dissemination to the research community. <br /><br />PRODUCT DESCRIPTION<br />1. Quanity: Eighteen (18), PathHunter&reg; Cell Plating Reagent ,500mL<br />2 .Quantity: Two (2), PathHunter&reg; Detector Kits , 2400mL</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION</p>
<p>The Principal Investigator and NCATS tested different assay formats to measure selective signaling of the D2 dopamine receptor through &beta;-arrestin. The only assay format that met the standard assay robustness criteria for HTS was the DiscoveRx assay. The DiscoveRx D2 dopamine assay for &beta;-arrestin signal uses the DiscoveRx PathHunter&reg; technology. In this assay system, &beta;-Arrestin is fused to an N-terminal deletion mutant of &beta;-gal (termed the enzyme acceptor of EA) the GPCR of interest is fused to a smaller (42 amino acids); weakly complementing fragment termed ProLink<sup>TM</sup>. In cells that stably express these fusion proteins, ligand stimulation results in the interaction of &beta;-Arrestin and the ProLink-tagged GPCR, forcing the complementation of the two &beta;-gal fragments and resulting in the formation of a functional enzyme that converts substrate to detectable signal. NCATS has done extensive work to miniaturize the assay to 1536-well format and demonstrated that it produces robust data using the HTS capabilities at NCATS by doing pilot screens with small compound collections. The current D2 DiscoveRx assay is ready for HTS at NCATS. At this moment, there is no alternative assay available to measure D2 dopamine &beta;-arrestin signaling that would allow NCATS to screen of a large collection of compounds (&gt;350,000).</p>
<p><br />The D2 dopamine receptor &beta;-arrestin assay from DiscoveRx consists of a proprietary engineered cell line (PathHunter&reg; D2 CHO K-1) and companion proprietary assay detection kit (PathHunter&reg; Detection Kit). PathHunter<sup>TM</sup> &szlig;-arrestin GPCR assays detect primary rather than secondary activation events, offering less opportunity for off-target effects. The assays typically also provide larger assay windows than calcium or cAMP and can be run in the same well as the latter.<br />DiscoveRx's Flash Detection Kits provide a simple, homogeneous gain-of-signal assay for measurement of enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) activity in live cells. PathHunter Detection Reagents provided by DiscoveRx are designed for use with their PathHunter Cell Lines expressing both the complementing fragments of &beta;-galactosidase (&beta;-gal).</p>
<p>Additional attributes of the DiscoveRx items are that the PathHunter Detection Kit was designed to measure intracellular EFC activity within 2 hours after addition of detection reagents. This kit is ideal for use with any standard benchtop luminometer. The PathHunter Flash Detection Kit was designed to measure interacellular EFC activity in less than one minute after addition of detection reagents. As a result, receptor activation can be detected very rapidly with minimal disruption of cell biology. This kit is ideal for instruments with onboard fluid handling and rapid chemiluminescent data acquisition, such as Hamamatsu FDSS6000 that is currently in use by our labs.</p>
<p>These cell lines are engineered to express the complementing fragments &beta;-gal in different cellular compartments.</p>
<p>PathHunter&reg; &beta;-Arrestin assays detect GPCR activation by measuring the interaction of &beta;-Arrestin with activated GPCRs. A small, 42 amino acid enzyme fragment, called ProLink was appended to the C-terminus of the GPCR. Arrestin was fused to the larger enzyme fragment, termed EA (Enzyme Acceptor). Activation of the GPCR stimulates binding of arrestin and forces the complementation of the two enzyme fragments, resulting in formation of a functional &beta;-gal enzyme capable of hydrolyzing substrate and generating a chemiluminescent signal.</p>
<p>In the PathHunter Nuclear Translocation Assays, EA is localized in the cell nucleus and the small complementing PK fragment is expressed as a fusion protein to a target of interest in the cytoplasm. When a signaling pathway is activated a cascade of events ensues, resulting in the translocation of the target protein to the nucleus and forced complementation of the two &beta;-gal fragments and formation of a functional enzyme that hydrolyzes substrate and generation of a chemiluminescent signal.</p>
<p>The PathHunter&reg; Cell-Based Kinase Assays monitor the interaction of wild type, full length receptor tyrosine kinase proteins with SH2 phosphotyrosine binding domains using EFC. This assay does not require antibodies or washes and can be easily adapted to a one-step HTS-friendly assay.</p>
<p>These PathHunter&reg; Mitotic Index Assays monitor mitotic activity in live cells by measuring the complementation of nuclear and cytoplasmically localized &beta;-gal fragments. During mitosis, the nuclear envelope degrades and allows the two &beta;-gal fragments to complement in the cytoplasm, forming active enzyme and generation of chemiluminescent signal.</p>
<p>Any changes toNCATS' original protocol will cause costly delays time and effort. This project was started using these products from DiscoveRx Corp and these requested reagents are needed in order to finish this project. NCATS cannot afford to spend any time looking for potential alternative suppliers as this will be too expensive to the government and would be detrimental to the data already created under these requested variables. These are trademarked items and not available from any other sources.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541712, with business size standard of 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-54 (November 2, 2011). This acquisition is set-aside for small business.<br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by April 12, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.<br />Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number, NHLBI-CSB-(TR)-2012-107-RSF may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6145, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Rashida Ferebee.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS WILL BE ISSUED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON OR ABOUT April 17, 2012
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to issue an RFP for an Indefinite/Delivery, Indefinite/Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contract for the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center (SCCC). This will be a 100% small business set-aside IDIQ Task Order contract.</p>
<p>The NIH, NICHD is the lead Federal agency for the conduct of basic, clinical and epidemiological research to develop new contraceptives and to evaluate existing methods of contraception and reproductive health. The Center for Population Research (CPR), within NICHD, was established in 1968 by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, with the important goal of developing new contraceptives through the use of contracts and grants. Within CPR, the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has long supported several preclinical contraceptive testing facilities, as well as facilities for chemical and peptide synthesis. To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996 CRHB established the initial NICHD CCTN in order to conduct Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new contraceptive methods.</p>
<p>The NICHD CCTN is an important component of the CRHB contraceptive development capability. Products that have undergone formulation and successful pre-clinical testing, either through the CRHB formulation and testing facilities or through outside sources, are candidates for clinical testing in the CCTN. The CCTN is particularly valuable for providing a venue for testing new contraceptive drugs and devices that have been developed by small companies that lack the resources to support large-scale clinical trials.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a re-competition of the SCCC that will operate under an Indefinite/Delivery, Indefinite/Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contract. The SCCC will be assisting with protocol development, preparation of study materials, regulatory document coordination, clinical monitoring, coordination of laboratory services, data collection and data analysis for the Female and Male sites. The resultant IDIQ contract will be for a seven (7) year period of performance. The results of these clinical trials would be the basis for advancing candidate drugs and devices through development with the ultimate goal of submission to the FDA in support of a New Drug Application (NDA), Premarket notification 510k, Premarket Approval (PMA) or Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE).</p>
<p>It is estimated that the new NICHD CCTN will consist of up to 16 sites capable of performing female contraceptive clinical trials and approximately 4 sites capable of performing male contraceptive clinical trials. Please be advised that the NICHD is issuing separate RFPs for each CCTN Topic Area (Female Contraceptive Clinical Trials &amp; Male Contraceptive Clinical Trials) and the SCCC for the CCTN. This Pre-Solicitation announcement is for the RFP for the Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center only.</p>
<p>The RFP will be made available electronically only via the FedBizOpps website (http://www.fbo.gov). Offerors are responsible for routinely checking the FedBizOpps website for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued.</p>

While production incorporation and retrofit are pending on this ECP, the fleet requires&nbsp;an interim cover to support deployments. This requirement is to manufacture fifty (50) ship sets of thses Interim Swashplate Environmental Covers. <br />This requirment is sole sourced to Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.

Redna Fork, redna.fork@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is extending the current Southern California and Arizona 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).  NAVFAC SW is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) Developmental Stage (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, CA; and Phoenix, AZ) to participate in this BOA program.  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to two additional years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).
  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts. The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.
 Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government, upon SBA concurrence, reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts. The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).
 Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,500,000 per firm, per year. Any unused capacity in one year will not be carried over to the subsequent years. Individual task orders will range between $2,001 and $1,000,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $30,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.
 The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) for new entrants once a year for each region.

<DESC>US Government Seeks Expression of Interest in Salinas, California 0CA2795

Requirement:
The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Salinas, California.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 2,785 rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2,422 ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (ABOA). The lease term requirement is for three (3) years, two (2) years firm. The space must be available for occupancy by January 1, 2013.
The Government will require two (2) reserved, parking spaces.
The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to Base Notice: to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Division Middle East District (TAM) intends to award in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act, as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6, up to six (6), but no less than two (2), A-E Design Services SATOCs, with an estimated overall capacity of $240 million. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  Up to six awards may be issued up to one year from the date of the release of this FBO announcement.  The period of performance for each SATOC shall include one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods, for an overall performance period of five years.  The total capacity may be used at any time throughout the life of the contract and the Government reserves the right to move the capacity forward as necessary to meet operational needs.  Options will be exercised in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract."  Only firms who are committed to working on-site and in-country, either as the prime firm or with subcontractors, in all regions and areas within TAM's AOR, including Iraq and Afghanistan, will be considered for this solicitation. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330. Projected contract award date is August/September 2012 for the initial one-year period. It is the Government's intent to make multiple contract awards under a single solicitation. Each contract will have a guaranteed minimum amount of $5,000.00 for each of the awarded SATOCs. All large business firms, selected for this contract, must comply with FAR 52.219-9, "Small Business Subcontracting Plan," regarding the requirement for an acceptable subcontracting plan. The plan is not required to be included in the information submitted in response to this announcement. Work will be issued by task order, either cost-reimbursable, firm fixed-pr ice or labor-hour.  It is TAM's intent to issue most task orders as firm fixed-price actions. The task orders are anticipated to be equally distributed among the design firms; however, this distribution may change depending upon the changing needs and contingency environment of TAM's AOR. TAM's AOR has traditionally paralleled the CENTCOM AOR, which includes the Middle East, the Arabian Gulf states, portions of Southwest and Central Asia, and portions of Africa. TAM's mission has further expanded to include several new worldwide programs, including the Center of Standardization for Contingency Standard Designs, the Technical Center of Expertise for Aircraft Hangar Fire Protection, and Satellite Communications.  Based on TAM's newly acquired missions, it is projected that the Design Services Architect-Engineer Contracts will include all locations where TAM has been designated program manager.  While the primary focus of this contract will be on work within the CENTCOM region, the A-E firm must be able to perform work throughout TAM's AOR, including the locations for TAM's newly acquired worldwide missions.  The A-E firm must be willing to service locations worldwide including performing site visits.  TAM subcontracting goals are as follows: (a) 7% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with small business concerns; (b) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by HUBZones; (c) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by Service-Disabled Veterans; (d) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantage individuals; (e) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by women.  Contractor compliance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be monitored through regular submission of reports into the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).  This plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.  NOTE: All firms should be aware of the limitations of DFARS 236.602-70. This clause requires that A-E contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are estimated to exceed $500,000, and are to be performed in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, can only be awarded to United States firms or to joint ventures of United States and host nation firms. TAM's AOR contains many countries that border on the Arabian Gulf such as Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Saudi Arabia. In fact, the majority of the countries where TAM has a current presence and construction work border the Arabian Gulf. Consequently, while this acquisition is to be issued as full and open to allow for the greatest amount of competition among qualified A-E firms, it is noted that at least 50%, if not more, of the task orders to be awarded (and, consequently, a majority of the total dollar value of task order awards) under the new A-E IDCs will be limited to U.S firms or joint ventures involving U.S. firms.  2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Primary facility designs may include, but are not be limited to, the following: A05 and A06 Airports including airport lighting and terminals and hangers; A09 Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection; B01 Barracks, Dormitories; D04 Design-Build-preparation of Requests for Proposals; D07 Dining Halls, Clubs, Restaurants; D08 Dredging Studies and Design; F01 Blast-Resistant Design; F03 Fire Protection; G01 Garages, Vehicle Maintenance Facilities; H01 Harbors, Jetties, Ship Terminal Facilities; H07 Highways, Streets, Airfield Paving, Parking Lots; H09 Hospital and Medical Facilities; I01 Industrial Buildings, Manufacturing Plants; I06 Irrigation, Drainage; M08 Modular Systems Design, Pre-fabricated Structures or Components; O01 Office Buildings; P12 Power Generation, Transmission Distribution; R05 Refrigeration Plants/Systems; R06 Rehabilitation (buildings, structures, facilities); S03 Seismic Design and Studies; S04 Sewage Collection, Treatment and Disposal; S05 Soils and Geologic Studies-Foundations; S07 Solid Wastes, Incineration, Landfill; S09 Structural Design; S11 Sustainable Design; S13 Storm Water Handling and Facilities; U03 Utilities; W01 Warehouses and Depots; and W03 Water Supply, Treatment, and Distribution.

MED expects to solicit a wide range of employment specialties to meet its needs, as well as to respond to changing mission requirements.  Preparation of 1391 documents may also be required. The firm may be used to provide engineering experts and consultants. It is anticipated that construction projects being supported by these services will include major military construction, as well as infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction and environmental design actions. The firms must show experience with and may be required to design using MicroStation V8i, Bentley Architecture, Autodesk Revit 2011 or higher; AutoCAD (CAD output may be requested in dwg or dgn format); use Bentley's ProjectWise file management software; and prepare construction cost estimates by computer utilizing Corps of Engineers, TRACES, Microcomputer Aided Cost Estimating Systems/ MII, PACES, PC COST and other related systems.  3. SELECTION CRITERIA: This acquisition is for architect-engineer (A-E) services, and is procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in Subpart 36.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit: (1) a Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, Parts I and II, and (2) any requested supplemental data to the procurement office shown. Following an evaluation of the qualifications and performance data submitted, three or more firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required will be chosen for negotiation. Selection of firms for negotiation shall be made in order of preference based on the demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance in accordance with the specific selection criteria listed in the announcement.   Firms that show recent, relevant MED design experience (within 5 years from this date), shall be given more consideration in the selection process.  The selection criteria for this solicitation are listed below, in descending order of importance. Criteria a through h are primary. Criteria i is secondary and will only be used as a 'tie-breaker' among firms that are essentially technically equal. (a) The firm's current specialized experience and technical competence relative to the design services required under this announcement, i.e., knowledge of design of building envelopes, systems or facilities similar to those listed in Paragraph 2 (Project Information), above. Please note that firms must possess current experience and technical competence in the Experience Categories as listed in Paragraph 2 to be considered for selection.  In addition, more emphasis shall be placed on a firm's specialized experience and technical competence that relates to the primary facility designs as follows:   A05, A06, B01, H01, H07, and S05.  (b) The evaluation will consider the qualifications, availability and length of services of the firm's key U.S. Licensed or Registered Professional personnel in the following disciplines: project management (Function Code 48), architecture (06), civil engineering (12), cost engineering (18), electrical engineering (21), environmental engineering (23), fire protection engineer (25), foundation/geotechnical engineer (27), mechanical engineering (42), Planner (47), and structural engineering (57) in the design of facilities or systems similar to those listed in paragraph 2 (Project Information), above. Again, more emphasis shall be placed on personnel who have qualifications that support design actions for the primary facility designs noted. In addition, firms with greater numbers of employees within the Function Codes listed above shall also be rated higher in the selection process. Firms who possess employees in the majority or all of the codes listed will also be rated higher.  (c) Firms should demonstrate that they have the ability to successfully perform $20 million dollars of design services per year for a five year period through self-performance, via a joint venture or partnership relationship, or with the assistance of subcontractors. Firms with greater capacity shall be given more consideration in the selection process.  (d) Experience in MED's primary AOR (basically CENTCOM's) (within 5 years from the announcement date) with emphasis on the Middle East and the Arabian Gulf States, will be rated higher than firms with experience only in the United States or other areas of the world.  (e) The firm's Design Quality Management Plan (DQMP) for this solicitation (not longer than five pages) will be evaluated along with the clarity and conciseness of the material presented in response to this solicitation.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought synopsis announcement. This market survey is for information only to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this synopsis.<br />The purpose of this anticipated contract is to procure repairs to Paveway III Laser-Guided Bombs. The item anticipated to be repaired is:<br />NSN: 1325-01-356-1432<br />Noun: WGU-39/B
<p>Estimated Repair Quantity: 400ea</p>
<p><br />The anticipated contract will be a firm-fixed price and will support the United States Air Force. Total contract value is anticipated to be approximately $1,500,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paveway Laser Guided Bombs are purchased to a Performance Specification and as a result, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) owns the drawing/technical data package. The Government cannot provide access to product drawing because of the Government's lack of data rights in the data. The item being considered for repair is very technical by nature, as it is provides guidance for a specific munitions item. The WGU-39/B determines the appropriate method to guide the munitions item from point of release to a laser-illuminated target. It is extremely complex, and the Government knows of no entity other than the OEM with sufficient technical data rights to the WGU-39/B to provide this requirement. The Government can provide no reverse engineering funds at this time in order to develop technical data required to fill this requirement.</p>
<p>Offeror's response to this Synopsis shall be limited to five pages and shall include the following information:<br />Offeror's name, address, point of contact, phone number, e-mail address, and CAGE code if applicable.<br />Offeror's interest in bidding on the solicitation when it is issued.<br />Small Business Size and status if applicable.<br />A capability statement that pertains to the anticipated contract. Capability statement shall include a statement of the offeror's plan to obtain requisite technical data rights for this requirement, or evidence of the offeror's possession of sufficient data rights.<br />Any other information that the Offeror feels is pertinent to the anticipated contract.</p>
<p><br />Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than 4:00 PM (MTN) 13 April 2012. All interested contractors must be registered in CCR to be eligible for award of Government contracts. Email your response to Mrs. Carmen North, Contract Negotiator email carmen.north@hill.af.mil or Mr. Nathan Lee, Contracting Officer email address: nathan.lee@hill.af.mil</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only, it shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information to serve as a market survey to assist in the development of a procurement strategy.  The Government seeks potential sources having the full capability to perform full-rate production of tactical missile propulsion systems and information on the potential source's knowledge, skill and experiences in research, development, and testing of solid, gel and hybrid rocket propulsion technology for application in U.S. Army missile systems.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Redstone Arsenal, AL, on behalf of the U.S. Army, desires to obtain information to serve as a market survey to aid in development of procurement strategy for research, development, and testing of propulsion technology for application in U.S. Army missile systems.  As a result of issuing this RFI, the Government expects to receive information from potential offerors to assist in determination of the ability of potential offerors to develop and transition propulsion technology into tactical propulsion systems production operations.  The AMRDEC has requirements for research, development, and testing of solid, gel and hybrid rocket propulsion technology for application in U.S. Army missile systems.  Central to these requirements is a focus on controllable thrust, enhanced performance, reduced sensitivity, and environmental compliance.  Therefore, as part of these efforts, all technology development should address the specific issues of the goal at hand, whether that goal is controllable thrust, performance, reduced sensitivity, or environmental compliance without neglecting any of the other goals central to this requirement.  Due to technology transition objectives, the Government seeks to identify companies that have capabilities in research, development, and testing of solid, gel and hybrid rocket propulsion technology and the full capability to perform full rate production of tactical missile propulsion systems.  Technology Areas: (1) New Ingredients and Materials:  Propellant ingredients that are stable, compatible, processable, and cost effective for Army missile propulsion are among the ingredients to be developed, synthesized, and evaluated. These include high energy-density oxidizers, fuels, polymers, ballistic modifiers, processing additives, bonding agents, plasticizers and gelling agents.  In addition, new materials for composite cases, to include fibers, resins, insulators, and nozzle components that can enhance motor performance shall be evaluated. Novel and/or improved processing techniques for propulsion system structural components shall be employed to enhance performance, integration, and cost effectiveness.   New ingredients must be characterized for heat of formation, density, purity, elemental analysis, stability, hazards properties, and if pertinent, crystal structure, molecular weight, equivalent weight, functionality, viscosity, and reactivity.  Hazards associated with the preparation, analysis, and use of solid or gel propellant ingredients and of those materials employed in the manufacture of rocket motor components or propellant are to be identified.  Samples of promising new materials shall be obtained or prepared and analyzed to deliver to the AMRDEC for verification.  (2) Rocket Propulsion Technology: (a) Minimum Signature Propellants:  Less sensitive high performance minimum signature propellants with an objective theoretical impulse density greater than 14.0 lb-sec/in3 that maximize producibility and minimize cost.  (b) Reduced Smoke Propellant:  High performance, reduced smoke composite propellants with an objective theoretical impulse density greater than 16.0 lb-sec/in3 that maximize producibility and minimize cost.  (c) Composite (Smoky) Propellant:  High performance composite propellants with an objective theoretical impulse density greater than 17.5 lb-sec/in3 that maximize producibility and minimize cost.  (d) Rocket Propulsion Inert Components:  Design, development, analysis and test of rocket cases, nozzles, insulators, combustion chambers and/or tankages for solid or gel propulsion systems, to include controllable thrust devices/components shall be conducted.  Integration methods and processing techniques that enhance propulsion system performance, survivability and Insensitive Munitions characteristics shall be designed, developed and evaluated.  (3) Controllable Thrust Propulsion (CTP):  Experimental and analytical investigations of approaches to provide a variety of thrust time profiles from a single motor design shall be conducted.  Approaches to be examined include barrier type pulse motors, bulkhead type pulse motors, variable area nozzles, gels and hybrids.  The majority of the applications for this technology also require minimum signature, and therefore concept implementation must not preclude meeting this requirement or the requirement for Insensitive Munitions.  Development and testing of structural and control components, propellants, or materials for CTP to validate the component performance and assumptions and to address the critical design issues shall be performed. Specialized propulsion system testing shall be conducted to verify the predicted effects of each developed component on the system performance described in this effort. The contractor shall demonstrate an integrated flight type CTP prototype unit. This shall encompass the system engineering and design engineering activities associated with producing a detailed design of flight type system test hardware. Motor stability, ballistics, and signature should be demonstrated over an operational temperature ranges.  Fabrication and integration of all the hardware required to support the flight type system testing to include control hardware, any specialized instrumentation and test/missile interfaces shall be performed.  Design and performance models based on the outcome of the flight type hardware validation shall be updated.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about the research, development, and production capabilities of potential offerors in the Technology Areas identified.  Responses: To assist in market research associated with the research, development, and testing of propulsion technology, the government is requesting information from industry.  Interested parties should submit white papers not to exceed 15 pages and no smaller than 12pt Times New Roman font.  The white paper should include the following:  (1) A brief description of any projects that the respondent's company is or has been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI.  This should include any relevant lessons learned, (2) Any additional materials that are deemed appropriate by the respondent.   The objective of this process is to assess potential offerors capable of achieving the stated objectives.  After RFI release, there will be a period of for question submittal.  All questions must be submitted in writing and reference the RFI number no later than 3:00 CST on 13 April 2012 to the contractual point of contact Chris Sykes at christopher.c.sykes@us.army.mil; telephone requests for addition information will not be honored.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) Super Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) will be the contracting vehicle used to implement building efficiency projects at Army Reserve facilities in the Northeast region (99th RSC). These facilities are located in 173 towns and cities across 13 states of the northeast region of the United States with a total square footage of 6.5M. The typical configuration at each of these installations is an administrative or office type facility and a vehicle maintenance facility. The customer would like to attain maximum facility energy savings - within the ESPC framework - through a comprehensive, holistic analysis of building efficiency measures. The intent is to optimize the combination of conservation measures (with various levels of cost and savings) to achieve more substantial energy savings within a given facility. In achieving their energy goals, the 99th RCS is interested in any of the energy conservation measures (ECM) defined in Attachment J-3 of the basic DOE IDIQ ESPC contract along with any operational improvements to meet their energy goals. The two main considerations of this ESPC will be to: (1) execute the project at a large number of locations that are geographically separated, (2) achieve a holistic, comprehensive analysis that produces the maximum energy savings per square foot of the modified facility.

<p>The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan, as well as provides full range of programmatic and administrative management support for USAID Representative Office in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan. Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.</p>
<p>The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian Republics. The U.S. Government's program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare. It ranks as one of the Agency's largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $115 million annually. The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 implementing organizations funded via acquisition and/or assistance mechanisms.

 The Boston Healthcare System VA Medical Center is seeking qualified vendors to provide supplies listed in chart below.  The following information is provided to assist the Department of Veterans Affairs in conducting market research of industry to identify potential contractors to provide the items identified below:

Function to perform:

A device to cross totally occluded arteries (TOA).  The mainstay of crossing a TOA is utilizing the subintimal plane and then blindly reentering the true lumen of the artery distal or proximal to the occlusion.  The catheter bores a lumen in the plaque, and regains intra-luminal access, which can then be followed with angioplasty and stent.

Crosser catheter:

Catheter with core wire

Transmits mechanical vibration to the tip of the catheter at 20,000 cycles/second

Catheter system is indicated to facilitate the intra-luminal placement of conventional guide wires beyond peripheral artery chronic total occlusions via atherectomy.

Microsheath:
Used with crosser catheter
Used to help navigate and focus the energy of the crosser at the tip of the catheter



STK#         	DESCRIPTION / SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS
CRUS6A	 	Crosser catheter, s6
CRUO14SA	 	Crosser catheter, 14s
CRUO14PA	 	Crosser catheter, 14p

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) SYNOPSIS.


This is a sources sought request for information (RFI) announcement to seek potential Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB'S) or other Small Business (SB) vendors that could fulfill the below requirement. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The applicable NAICS code is 812930 and the Size Standard is $6,500,000. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of market research being conducted by the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) to identify capable potential small business sources for parking and shuttle design services for The Martinsburg, West Virginia Veterans Administration Medical Health Care Facility (VAMHC). Based on responses to this sources sought, the DVA will determine how the solicitation for this requirement will be posted and competed.

2.  Scope of Work:  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in this statement of work (SOW), except as may otherwise be specified.

	3.  Background:  The Martinsburg VA Medical Center occupies 178 acres of land (see attached campus map) in Berkeley County, West Virginia.  The Medical Center provides a full range of inpatient and outpatient medical services to some 25,000 enrolled Veterans.  The Medical Center experiences a high-volume of vehicular traffic Monday through Friday during the hours 7:30am-5:00pm.  Parking for Veterans may be difficult during these peak hours.  Various parking lots are utilized, and the distance from a parking spot to a building entrance can exceed 100 yards.  The Medical Center is exploring the feasibility of providing Valet parking services, as well as Shuttle Bus Services.  These services would aid Veterans with limited mobility.  It would also enhance overall safety, convenience and customer service for the facility.  As a first-step in the feasibility process, the Medical Center would like a customized, detailed and comprehensive plan to be designed by a firm with extensive and expert experience in the field.  The finished plan would include all of the details on staffing, arrangements, flow patterns, required equipment, preferred practices and other such considerations necessary for providing a smooth, efficient, and experience-enhancing service for Veterans at the Medical Center.

<DESC>I.	Introduction
<p>This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of Washington Headquarters Services (WHS).  In order to proactively plan for future requirements, WHS is conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced and interested large and small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) to provide administrative management and general management consulting.  Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be incurred by interested parties in responding to this sources sought announcement.</p>
<p>II.	Background</p>
<p>Based on past requirements, the Washington Headquarters Services Acquisition Directorate expects to receive planned and urgent requests for management and consulting studies from OSD, WHS, PFPA and other DoD organizations.  The tempo and scale of prior requests have ranged from well-focused, small-scale studies of efficiency in intimate work groups to rapid, widely-scoped studies with the potential for significant departmental impact and attendant high-level management attention.  Future requests may require literature searches, personal interviews, data collection, travel, briefings, oral presentations and written reports on a full range of management and organizational topics.  In the past these topics have covered business process optimization, human capital management, organization capability enhancement, assessment of organizational effectiveness and the development of business metrics.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The 377th Civil Engineer Group, Kirtland Air Force Base (Albuquerque) NM 87117 requires a bridge contract to succeed contract FA9401-11-C-0010 which expires on 31 March 2012. The bridge contract will consist of a Nine (9) month basic period of performance with nine 1-month options. The AFNWC/PKOC intends to make an award to Chugach Management Services, Joint Venture (CMSJV), 3800 Centerpoint Drive, Ste 601, Anchorage, AK 99503. Interested parties may e-mail susan.mcdaniel@kirtland.af.mil or fax 505-853-1540, Attn: Susan McDaniel, not later than 15 March 2012, 12:00 p.m. (Noon) MST.
<p>IAW FAR Part 5.207(c)(15), the proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR 6.302. <br /><br />The Contractor shall provide all management personnel and services necessary to operate the facilities. The 337th Civil Engineer Division services include: Administration Management &amp; Customer Support; Facility &amp; Infrastructure Maintenance &amp; Support; Operations (Physical Plant Operations); Grounds Maintenance, Refuse Collection &amp; Disposal; Architect/Engineer Services (Planning, Programming, Design &amp; Construction Management); Real Property Management; Logistics Support (Material Control) and Civil Engineer Computer Systems Management.<br /><br />Kirtland AFB consists of over 3,100 facilities over 51,500 acres, and supports over 160 mission partner agencies. Kirtland facilities include: 1,780 facilities with 7,437,024 square feet of floor space; 223 miles of water pipe lines; 139 miles of fences; 97 miles of sanitary sewer lines; 87 miles of natural gas lines; 41 miles of communication ducts; 750 miles of roads; 731 miles of electrical transmission and distribution lines; 20 Electrical substations; over 1.38M square yards of Airfield pavement; over 161 BBL of Petroleum Storage; and a Land Fill operation. Geographically separate site locations supported include Maui, HI; Socorro, NM; Truth or Consequences, NM; Pecos, NM; and Albuquerque, NM. The highest level of security clearance required for this contract is TOP SECRET. Twenty-four hour customer service call, emergency response and plant operations are required. Personnel filling selected responsible positions shall possess appropriate licensing and certifications.</p>
<p><strong>This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. <br /><br /></strong>DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) <br /><br />CMSJV is the only company with the personnel, tools, equipment, vehicles, and materiel mobilized to perform these services which are essential and mission critical to Kirtland AFB, its nuclear surety mission, mission partners and the base population without a lapse in service or a duplication of significant capital investment and start-up costs. Any contractor except CMSJV would, of necessity, experience investment or start-up costs for this large operation, and the government would not recover such costs through competition of the bridge contract simply because of the extremely short contract term.<br />As the incumbent for the past eleven (11) years, CMSJV appears to be the only contractor who is fully knowledgeable of the requirements and level of effort required to meet the needs of the base population to sustain the level of service required and ensure no Notices of Violation are received for failure to meet all federal and state regulations and requirements. This is important because Kirtland AFB has to provide a safe, secure, and healthy environment to support the nuclear surety mission, as well as the Kirtland mission partners, and residents, while supporting the war fighter, without any interruption of critical infrastructure services.<br />Changeover from the current contract with CMSJV to a bridge contract with CMSJV will be transparent to Kirtland AFB in terms of contractor performance. Award of the bridge contract to another contractor will not produce seamless performance. The result would be degradation of Kirtland AFB's nuclear surety program and an interruption of services which Kirtland AFB cannot absorb and still meet its peacetime and wartime missions.</p>
<p>In summary, several contractors can perform these services on a long-term basis, as the October 2009 sources sought indicates; however, there is only one (1) contractor (CMSJV) who appears to be capable of performing these services on a short-term basis (i.e., bridge contract) with no service interruptions and without added investment and start-up costs.&emsp;</p>

<DESC>TheThe Bureau of Reclamation, Columbia-Cascades Area Office, Umatilla Field Office intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the Confederatied Tribes  of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR).
The purpose of this contract is to obtain assistance for the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) participation in fisheries monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities related to Umatilla Basin Project and Umatilla Project operations and maintenance (O&M). These M&E activities are associated with Endangered Species Act (ESA) non-discretionary actions as described in the 2004 NOAA Fisheries Biological Opinion (BiOp) and Essential Fisheries Habitat Consultation "Ongoing Operation of the Umatilla Project and the Umatilla Basin Project, Columbia River, Umatilla River, and McKay Creek, HUCs - 17070103 (Umatilla) and 17070101 (Middle Columbia-Lake Wallula), Umatilla and Morrow Counties, Oregon".The authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is implemented by FAR 6.302- 1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The cited authority must be used because it is the only practicable method of acquisition due to the nature of the supplies or services to be acquired as follows:CTUIR has the proven ability to conduct these specific work tasks which require designated staff, equipment, federal and state authorizations for handling ESA-listed steelhead, existing Umatilla River hatchery fish management plans, etc.CTUIR, which is a co-manager of fisheries in the Umatilla Basin, has requested to participate with specific monitoring tasks of Reclamation's M&E Program for steelhead from the Umatilla Hatchery Program. Consideration of other sources for the performance of the specific work requested during this time period do not exist for the following reasons. Other federal or state agencies (ODFW, FWS, USGS, Reclamation, etc) or other private contractors do not have the appropriate staff or equipment available within the Umatilla Basin during the required time period.  Most other sources do not have access to Umatilla River Hatchery Program steelhead, and also do not have access to hatchery fish acclimation sites in the upper Umatilla Basin.  Many other sources also do not currently possess, and cannot obtain within the designated timeframe for this work, the required federal and state authorizations for handling and conducting experiments with Umatilla Hatchery Program steelhead.This contract will commence on April 15, 2012 to facilitate the continued M & E of the Umatilla Basin.
A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Inquiries received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future, if the need arises.
Inquiries will be accepted no later than close of business April 10, 2012 via e-mail to cmorgan@usbr.gov

<a href="mailto:michelle.a.timmons.civ@mail.mil">DLA Aberdeen (ACC-APG)</a>
<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) not a request for proposal (RFP). The US Army Product Director, Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PD PNT) is seeking sources to provide a family of PNT solutions for US Army and Joint Service applications.  The common component of these items is a SAASM-based GPS receiver.<br><br>This RFI identifies multiple capabilities and interested parties are invited to respond to any or all of the PNT devices described below, or any portion of the devices described below.  The target date for contract award varies by the item described based on complexity of concept. <br><br>1) PNT HUB PHASE I  <br>     A sealed enclosure containing a SAASM-based GPS receiver for terrestrial applications (host platform) with connectors for external power, antenna and electrical interfaces.  Specific aerial applications may also be considered.  PNT Hub Phase I is intended to mimic the functionality of an AN/PSN-13A Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR) and not require any changes to host platform software currently utilizing DAGR as an external source of PNT data.  The connectors and external data interfaces shall be of the standard design utilized by DAGR such that the PNT Hub can effectively substitute for DAGR in a DAGR mount and connect to DAGR accessory cables. <br><br>     PNT Hub Phase I shall route PNT data for external devices with a minimum threshold of up to 3; objective up to 4.  A technical document identifying the sub-set of standard DAGR Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to PNT Hub Phase I is TBD.  This subset of technical documents is estimated to be 80% of the current full PRF and ICD.<br>Desired Product Availability - FY12.<br>   <br>2) PNT HUB PHASE II<br> A sealed enclosure containing a SAASM-based GPS receiver for terrestrial and potential aerial applications.  Connectors for external power, antenna and multiple electrical interfaces including Ethernet such that it can provide PNT capability on a host platform(s).  The PNT Hub Phase II would incorporate circuitry to prioritize and route PNT data with a minimum threshold of 6, objective greater than 6 external devices.  PNT capability enhancements are envisioned, to include, but not limited to:  precise timing devices (ie. chip scale atomic clock), inertial measurement units, external augmentation software, Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna/Anti-Jam antenna integration, etc.<br><br>     It is acknowledged that the PNT Hub Phase II may require modification of host platform software to accommodate the shared PNT source.  A technical document identifying the standard Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to PNT Hub Phase II is TBD.  The technical documents for PNT Hub Phase II will maintain the basic PNT functionality.  A COTS wireless interface (WiFi/Bluetooth) is contemplated for output of PNT data to external devices.<br> Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>3) EMBEDDABLE GPS RECEIVER IN MINI-GROUND BASED RECEIVER APPLICATIONS MODULE (MINI-GB-GRAM)<br>  <br>     A chip-mounted SAASM-based GPS receiver that can be integrated/embedded to a host platform mother board or delivered (optionally) installed to a circuit card such that it can substitute for an SSI-GB-GRAM in the Type II SSI form factor.  GRAM is an open architecture specification that provides a non-proprietary definition of hardware and software for embeddable SAASM-based GPS receivers. The current production item is the Small Serial Interface (SSI) GB-GRAM.  The Mini-GB-GRAM would supplement not replace the current production item and is intended for application that cannot be supported by the SSI-GB-GRAM due to size constraints.  The nominal dimensions of Mini-GB-GRAM are not to exceed 1.5 x 1.5 inches.<br><br>     The delivery option provides the opportunity to order Mini-GB-GRAM in a form factor that can substitute for current production item but not be limited to current design or interface parameters.  A technical document identifying the sub-set of standard GB-GRAM Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to Mini-GB-GRAM is TBD.  This subset of technical documents are estimated to be 60% of the current full PRF and ICD.  The potential for a family of products to support terrestrial, aerial and precision guided munitions domains are envisioned.  Separate products to support separate domains are acceptable.  <br> Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>4) SAASM INTEGRATION TO COMMERCIAL SMARTPHONE<br>PD PNT seeks input on how best to integrate SAASM to commercial smartphones, e.g., a cradle containing SAASM that would physically connect to a smartphone or a separate device containing SAASM that would interface wirelessly to the smartphone. <br>Key factors: <br><br> 	Use of IS-GPS-153 (open architecture) data constructs<br> 	Full IS-GPS-153 compliant messages is a desired feature<br> 	Use of commercial open architecture wired or wireless interfaces<br>             ~USB <br>             ~Bluetooth or WiFi <br> 	Wireless interface must support encryption<br> 	Smartphone OS is Android open source<br> 	A Droid app to interface with & control  the SAASM module is desired  <br>Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation to Bid, Request for Quotation or Request for Proposal.  Additionally there is no obligation on the part of the government to acquire any products described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.

The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes.

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the period of performance. Delivery of added items shall continue at the same rate that like items are called for under the contract, unless the parties otherwise agree.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>REFORESTATION AND CONTROL OF NUISANCE TREES</p>
<p>March 5, 2012</p>
<p>PART 1: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cut and treat boxelder trees</span></p>
<p>Boxelder trees are growing along the perimeter of several forest restoration sites. The areas with heavy boxelder cover are shown in Maps 1-3. Cut all boxelder within 100 feet of the field edge.</p>
<p>Boxelders under 6 inches diameter should be treated with herbicide. Using diesel fuel, fuel oil, kerosene or a commercial bark oil diluent, mix a 10% solution of Garlon 4, Element 4 or Tahoe 4 (active ingredient triclopyr). For a four gallon backpack tank this would be 0.4 gallon of Garlon or Tahoe 4 plus 3.6 gallons of diluent. Pathfinder II is triclopyr in a ready-to-use (RTU) form. It can be used for basal bark and cut stump treatment of boxelder. Spray from the base of the tree to a height of 12 to 15 inches from the ground.</p>
<p>Boxelder over 6 inches diameter will be cut low to the ground below any branching. The cut surface of the stump and 12 to 15 inches of the remaining bark will then be treated with herbicide.</p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers does not provide herbicide application equipment. Backpack sprayers are recommended for this task.</p>
<p>PART 2: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cut and treat trees on erosion control dam</span></p>
<p>Several species of trees are growing on the dam. See Map 1. All trees species, with the exception of aspen, should be cut and stump-treated with the same herbicide mix listed above. Trees should be cut on the top surface of the dam, as well as both the upstream and downstream slopes. As with boxelder, cut and treat the stump plus 12 to 15 inches of bark with triclopyr in bark oil diluents. For aspen (big tooth, quaking, cottonwood), do not cut the tree. Spray the lowest 15 inches of the bark, leaving the tree standing.</p>
<p>PART 3: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plant trees at Peterson Tract along Rush River</span></p>
<p>Collect 1,500 cuttings (live stakes) from live Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) saplings at location show on attached map. Plant cuttings shall be made from dormant spring season stock, prior to bud burst, and free from obvious signs of canker diseases. The diameter of each plant cutting shall be not less than 3/8 inch nor greater than &frac34; inch. The length of a plant cutting shall be a minimum length of 24 inches. Each planting cutting shall have at least four healthy buds. Cuttings must be planted within 24 hours on the adjacent planting area as indicated on attached map.</p>
<p>Prepare 3,000 tree planting spots within a 15.7 acre area of land by using power weed trimmers to remove vegetation from a minimum 3' x 3' area. Space the planting spots approximately 15' from adjacent spots or from previously planted tree seedlings.</p>
<p>Plant 1,500 cottonwood cuttings and approximately 1,500 bareroot and/or potted tree seedlings within the planting spots spaced relatively evenly throughout the 15.7 acres. Cuttings must be planted with live buds pointing up, a minimum of &frac12; to 2/3rds of cutting length below the soil surface, and healed-in properly to maximize soil contact around the subsurface portion of the cutting. Bare root and/or potted tree seedlings will be furnished by the Government and also planted randomly within the tree planting spots (1 seedling or cutting per spot). Proper care must be given to ensure seedling roots and cuttings are protected from heat and/or drying from the time they are removed from packaging or cut, until they are planted in the ground.</p>
<p>Install weed barrier mats (3' x 3' fabric provided by the Government) around each planted cutting and seedling using 5 landscape staples (also provided by the Government) per mat. Also install provided spiral wrap tree protectors on any RPM seedlings.</p>
<p>PART 4: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plant trees at Pool 8 Islands near Brownsville, MN</span></p>
<p>Assist the Government and other volunteers in preparing tree planting spots on approximately 15 acres of newly constructed islands within the Mississippi River by using power weed trimmers to remove vegetation from a minimum 3' x 3' area. Space the planting spots from adjacent spots or from previously planted tree seedlings as per direction from the Government Site Coordinator.</p>
<p>Plant cuttings, bareroot and/or potted tree seedlings within the planting spots spaced relatively evenly throughout the 15 acres. Cuttings must be planted with live buds pointing up, a minimum of &frac12; to 2/3rds of cutting length below the soil surface, and healed-in properly to maximize soil contact around the subsurface portion of the cutting. Cuttings, bareroot and/or potted tree seedlings will be furnished by the Government and also planted within the tree planting spots (1 seedling or cutting per spot) as per direction from the Government Site Coordinator. Proper care must be given to ensure seedling roots and cuttings are protected from heat and/or drying from the time they are removed from packaging until they are planted in the ground.</p>
<p>Install weed barrier mats (3' x 3' fabric provided by the Government) around each planted cutting and seedling using 5 landscape staples (also provided by the Government) per mat. Also install provided spiral wrap tree protectors on any RPM seedlings.</p>
<p>Boat transportation to and from the island tree planting sites will be provided by the Government.</p>

<p>Coast Guard Acquisition Procedures (CGAP)<br />APPENDIX C - CHAPTER 3033 <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester shall file a formal agency protest both the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, and Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester shall file a formal agency protest to both the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, and the&nbsp;Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Closing date for receipt of quotations is Apr 10, 2012, 4:00 P.M. EST. Submit to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, MRS Product Line, Elizabeth City, NC, ATTN; Denise Coley, (252) 335-6562, denise.m.coley@uscg.mil. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>Closing date for receipt of quotations is Apr 10, 2012, 4:00 P.M. EST. Submit to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, MRS Product Line, Elizabeth City, NC, ATTN; Denise Coley, (252) 335-6562, denise.m.coley@uscg.mil. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Commandant (CG-931)</p>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<DESC>2 Apr 12:&nbsp; "(see enclosure 1 for equipment list)" is deleted.&nbsp; Equipment list will be posted with solicitation.<br /><br />30 Mar 12:&nbsp; Sources Sought <br />A. INTRODUCTION <br />1. This is a Sources Sought synopsis being conducted pursuant to FAR Part 10, Market Research. This is for planning purposes only and there is no solicitation available at this time. <br />2. This is an initial step in the planning process for the Electromagnetic Opposing Force acquisition currently titled EM OPFOR. <br />3. The 55th Contracting Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, seeks to identify potential sources to provide Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) expertise and Electromagnetic Spectrum Opposing Force (EM OPFOR) engineering services to the USSTRATCOM Joint Electronic Warfare Center (JEWC) EM OPFOR mission located at Lackland AFB, TX. The mission of the EM OPFOR is to replicate a coherent, realistic EM environment (EME) capable of mirroring adversary and civilian infrastructure in order to train and enhance EM capabilities, processes, and TTP proficiency across the Department of Defense (DOD) and USG, and produce comprehensive after-action reports (AAR) from the findings of these activities/assessments. United States (US) forces must train in a realistic environment as mandated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CJCSI 3500-series joint instructions. The EM OPFOR allows US forces to do that by providing an EME that is representative of what the warfighter will see when deployed (i.e. congested and contested EMS). The EM OPFOR is the dynamic and technically advanced adversary in exercise scenarios (i.e. the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo;). The EM OPFOR deploys to austere locations (training ranges, test facilities, etc.) and creates realistic EME where before there was nothing; thus allowing full spectrum, joint, live-virtual-constructive EM activities to take place. The EM OPFOR deploys and operates current/emergent wireless communications and network technologies to include but not limited to VHF/UHF radios, satellite communications, cellular communications (e.g. GSM, CDMA, EVDO, HSDPA, etc.), wireless communications and devices (e.g. WiFi, WiMAX, cameras, survey tools). They design, implement and operate adversary command, control, communications and computer (C4) architectures in support of customer requirements. EM OPFOR also operates Electronic Warfare Support (ES)/Electronic Attack (EA)/Radio Frequency Direction Finding (RFDF) equipment in order to prosecute US forces and assess potential US vulnerabilities. Moreover, the EM OPFOR is involved in most aspects of the joint exercise life cycle (JELC) specifically: exercise scenario development, scripting, execution oversight, scenario injects and debrief. <br />4. The North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541330 , Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons), which has a small business size standard of $35.5M. <br />B. CAPABILITY PACKAGE AND EVALUATION: The Government will identify competitive firms by evaluating the capabilities packages using the following evaluation criteria. Potential offerors should be specific in referring to capabilities in the technical areas stated below. <br />The following is considered mandatory in meeting the requirements of the EM OPFOR contract: The company/teaming arrangement must posses the knowledge and ability to: 1. Target set infrastructure development and deployment, electronic monitoring, RFDF signal intercepts, intrusion and vulnerability assessment support <br />2. OPFOR C4 architectures scalable to meet customer requirements in support of exercises and real world operations and determine, develop, and replicate credible hostile electronic warfare support (ES) activities utilizing COTS/GOTS equipment. <br />3. Research on threat systems and capabilities. Review and analyze all source intelligence data up to and including TS/SCI and other government furnished access classified to ensure accurate threat representation in all projects. <br />4. Conduct studies of systems and methodologies employed during a customer&rsquo;s operations to identify common/critical vulnerabilities. <br />5. Develop an implementation plan based on vulnerability studies, C4 target sets and friendly force exploitation plan (as required) based on research of associated systems.<br />a. Assess the RF vulnerability aspect through the use of adversarial intelligence gathering techniques. <br />b. Determine, develop, and replicate credible hostile ES/EA threat utilizing COTS/GOTS equipment. <br />c. Research, assess, develop, and replicate a credible C4 threat utilizing all available means. Mirror disposition, organization and current/future capabilities of potential and/or actual adversaries and describe in the target set and exploitation plan. <br />6. In-the-field repair and maintenance of equipment and other field operation facilities as required for supporting projects. <br />7. Participate in data reduction and analysis following project execution, to include such activities as: <br />a. Provide data collection results (from various means) including ground truth, exploitable signals, methodology, and key events, to project analytical organization in a written report. <br />b. Provide verbal or written feedback (as required), regarding analysis of EW issues, which arise during project execution. <br />c. Participate in lessons learned data collection and analysis following project execution. Results shall be incorporated into the Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS) or similar database and shared with USSTRATCOM. <br />d. Provide a technical report documenting methods of employing emergent technologies used during operations or exercises in the form of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) used to identify gaps in current TTPs or capability shortfalls.<br />8. Develop training material (primarily Power Point presentations) for quarterly, short training courses to approximately fifteen (15) students on wireless and emerging technologies describing the technology, how an adversary potentially can use the technology, and how it applies to DOD/USG. <br />9. Ability to support deployments to hazardous areas. <br />10. Provide personnel with a TOP SECRET and/or Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI/NC2/SAP/SAR) clearance. <br />C. INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS: <br />1. All businesses capable of providing all of the mandatory evaluation criteria within their teaming arrangements are invited to respond. For the EM OPFOR requirement to be restricted to small business competition as a small business set-aside, market research and the results from the capability packages must show there is viable competition among two or more small businesses able to demonstrate the ability to provide all the above EM OPFOR tasks mandatory criteria within their teaming arrangements. The Prime small business must be able to provide at least 50% of the services to be considered small business.

<DESC>2 Apr 12:&nbsp; This will be a follow-on contract to Red Cell Team, GSA contract&nbsp; GS-10F-0095T, awarded on task order FA7037-08-F-0054, 30 Jul 2008 to MacAulay Brown, Inc., by AF ISR Agency/A7KA, 102 Hall Blvd Ste 258, San Antonio, TX&nbsp; 78243-7030.<br /><br />2 Apr 12:&nbsp; "(see enclosure 1 for equipment list)" is deleted.&nbsp; Equipment list will be posted with solicitation.<br /><br />30 Mar 12:&nbsp; Sources Sought <br />A. INTRODUCTION <br />1. This is a Sources Sought synopsis being conducted pursuant to FAR Part 10, Market Research. This is for planning purposes only and there is no solicitation available at this time. <br />2. This is an initial step in the planning process for the Electromagnetic Opposing Force acquisition currently titled EM OPFOR. <br />3. The 55th Contracting Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, seeks to identify potential sources to provide Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) expertise and Electromagnetic Spectrum Opposing Force (EM OPFOR) engineering services to the USSTRATCOM Joint Electronic Warfare Center (JEWC) EM OPFOR mission located at Lackland AFB, TX. The mission of the EM OPFOR is to replicate a coherent, realistic EM environment (EME) capable of mirroring adversary and civilian infrastructure in order to train and enhance EM capabilities, processes, and TTP proficiency across the Department of Defense (DOD) and USG, and produce comprehensive after-action reports (AAR) from the findings of these activities/assessments. United States (US) forces must train in a realistic environment as mandated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CJCSI 3500-series joint instructions. The EM OPFOR allows US forces to do that by providing an EME that is representative of what the warfighter will see when deployed (i.e. congested and contested EMS). The EM OPFOR is the dynamic and technically advanced adversary in exercise scenarios (i.e. the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo;). The EM OPFOR deploys to austere locations (training ranges, test facilities, etc.) and creates realistic EME where before there was nothing; thus allowing full spectrum, joint, live-virtual-constructive EM activities to take place. The EM OPFOR deploys and operates current/emergent wireless communications and network technologies to include but not limited to VHF/UHF radios, satellite communications, cellular communications (e.g. GSM, CDMA, EVDO, HSDPA, etc.), wireless communications and devices (e.g. WiFi, WiMAX, cameras, survey tools). They design, implement and operate adversary command, control, communications and computer (C4) architectures in support of customer requirements. EM OPFOR also operates Electronic Warfare Support (ES)/Electronic Attack (EA)/Radio Frequency Direction Finding (RFDF) equipment in order to prosecute US forces and assess potential US vulnerabilities. Moreover, the EM OPFOR is involved in most aspects of the joint exercise life cycle (JELC) specifically: exercise scenario development, scripting, execution oversight, scenario injects and debrief. <br />4. The North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541330 , Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons), which has a small business size standard of $35.5M. <br />B. CAPABILITY PACKAGE AND EVALUATION: The Government will identify competitive firms by evaluating the capabilities packages using the following evaluation criteria. Potential offerors should be specific in referring to capabilities in the technical areas stated below. <br />The following is considered mandatory in meeting the requirements of the EM OPFOR contract: The company/teaming arrangement must posses the knowledge and ability to: 1. Target set infrastructure development and deployment, electronic monitoring, RFDF signal intercepts, intrusion and vulnerability assessment support <br />2. OPFOR C4 architectures scalable to meet customer requirements in support of exercises and real world operations and determine, develop, and replicate credible hostile electronic warfare support (ES) activities utilizing COTS/GOTS equipment. <br />3. Research on threat systems and capabilities. Review and analyze all source intelligence data up to and including TS/SCI and other government furnished access classified to ensure accurate threat representation in all projects. <br />4. Conduct studies of systems and methodologies employed during a customer&rsquo;s operations to identify common/critical vulnerabilities. <br />5. Develop an implementation plan based on vulnerability studies, C4 target sets and friendly force exploitation plan (as required) based on research of associated systems.<br />a. Assess the RF vulnerability aspect through the use of adversarial intelligence gathering techniques. <br />b. Determine, develop, and replicate credible hostile ES/EA threat utilizing COTS/GOTS equipment. <br />c. Research, assess, develop, and replicate a credible C4 threat utilizing all available means. Mirror disposition, organization and current/future capabilities of potential and/or actual adversaries and describe in the target set and exploitation plan. <br />6. In-the-field repair and maintenance of equipment and other field operation facilities as required for supporting projects. <br />7. Participate in data reduction and analysis following project execution, to include such activities as: <br />a. Provide data collection results (from various means) including ground truth, exploitable signals, methodology, and key events, to project analytical organization in a written report. <br />b. Provide verbal or written feedback (as required), regarding analysis of EW issues, which arise during project execution. <br />c. Participate in lessons learned data collection and analysis following project execution. Results shall be incorporated into the Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS) or similar database and shared with USSTRATCOM. <br />d. Provide a technical report documenting methods of employing emergent technologies used during operations or exercises in the form of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) used to identify gaps in current TTPs or capability shortfalls.<br />8. Develop training material (primarily Power Point presentations) for quarterly, short training courses to approximately fifteen (15) students on wireless and emerging technologies describing the technology, how an adversary potentially can use the technology, and how it applies to DOD/USG. <br />9. Ability to support deployments to hazardous areas. <br />10. Provide personnel with a TOP SECRET and/or Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI/NC2/SAP/SAR) clearance. <br />C. INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS: <br />1. All businesses capable of providing all of the mandatory evaluation criteria within their teaming arrangements are invited to respond.

<DESC><p>This announcement serves as notice the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Systems Directorate at Los Angeles AFB, CA anticipates issuance of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation for a study, to include concept development and component level demonstration, on the feasibility and affordability of using existing and/or narrowly modified commercial protected satellite communication (SATCOM) systems to support future protected MILSATCOM needs. SMC will consider alternative protected MILSATCOM design concepts that modify the placement of processing functions associated with a robust, Lower Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) and anti-jam frequency-hopped spread-spectrum system (FHSS) between the space, terminal and/or ground segments relative to traditional highly protected MILSATCOM system designs. SMC is soliciting proposals to architect, prototype, and demonstrate specific elements of such protected MILSATCOM design concepts focused on improved life-cycle affordability. SMC has identified elements of the space, ground, and terminal segments for risk reduction activities. This acquisition will be conducted on a Full and Open Competitive basis in accordance with the procurement procedures outlined in FAR 35.016, "Broad Agency Announcement." This effort involves the concept development and demonstration of tasks over three phases: Phase I: Design Concept Development and Demonstration; Phase II: Design Concept Demonstration and Validation, and Phase III: Interoperability Demonstration. Phases II and III will be options under any resulting contract. The anticipated period of performance for all three phases, if exercised, is 24 months. Multiple awards are possible. The Government may award some, all, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by SMC. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517410. The small business size standard is $15 Million. Small and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to participate. Foreign firms are advised they will not be allowed to participate in this effort. The anticipated release of the BAA solicitation will be early to mid April 2012.</p>
<p>FBO.gov will be utilized to transmit the BAA and all attachments, thus, there is no longer a need to submit written requests for a copy of the BAA as previously instructed in this synopsis.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Synopsis:<br /></strong>The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) seeks information for the purpose of obtaining access to leading edge Trusted Foundry (TF) services for meeting US Government (USG) requirements beginning in October 2013. This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. If a solicitation is released by DMEA, it will be synopsized in the FedBizOpps. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Further, neither DMEA nor the USG will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.</p>
<p><strong>Background:<br /></strong>The DoD and other USG entities require access to a wide range of microelectronics services. Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of specialized military devices) has become increasingly challenging owing to the globalization of the integrated circuit (IC) industry.</p>
<p>The DoD Trusted Foundry Program was established to ensure mission-critical national defense systems can obtain classified (up to the SECRET level and may include NOFORN and COMSEC) and unclassified Trusted ICs, such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), from sources that have the capability to protect the confidentiality and integrity of these devices. The TF program includes accreditation of trusted sources for design, aggregation, mask manufacturing, wafer fabrication, post-processing, packaging/assembly, test, and broker services. A list of the currently accredited suppliers can be found at the DMEA website. (Ref 1) Trusted ICs require the use of trusted services throughout the supply chain. A key requirement includes access to TF capabilities (mask and wafer fabrication) for leading edge and state-of-the-art semiconductor process technologies. The DoD and NSA have requirements that include military temperature ranges and radiation hardness requirements; developing libraries and/or processes to support these needs may be required. TF access will be required by 1 October 2013 when an existing contract for such services (Ref 2) reaches the end of its contractual period of performance. Based on previously observed demand, a minimum of approximately 1200 wafers per year (8-inch equivalent) will be required from a state-of-the-art TF to fulfill USG ASIC needs. Additional quantities of wafers might also be required to supply the DoD with other types of Trusted devices (e.g., processors, FPGAs, etc.) as required by policy and effective program protection.</p>
<p>Trusted suppliers must possess and maintain a SECRET facility security clearance (Ref 3), an ISO-9001 quality system certification for any manufacturing or assembly work, and otherwise protect all trusted designs and devices with a cleared chain-of-custody (a cadre of individuals who possess personnel security clearances) including, as applicable, computer systems accredited by Defense Security Service (DSS) for processing classified information (Ref 4). DMEA works closely with trusted supplier applicants to implement security protocols for trusted services without requiring changes to ordinary commercial services. Accreditation by DMEA as a trusted supplier is required prior to performing work as a trusted foundry. Qualified companies are encouraged to contact DMEA to obtain a complete set of requirements. <br /><br /><strong>Draft Acquisition Approach: <br /></strong>&bull; 5-year contract (maximum term currently allowed)<br />&bull; Alternative business models such as Prime, Prime with Subcontractors, and&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaming will be considered <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Foundry as Prime Contractor approach<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Aggregator as Prime Contractor approach<br />&bull; Possible multi-award award indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (ID/IQ)</p>
<p><strong>Approach A: Foundry as Prime Contractor</strong> - This approach awards a contract to a TF or foundries to satisfy the requirements. Awardees would have to show how internal capabilities or a third party arrangement (e.g., with an aggregator) would be used.</p>
<p><strong>Approach B: Aggregator as Prime Contractor</strong> - This approach awards a contract to an aggregator(s) and allows them to partner with leading edge foundry(s) to satisfy the requirements. Customers (from the DoD, USG, and from their defense contractors) would access these leading edge TF services via a Trusted Aggregator, which may or may not be a third party. Awardees would have to show how internal capabilities and third party partnering (e.g., with one or more foundries) would be used.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Requirements (all must meet Trust and ITAR requirements)<br /><br /></strong>1) Access to leading edge and state-of-the-art CMOS (&le;65nm) technologies<br />2) Provisions to provide timely access to leading edge and state-of-the-art <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SiGe BiCMOS technologies as technologies advance..<br />3) Trusted aggregation services for a Multi-Project Wafer (MPW) program for <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R&amp;D and prototype development for both Trusted and Untrusted <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requirements<br />4) Dedicated prototype runs<br />5) Production runs<br />6) Ability to produce or otherwise obtain Trusted masks as needed for these <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purposes<br />7) Design kits and libraries for use by the USG and its contractors<br />8) Access to complete ASIC services (including design, fabrication, packaging,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;test)<br />9) Test, failure analysis, design, and technology support services for users of fabrication technologies<br /><br /><strong>Desired Objectives (Goals)<br /></strong>1) Trusted access to other leading edge and state-of-the-art microelectronics <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; technologies to be identified by respondent/offeror<br />2) Approaches to retarget untrusted FPGA devices and designs to trusted <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supply chains (DoD accredited suppliers) via prime, partner, or <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subcontractor.<br />3) Extension of trust access to other categories of components (e.g., <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; microprocessors, graphics processors, digital signal processors, analog to <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digital converters, photonics, MEMS, etc.).<br />4) Ability to provide and to license intellectual property (IP)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Design IP (including third party IP) and flexibilities in licensing/use <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrangements.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Process and tools IP for use by the DoD/DMEA for USG purposes (e.g., to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sustain weapon systems when processes are no longer available to the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DoD from trusted sources).<br />5) Access to research pertaining to performance of contract goals.<br /><br /><strong>Specific information being sought from industry for each of the minimum requirements and desired objectives listed above:<br /><br /></strong>1) Ability to meet each of the minimum requirements and desired objectives.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be specific and identify issues<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Identify the technologies to be made available<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i) Provide a technology roadmap with timeline for availability (NSA and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoD have requirements spanning legacy to leading edge <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; semiconductor technologies).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii) Describe how these new technologies could be made available to users <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once the technologies come online without contract modification while<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maintaining compliance with acquisition laws/regulations<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Discuss familiarity and feasibility of entering contracts with the USG or <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoD.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Discuss potential contract and pricing arrangements, including a multiple<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; award indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract. <br />2) Feasibility of forming partnerships/teams to address the entire scope of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;requirements and objectives. <br />3) Discuss any alternate acquisition approaches to be considered that would be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of interest to potential foundry/mask/aggregator/FPGA teams, including<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;any alternate customer-centric engagement model versus the current<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Government-centric model.<br /><br />The anticipated NAICS code is: 334413.

REQUIREMENTS FOR A/E SERVICES
FOR PROJECT 586-12-202
CONDUCT SITE STUDY OF UNDERGROUND
WATER & SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE

GENERAL SCOPE:  The primary focus of the work is to provide an in-depth study of the facilitys underground water and sewer utilities to provide complete investigation and upgrade recommendations for these site utilities at the G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery VA Medical Center campus, Jackson, MS.  The study will include, but not limited to, information gathering, site investigation, and system design.  The evaluation shall note any deficiencies within the systems and provide recommendations for corrections.  
The existing water service includes an 8 main loop around the facility site with several taps to feed into various the buildings.  The water loop also feeds the site fire protection system (including both fire hydrants and building fire protection systems, through post indicator valves (PIV) and fire pumps).  The existing loop is connected to the facilitys well and elevated tank system, as well as two city water main feeds (valves are currently closed to city mains, connection is for emergency backup only). [Water loop is ~4600 in length, with approximately 5 building feeds, 6 PIV fire connections (including 2 fire pump feeds), and 10 fire hydrants]
The facility sewer system is divided into separate sanitary and storm sewer systems.  The sanitary sewer ranges in size from 8 to 12, serves all the facility buildings, and connects to a single point of discharge from the site.  There is approximately 4000 of sanitary lines serving the site, connected thru approximately 27 manholes.  The storm sewer system ranges from 6 to 36 and discharges from the buildings in multiple, decentralized feeds into various collection and run-off locations.  There is approximately 8000 of storm sewer serving the site, connected thru approximately 20 manholes.   
A.	Conduct necessary site survey to identify extents and locations of the underground water and sewer systems.  In addition, perform required survey to identify all utilities, roads, sidewalks, curbs, and other features that would affect the design of replacement system components or system repair services.  
B.	Perform sewer pipe camera inspection of all exterior storm and sanitary mains.  Confirm location of manholes, clean-outs, etc.  Provide a complete report, including a video record, which identifies all damaged sections or potential problems within the system.  
C.	Provide plans and specifications for work required to repair (either by sleeving or replacement) of items identified by the above sewer system inspection.
D.	Provide plans and specifications for design of a replacement domestic water distribution loop.  New system to include, but is not limited to, new backflow preventers and meters at connections to City of Jackson mains, connections to all existing building feeds/fire service feeds, and connection to the existing well and elevated tank system.  New distribution system to be constructed with C900 piping and mechanical joint fittings (or an alternative piping system, upon VA approval).  Evaluate existing demands and potential future needs (of up to 250,000 square feet of building addition) to properly size the new loop.  
E.	All repair or replacement design shall include all road patching, sidewalk/curb/gutter replacement, and road/parking striping, as required by the installation work.
F.	Distribution loop design shall include multiple isolation valves, throughout the loop, to allow for sections of loop to be isolated for repairs, while minimizing the overall system disruption.
G.	Distribution loop design shall be modular in nature to allow for installation of sections in multiple, smaller phases, over time as allowed by future funding availability. 

TIME SCHEDULE, REVIEW, AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: The following specifies the materials to be submitted by the A/E to the project manager for review and due dates for the submission.  Timeframes are approximate and will be finalized during contract negotiations.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage serves as an alternative if the FBO website is unavailable.  The Naval Sea Systems Command and various ordering activities designated in Basic Ordering Agreement N00024-10-G-4315 and Basic Ordering Agreement N00024-10-G-4316 plan to issue multiple orders with Electric Boat Corporation, 75 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT 06340-4905 and Newport News Shipbuilding, 4101 Washington Avenue, Newport News, VA 23607 for unique parts held by these companies.
  This class synopsis will cover multiple orders issued through 30 September 2011 to include line items for emergent USS SEAWOLF (SSN 21) and USS VIRGINIA (SSN 774) Class Submarine Shipbuilder Coded Stock Unique Parts and Specialized Materials not otherwise available through regular purchasing channel or the Navy Supply System in time to meet mission requirements. 

Procurements under this class synopsis will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C.  2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

 [The Government does not possess the Level III drawing package, specifications, and test procedures to allow for full and open competition.  These procurements are unique to the USS SEAWOLF Class (SSN 21) and USS VIRGINIA Class (SSN 774) submarines and must integrate precisely with existing equipment in terms of form, fit, function, and compatibility.

POC for information regarding this requirement is Marina Atchison, telephone 202-781-3039 or email marina.atchison@navy.mil.  E-Mail request is preferred.  These requirements will be negotiated on a sole source basis with Electric Boat Corporation in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>This is a NAVSUP WSS synopsis for the two year extension (from 1 April 2012 to 1 April 2014) of  Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00383-09-G-004H for the repair of various components used as part of the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) used on the F18.  Vision Systems International (VSI) CAGE code 06VL3, San Jose, CA, is the only know source to possess full repair capability.  The following are the top high dollar value items for repair:  Power supply 01-460-8882, Helmet Display Unit 01-469-6497, Single Processor 01-564-8181,  01-563-4028, Cable Assembly 01-495-1189, 01-495-1190, Cable Assembly 01-495-1191, HMDTS 01-494-6768.  

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained by calling the NAVSUP WSS PCO.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

These states are particularly challenged by the persistent HIV/AIDS epidemic; trade liberalization creating the need to operate in highly competitive open markets; adverse effects of a changing global climate; increased international drug trafficking and an alarming rise in youth violent crime. Added to this menu of mounting issues, the sub-region has been on the receiving end of the global recession, which has caused painful economic contraction reducing government revenues and spending, business profits, employment and personal incomes. The region's vulnerability to multiple forms of natural disasters places further stress on these fragile economies and exposes their populations to grave physical risk. </span></p>

This development assistance strategy comprises four pillars - combating HIV/AIDS, pursuing economic growth through creating economic opportunities for youth, addressing deficiencies in rule of law and juvenile justice, and assisting the region to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. This assistance is focused on the six independent states of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)&nbsp;and Barbados, with additional Caribbean Regional Partnership Framework HIV/AIDS and Caribbean Basin Security Initiative activities carried out in Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and in Guyana as that USAID Mission closes during 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Work shall include the complete rehabilitation of steel tainter gates at Oahe Dam, South Dakota. There are 8 gates that measure 50 feet wide by 23.5 feet high. <br><br>Work shall include but not be limited to: visual Hydraulic Steel Structure (HSS) inspection of stoplogs and tainter gates, 3-D modeling and analysis utilizing STAAD.Pro software, non-destructive testing, structural repair design, welding (per AWS D1.5M/D1.5), corrosion repair, sandblasting, lead-based paint removal over/near water, wire rope replacement, concrete spall repair, gate seal replacement, concrete construction joint material replacement, cathodic protection removal and installation, design and replacement of hoist controls and switches, localized dredging and certified diving. This work may be subcontracted out to other specialty contractors, as required. <br><br>The Oahe project office has one set of spillway stoplogs (8 total measuring 3 feet high by 53 feet wide). Typically, due to water elevations, only one, maybe two gates can be isolated at one time. Therefore, work shall be sequenced to be performed while the stoplogs are in place. The contractor shall have the option of fabricating temporary stoplog structures and/or working multiple shifts. <br><br>The spillway stoplog slots have accumulated a significant amount of sediment. In order to seat the stoplogs, this contract will require localized dredging of the stoplog slots and sill. Dredging shall be accomplished via water jetting, excavation or other approved methods and properly dispose of the collected sediment. A certified diver is required to verify dredging operations have been effective enough to properly seat the stoplogs. <br><br>Painting work shall include sandblasting spillway gates and associated features to commercial blast, preparing the final surface to SSPC 5 (white metal) and final coating the gates with a vinyl (5-E-Z) coating system with a zinc primer. Work may require the use of scaffolding, snooper crane and harness access. Contractor shall be responsible for dewatering, if required. There will be approximately 1175 square feet of paint required per side per gate with additional quantities for other related features. Taking gates off-site is prohibited. <br><br>Work may require torch cutting and grinding of new holes for drainage including a structural analysis for altering the gate. Experience in design/analysis of Hydraulic Steel Structures (HSS) is required. Inspection of the structural integrity of the structural members of the gates, including the skin, will be required. Analysis and design of structural repairs and/or replacement of structural members that have been damaged, or severely corroded, may be required. <br><br>The painting of the gate and associated features is considered the most critical aspect of this project. Contractors will be required to show successful completion of similar projects utilizing 5-E-Z vinyl painting system. Contractors shall have QP-1 and QP-2 Contractor Certifications. Painting qualifications may be amended at a later date.<br><br>Coating contractor shall be required to hire an independent third party inspector that is NACE-CIP 3, PCS or SSPC-PCI 3 certified. <br><br>Confined spaces may be a consideration. <br><br>Please note: Other contractors may be performing work simultaneously in the same general vicinity of the gate work. Contractors will be required to coordinate with other contractors and dam personnel. <br><br>The estimated construction cost of this project is between $5,000,000 and $7,500,000. <br><br>_____________________________________________________________________________<br><br>The Contractor will be required to commence work within 10 days after notice to proceed and complete the work 720 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed.

<DESC>NOTE: Please note the change in the submission requirements. One original and four copies of the SF 330 Parts I and II are now required instead of the original two copies requested originally. <br><br>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Division Middle East District (TAM) intends to award in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act, as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6, up to six (6), but no less than two (2), A-E Design Services SATOCs, with an estimated overall capacity of $240 million. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  Up to six awards may be issued up to one year from the date of the release of this FBO announcement.  The period of performance for each SATOC shall include one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods, for an overall performance period of five years.  The total capacity may be used at any time throughout the life of the contract and the Government reserves the right to move the capacity forward as necessary to meet operational needs.  Options will be exercised in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract."  Only firms who are committed to working on-site and in-country, either as the prime firm or with subcontractors, in all regions and areas within TAM's AOR, including Iraq and Afghanistan, will be considered for this solicitation. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330. Projected contract award date is August/September 2012 for the initial one-year period. It is the Government's intent to make multiple contract awards under a single solicitation. Each contract will have a guaranteed minimum amount of $5,000.00 for each of the awarded SATOCs. All large business firms, selected for this contract, must comply with FAR 52.219-9, "Small Business Subcontracting Plan," regarding the requirement for an acceptable subcontracting plan. The plan is not required to be included in the information submitted in response to this announcement. Work will be issued by task order, either cost-reimbursable, firm fixed-pr ice or labor-hour.  It is TAM's intent to issue most task orders as firm fixed-price actions. The task orders are anticipated to be equally distributed among the design firms; however, this distribution may change depending upon the changing needs and contingency environment of TAM's AOR. TAM's AOR has traditionally paralleled the CENTCOM AOR, which includes the Middle East, the Arabian Gulf states, portions of Southwest and Central Asia, and portions of Africa. TAM's mission has further expanded to include several new worldwide programs, including the Center of Standardization for Contingency Standard Designs, the Technical Center of Expertise for Aircraft Hangar Fire Protection, and Satellite Communications.  Based on TAM's newly acquired missions, it is projected that the Design Services Architect-Engineer Contracts will include all locations where TAM has been designated program manager.  While the primary focus of this contract will be on work within the CENTCOM region, the A-E firm must be able to perform work throughout TAM's AOR, including the locations for TAM's newly acquired worldwide missions.  The A-E firm must be willing to service locations worldwide including performing site visits.  TAM subcontracting goals are as follows: (a) 7% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with small business concerns; (b) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by HUBZones; (c) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by Service-Disabled Veterans; (d) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantage individuals; (e) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by women.  Contractor compliance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be monitored through regular submission of reports into the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).  This plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.  NOTE: All firms should be aware of the limitations of DFARS 236.602-70. This clause requires that A-E contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are estimated to exceed $500,000, and are to be performed in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, can only be awarded to United States firms or to joint ventures of United States and host nation firms. TAM's AOR contains many countries that border on the Arabian Gulf such as Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Saudi Arabia. In fact, the majority of the countries where TAM has a current presence and construction work border the Arabian Gulf. Consequently, while this acquisition is to be issued as full and open to allow for the greatest amount of competition among qualified A-E firms, it is noted that at least 50%, if not more, of the task orders to be awarded (and, consequently, a majority of the total dollar value of task order awards) under the new A-E IDCs will be limited to U.S firms or joint ventures involving U.S. firms.  2.

<DESC>NOTE: Please note the change in the submission requirements. One original and four copies of the SF 330 Parts I and II are now required instead of the original two copies requested originally. <br><br>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Division Middle East District (TAM) intends to award in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act, as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6, up to six (6), but no less than two (2), A-E Design Services SATOCs, with an estimated overall capacity of $240 million. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  Up to six awards may be issued up to one year from the date of the release of this FBO announcement.  The period of performance for each SATOC shall include one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods, for an overall performance period of five years.  The total capacity may be used at any time throughout the life of the contract and the Government reserves the right to move the capacity forward as necessary to meet operational needs.  Options will be exercised in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract."  Only firms who are committed to working on-site and in-country, either as the prime firm or with subcontractors, in all regions and areas within TAM's AOR, including Iraq and Afghanistan, will be considered for this solicitation. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330. Projected contract award date is August/September 2012 for the initial one-year period. It is the Government's intent to make multiple contract awards under a single solicitation. Each contract will have a guaranteed minimum amount of $5,000.00 for each of the awarded SATOCs. All large business firms, selected for this contract, must comply with FAR 52.219-9, "Small Business Subcontracting Plan," regarding the requirement for an acceptable subcontracting plan. The plan is not required to be included in the information submitted in response to this announcement. Work will be issued by task order, either cost-reimbursable, firm fixed-pr ice or labor-hour.  It is TAM's intent to issue most task orders as firm fixed-price actions. The task orders are anticipated to be equally distributed among the design firms; however, this distribution may change depending upon the changing needs and contingency environment of TAM's AOR. TAM's AOR has traditionally paralleled the CENTCOM AOR, which includes the Middle East, the Arabian Gulf states, portions of Southwest and Central Asia, and portions of Africa. TAM's mission has further expanded to include several new worldwide programs, including the Center of Standardization for Contingency Standard Designs, the Technical Center of Expertise for Aircraft Hangar Fire Protection, and Satellite Communications.  Based on TAM's newly acquired missions, it is projected that the Design Services Architect-Engineer Contracts will include all locations where TAM has been designated program manager.  While the primary focus of this contract will be on work within the CENTCOM region, the A-E firm must be able to perform work throughout TAM's AOR, including the locations for TAM's newly acquired worldwide missions.  The A-E firm must be willing to service locations worldwide including performing site visits.  TAM subcontracting goals are as follows: (a) 7% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with small business concerns; (b) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by HUBZones; (c) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by Service-Disabled Veterans; (d) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantage individuals; (e) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by women.  Contractor compliance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be monitored through regular submission of reports into the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).  This plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.  NOTE: All firms should be aware of the limitations of DFARS 236.602-70. This clause requires that A-E contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are estimated to exceed $500,000, and are to be performed in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, can only be awarded to United States firms or to joint ventures of United States and host nation firms. TAM's AOR contains many countries that border on the Arabian Gulf such as Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Saudi Arabia. In fact, the majority of the countries where TAM has a current presence and construction work border the Arabian Gulf. Consequently, while this acquisition is to be issued as full and open to allow for the greatest amount of competition among qualified A-E firms, it is noted that at least 50%, if not more, of the task orders to be awarded (and, consequently, a majority of the total dollar value of task order awards) under the new A-E IDCs will be limited to U.S firms or joint ventures involving U.S. firms.  2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Primary facility designs may include, but are not be limited to, the following: A05 and A06 Airports including airport lighting and terminals and hangers; A09 Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection; B01 Barracks, Dormitories; D04 Design-Build-preparation of Requests for Proposals; D07 Dining Halls, Clubs, Restaurants; D08 Dredging Studies and Design; F01 Blast-Resistant Design; F03 Fire Protection; G01 Garages, Vehicle Maintenance Facilities; H01 Harbors, Jetties, Ship Terminal Facilities; H07 Highways, Streets, Airfield Paving, Parking Lots; H09 Hospital and Medical Facilities; I01 Industrial Buildings, Manufacturing Plants; I06 Irrigation, Drainage; M08 Modular Systems Design, Pre-fabricated Structures or Components; O01 Office Buildings; P12 Power Generation, Transmission Distribution; R05 Refrigeration Plants/Systems; R06 Rehabilitation (buildings, structures, facilities); S03 Seismic Design and Studies; S04 Sewage Collection, Treatment and Disposal; S05 Soils and Geologic Studies-Foundations; S07 Solid Wastes, Incineration, Landfill; S09 Structural Design; S11 Sustainable Design; S13 Storm Water Handling and Facilities; U03 Utilities; W01 Warehouses and Depots; and W03 Water Supply, Treatment, and Distribution.

Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED, NC rating tool version 2.2 and version 3 (2009).  LEED requirements are provided by MED customers.  MED expects to solicit a wide range of employment specialties to meet its needs, as well as to respond to changing mission requirements.  Preparation of 1391 documents may also be required. The firm may be used to provide engineering experts and consultants. It is anticipated that construction projects being supported by these services will include major military construction, as well as infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction and environmental design actions. The firms must show experience with and may be required to design using MicroStation V8i, Bentley Architecture, Autodesk Revit 2011 or higher; AutoCAD (CAD output may be requested in dwg or dgn format); use Bentley's ProjectWise file management software; and prepare construction cost estimates by computer utilizing Corps of Engineers, TRACES, Microcomputer Aided Cost Estimating Systems/ MII, PACES, PC COST and other related systems.  3.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is a task/delivery order where an exception to fair opportunity requirements was approved due to only one source being available (FAR 8.405-6(b)(1) or 16.505(b)(2)(ii)).<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>The objective of the task is to provide NBCSPG engineering and technical support for the Stryker NBCRV and M93A1 FOX NBCRS. The scope requires the contractor to provide systems engineering expertise to analyze hardware, firmware, and software system concepts. The contractor shall provide engineering support pertaining to software upgrades required due to hardware obsolescence and alternate hardware configurations. The contractor shall provide overall program and project management support as it relates to the successful development and demonstration of the NBCPSG and FOX CPG systems.

<DESC>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED<br />This acquisition will be a new contract for the purchase of Medical Transcription Services. This will be a firm-fixed price contract for a period of two months starting 1 April 2012 through 31 May 2012. The cost for this two month contract will be $115,742.00.<br />III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE<br />AGENCY'S NEEDS<br />Under the contemplated contract, America's Pride will provide Medical Transcription Services at the Eglin AFB Hospital. The contractor shall accurately transcribe common medical terminology. Transcribed reports shall be returned with no errors in spelling, grammar, or punctuation and with no missing words. Reports submitted containing errors shall be returned to the contractor for correction and not included in the line count. Corrected reports shall be delivered no later than the next scheduled duty day. The contractor shall provide medical transcription services for a wide range of medical specialties. The contractor will establish and maintain mechanisms/processes to receive/retrieve/store voice recordings of provider transcriptions. The contractor will insure that all transcriptions are stored and made available in an XML-Enabled format. The contractor will provide review, revision, and electronic signature capabilities from a browser-based application that provides HIPAA compliant access, security, and authentication. The contractor will insure that all transcriptions conform to 96 MDG common templates for transcriptions. Contractor on-site employees will periodically access and download completed transcriptions from contractor server. The contractor is currently transcribing in excess of 63,000 lines and 4500 Radiology reports each month; Total cost for this effort is estimated at $115,742.00. The period of performance of this effort will be from 1 April 2012 to 31 May 2012. Appropriations (Defense Health Program, Operations and Maintenance, Air Force) 0130 will fund this effort.<br />IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN<br />COMPETITION<br />10USC2304(c) l as implemented by FAR 6.302-2 , Unusual and Compelling Urgency
<p><br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)<br />Unusual and compelling urgency 6.302-2: This acquisition requires highly specialized service, requiring knowledge, skills and experience already in place and only available from America's Pride and would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.<br />Medical Transcription Services at the Eglin AFB Hospital is needed to transcribe medical records. The contractor is currently transcribing in excess of 63,000 lines and 4500 Radiology reports each month. The transcription process is very complicated with meeting system technical needs, contract needs and the needs of the Providers. Recent DoD policy restrictions (November 2009) have dictated a change in firewall security measures. These changes have made it very difficult for the hospital to develop a technical solution and a corresponding Performance Work Statement (PWS) which prohibited the acquisition process from moving forward. The 96 Medical Group (MDG) Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT) team has finalized a technical solution that they are confident will meet the needs of the 96 MDG system security, contract, and the 96 MDG Providers. The work required is a logical two month follow on to Contract #FA2823-05-C-0003. The Contractor would handle approximately 189,000 lines of transcription and 13,500 Radiology reports during this 3-month period. Interruption in services would cause serious harm to the Government since approximately 46,000 eligible beneficiaries and over 20 clinics would be affected. A lapse of Medical Transcription Services simply is not an option. Failure to have these services will result in unacceptable mission degradation. Performance in-house by either government civilian or military personnel is not available. Without this service patient care will be jeopardized. The providers will have to complete hand written progress notes, history and physicals, and operative notes. The electronic medical record would be compromised as there would be a lapse in data stored in this record. Utilizing the current contractor has been determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Other options have been considered but the contracting officer does not believe award to anyone other than the incumbent is possible, based on cost effectiveness and continuation of services. Therefore, this acquisition is for continued performance of a highly specialized service.<br />The contractor's specialized capabilities and qualifications that are currently in place and continuing the services thus allowing continuation of the Government's needs. The contractor's personnel are already cleared, trained, and on-site. The equipment is owned and operated by the contractor and would cause undue delay for utilization and adaption of another contractor's equipment, as well as obtaining training and clearances for on-site personnel.<br />AAC/PKO is currently in the process of procuring Transcription Services and an IT Platform. The projected timeline for award was before 1 April 2012. Due to unexpected changes to the Performance Work Statement, the solicitation was posted to FBO on 29 February 2012. The solicitation number is F1T4AS1251A001_MEDICAL_TRANSCRIPTION SERVICES. The government did not intend to receive multiple questions during the solicitation. Since the posting of the solicitation, two amendments have been done on the original solicitation. The most recent amendment was on 23 March 2012. The government intends to award the new contract no later than 1 June 2012. <br />The 96 MDG believes that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force's requirements. It would take another contractor at least three to six months to fully incorporate their equipment and personnel into the new DoD restrictions for security requirements of communications equipment. This would cause transcription and radiology reports to be non-existing in medical records. The 96 MDG SWOT would have to work one-on-one with the new contractor to make them whole, causing a backload of transcription reports. The current contractor is capable of performing the effort due to their early involvement in DoD security requirements. The government was not able to provide the information in time concerning security certifications until just recently. Potential contractors would not have had the technical solution to accomplish the work. The beneficiaries would not have current and up-to-date medical information in their medical records which would cause adverse issues with medical care.<br />Accordingly, America's Pride is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described in Section III above without the U.S. Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements. Services for transcription will continue allowing the beneficiaries to have access to up-to-date medical records.</p>
