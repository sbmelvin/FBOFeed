<DESC><br />The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, located in Honolulu, HI., intends to issue a fixed price purchase order for implementing a workable strategies to establish an on-going multi-species, size-frequency and life history sampling program at the Guam Fishermen's Cooperative Association (GFCA or Coop) location. Having access to continuous harvest and population data is a fundamental requirement in order to be able to assess marine fisheries resources and manage them sustainably. In recognition of expanding data requirements to comply with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (MSRA), the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center is implementing a pilot Commercial Fisheries Bio-Sampling (CFBS) project for the Pacific Islands areas. The long-term goal is to implement and maintain a comprehensive bio-sampling program for Pacific Island areas that will provide biological information needed for stock assessment, including development of Allowable Catch Limit (ACL) guidelines or similar management schemes for key stocks. The CFBS is designed to opportunistically sample existing fisheries and provide in-depth information about the catch, with biological monitoring to include: species identification, size and weight frequencies, age, length, weight and growth data (for the full size range of each species), size at sexual maturity, fecundity and spawning seasonality, and length-frequency data by fishery or gear type. As such, NOAA seeks a contractor that will provide access for CFBS staff to subsample entire catches of non-pelagic species landed at the Coop, provide space for CFBS to conduct biosampling at the Coop and to store biosampling equipment between sampling events, notify CFBS of significant opportunities to sample targeted species and types of catches, allow sufficient time for CFBS staff to identify fish to species, and record length and weight data, and permit CFBS staff to collect samples of body parts used in establishing life history and stock structure parameters from a subset of the catch, including but not limited to gonads, otoliths, stomachs, portions of the fin, tissue samples, and in some cases entire animals for archive. The anticipated performance period is date of award through September 14, 2011. To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide service. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for which you have furnished this service previously. Information should provide sufficient detail that demonstrates the firm's knowledge and ability to perform the requirement. This support service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items Procedures as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This is a simplified acquisition estimated value not to exceed $100,000.00. Interested parties can obtain a copy of the Request for Quotation from this site.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, located in Honolulu, HI., intends to issue a fixed price purchase order for the use of an NRC-licensed radioisotope laboratory that is: 1) experienced in conducting lead-radium or related uranium-series dating; and 2) capable of incorporating a NOAA procured alpha-spectrometer analysis system into the laboratory arrangement. The radioisotope facility would need to include a clean-room laboratory for conducting the separation, purification, and analyses of sample specific radioisotopes required for lead-radium dating. The contract would provide a NOAA scientist (Dr. Allen Andrews), experienced in the application of lead-radium dating of fish otoliths, use of the facility to conduct lead-radium dating research on otoliths of priority within the "Deep-7" bottomfish species. The work undertaken by Dr. Andrews for this research would be in a manner that abides by the operational protocols and practices of the laboratory and with the cooperation and approval of the director and lab manager of the NRC-licensed radioisotope laboratory. For the purposes of this contract, only NRC-licensed radioisotope laboratory facilities located on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii will be considered because of various logistical reasons associated with having to be in close proximity to the facility. NOAA, Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) is responsible for developing stock assessments that provide the information needed by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council to evaluate the status of any fishery, and if necessary, develop and implement management measures to ensure the future sustainable of that fishery. Current stock assessment efforts within the PIFSC Fish Biology &amp; Stock Assessment Division (FBSAD) have focused on the bottomfish fishery that harvests deep-slope species of snappers, jacks, and grouper within the Hawaiian Archipelago. With the recent closure of the bottomfish fishery in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, stock assessments are now being developed to ascertain the status of the bottomfish fishery within the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). Of primary concern are the status of the MHI "Deep-7" species that consist of six eteline snappers and one endemic grouper species. While stock assessments are currently being developed to evaluate the status of these resources, gaps in important biological information of direct relevance to these assessment efforts continue to persist. One of the most basic and critical biological parameters is the determination of accurate length-at-age relationships for the "Deep-7" species including the determination of a valid age and growth parameters, including longevity, for these species. Current length-at-age relationships and longevity estimates for these species were produced in the 1980s and 1990s based on the processing of otoliths (fish ear bones located within the brain cavity) for micro-increment (daily) enumeration and the application of numerical integration techniques to estimate total age. These past results need to be re-evaluated in light of the more recent use of annuli (yearly growth marks) found within sectioned otoliths. More recently, the application of lead-radium dating to age otoliths provided an estimate of age independent of micro-increment or annuli counts. This method can provide a form of validation for growth mark age estimates and can provide a determination of age when no counting method was reliable. Lead-radium dating relies on the incorporation of radium-226 (226Ra), a naturally occurring calcium analog, from the environment into the otolith and its subsequent decay to lead-210 (210Pb). By measuring the disequilibria of these two radioisotopes in otolith material, an independent estimate of age can be determined based on the known in-growth rate of 210Pb from 226Ra. This technique requires the removal of otolith core material (usually the first 1-2 years of otolith deposition) to measure 226Ra and 210Pb. Pooling of core material from otoliths of similar sized fish is typically required due to low levels of 226Ra present in most otolith cores. The separation and purification of otolith cores in preparation for analyses of 226Ra and 210Pb require the use of radioisotope tracers in a geochemical clean room that is licensed through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Furthermore, analysis of the 210Pb activity in the otolith sample requires a specialized low-level radioactive detector system, technically referred to as an alpha-spectrometer system. If no qualified responses are received, the Government intends to contract with The University of Hawaii, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) Isotope Laboratory. The anticipated performance period is date of award through September 14, 2011. To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide service.

<DESC>Special Notice: The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), National Reconditioning Center (NRC) is awarding a Purchase Order for the repair services of the following equipment: 5 each COIL, FOCUS TUB ASSEMBLY, OGALLALA PN: 41C2081, PREMIER GA1587L, ASN: R400-3L1A1 to Magnetic Technologies Corp. Sole Source Justification: The Government only knows of one responsible source, Magnetic Technologies, who has the facilities, procedures and expertise to assure the successful and timely repair of the equipment. Market research is the following: Multiple searches of the Small Business Administration (SBA) Dynamic Small Search did not identify any small business available to compete for this required repair service. Search parameters included a combination of NAICS codes and key words: &lsquo;334411, 332999, repair, focus coil' and just key words: &lsquo;repair, focus coil'. A search of "Repair focus coil" in GSA's eLibrary returned "23V Automotive Superstore - Category 271 108: Spare Components and Equipment for Sedans, Light, Buses, Medium and Heavy Duty Trucks Including Filters, Belts, Hoses, Pads, Pumps, Blades, Shocks, and Bulbs". This category has nothing to do with radar klystrons and focus coils, but has ignition or distributor coils somewhere in the category. This is a false match. A sources sought was posted on FedBizOpps on July 1, 2010 for a 5 day posting and no responses were received.

1)	Please define what is required for the "SIC" in the certifications area? 	The Standard Industrial Classification Codes that appear in a company's disseminated EDGAR filings indicate the company's type of business.

For example: '7000' is a SIC for HOTELS, ROOMING HOUSES, CAMPS & OTHER LODGING PLACES.
		
2)	Please clarify more on the SBA and subcontracting portion of this solicitation.  	If no subcontracting opportunities are available, please provide your subcontracting plan to reflect that subcontracting opportunities are not available and provide response to reflect the barriers that restrict your ability to subcontract.   
		
3)	May I also have a copy of the 1449 form to make my submission?	Yes, attached
		
4)	Please verify that only the hotels in cities requested at this time need to submit a proposal in the format requested to be included in this BPA?

Anyone (sole proprietors, corporations, partnerships and governmental organizations) desiring to do business with the federal government must register in CCR. However, CCR registration is not required for individuals seeking grants.  By registering in CCR, you gain the ability to bid on federal government contracts. Your CCR registration does not guarantee your winning a government contract or increasing your level of business. Registration is simply a prerequisite before bidding on a contract. 
ORCA (https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx)
You must be registered in ORCA if the solicitation you are responding to requires that you have an active registration in CCR.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is the primary vendor database for the U.S. Federal Government. Since October 1, 2003, it is federally mandated that any business wishing to do business with the federal government under a FAR-based contract must be registered in CCR before being awarded a contract. In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually.  Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) replaces most of the paper based Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) in Section K of solicitations with an Internet application. FAR 52.204-8 mandates the use of ORCA on or after January 1, 2005.  CCR and ORCA are complementary systems. ORCA reuses data pulled from CCR and pre-populates many of the required Representations and Certifications. Then, the vendor completes the remaining Reps and Certs with the understanding that with each solicitation they are certifying to current, accurate and complete information.  You need to update ORCA at least once a year. You can update or change your Reps and Certs information whenever necessary and the 365 day clock will start over from the day of change.<BR><BR>

Maintenance, service and repair of government owned specialized marine instrumentation and equipment used for benthic habitat mapping, ecological monitoring, ecosystem investigations, oceanographic studies, and fisheries research. This is 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. Background: The NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center utilizes complex marine instrumentation and equipment which is deployed on ocean-going and near-shore vessels operating in the U.S. Pacific Islands and Atolls and their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). Specialized instrumentation and equipment are used for benthic habitat mapping, ecological monitoring, ecosystem investigations, oceanographic studies, and fisheries research. Servicing, maintenance, modification, and repair of such equipment is often required prior to, during, and immediately after research cruises, which last up to 70 days at sea and are conducted throughout the year. Although the types of instrumentation and equipment are known, the nature of the required servicing, repair, modifications, etc. cannot be determined at this time as it is dependant on the conditions and events that the gear are subject to during the cruise and also dependant on the needs/mission of particular cruises, some of which are not determined at this time. Consequently, it is not possible at the time of establishing the contract to accurately estimate the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of certainty. This situation is common for the maintenance and servicing of complex marine equipment. Quotations are being requested, and the entire solicitation is attached. No Further solicitation will be issued. All questions must be submitted in writing to Bonnie.Oshiro@noaa.gov. The North American Industry Classification System code is 488390.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), located in Honolulu, HI., in recognition of expanding data requirements for meeting the responsibilities of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006, is looking for a contractor to implement a pilot Commercial Fisheries Bio-Sampling (CFBS) Project for the Pacific Islands area of Guam utilizeing and enhancing the local capacity in these areas in order to help ensure the success and longevity of the project. The ultimate goals of the CFBS Project are to improve life history information needed for stock assessment and address the data requirements for developing new annual catch limit (ACL) guidelines and similar management schemes for key stocks. The initial species focus of the CFBS Project will be on the shallow bottomfish and reef fish complexes. Selection of priority species for life history investigation will take into consideration the "Risk Ranked Species" list established by the Western Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Council (WPRFMC) and the availability of specimens over a range of sizes and seasons. Beginning in the Fall 2009, the CFBS Project on Guam was initiated with the hiring of a biological assistant to conduct market sampling of shallow bottomfish and reef fish species. This current bio-sampling effort provides biological information that establishes accurate identifications of market sold species and size composition (length and weight) data of marketed catch. Current market sampling efforts through the Guam Fishermen's Coop also includes the collection of otoliths, gonads, and fin clips for future life history studies of age &amp; growth, size at reproductive maturity, and DNA-based validation of species identifications, respectively. This contract is specifically to fund life history research to determine age &amp; growth and longevity of one priority species for which a sufficient sample size of otoliths have become available through the CFBS Project on Guam. For the purposes of this contract, only the Island of Guam will be included in the scope of this study. The Contractor will collaborate with the CFBS Project staff on Guam and the PIFSC Life History Program to evaluate the available otolith specimen collections obtained through bio-sampling at the Guam Fishermen's Coop and possibly other fish markets on Guam. Selection of the one species for age &amp; growth study will be based on an evaluation of the following four factors: 1) demersal fish species or species taxon considered at risk of overfishing, 2) a sufficient otolith sample size (n&gt;80 individuals, n=40 per gender) is or will be available, 3) otoliths available from a representative size distribution of the species, and 4) confirmation that visible growth marks appear internally within prepared (sectioned or ground) otoliths. The Contractor will assist the CFBS Project staff on Guam to opportunistically obtain otoliths from rarely encountered small and large size individuals when they appear in the markets on Guam. To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide service. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for which you have furnished this service previously. Information should provide sufficient detail that demonstrates the firm's knowledge and ability to perform the requirement. This support service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items Procedures as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.

<DESC>Questions and Answers
<p>1) Will the successful bidder be allowed to create a temporary enlarged access into building 7651?</p>
<p>Response: No.</p>
<p>2) Does the "wide body fuselage" have to be an "A300 series" aircraft or can a B-767 or other wide body aircraft type be substituted?</p>
<p>Response: Yes, it does have to be an A300 series.</p>
<p>3) Are the lower fuselage cargo holds required as part of the "aircraft fuselage"?</p>
<p>Response: No.</p>
<p>4) Is the fuselage required to be mounted at aircraft height above the facility floor?</p>
<p>Response: No.</p>
<p>5) What, if any is the required functionality for the aircraft doors? Are the aircraft doors (both passenger and cargo types) required to be installed in the fuselage?<br /><br />Response: The passenger doors should be functional to open and close and use as entrances. Cargo doors not needed.</p>
<p>6) How will personnel enter and exit from the trainer?</p>
<p>Response: Through aircraft doors.</p>
<p>7) What existing "aircraft lighting" other than the main cabin lights (i.e. galley lights, reading lights, work lights, emergency lights, exit lights, lavatory lights, etc.) will be required to be functional?</p>
<p>Response: No additional lighting needed than stated on question.</p>
<p>8) Is the main cabin lighting required to operate from any controls other than the aircraft flight attendant panels?</p>
<p>Response: No.</p>
<p>9) Are any other features of the aircraft fuselage required to function in addition to the "existing lighting"?</p>
<p>Response: No.</p>
<p>10) Is the Air Force aware that 400 Hz 3 phase power will be required to operate the "existing lighting" consisting of "authentic aircraft parts" in the aircraft fuselage?</p>
<p>Response: Yes.</p>
<p>11) What is the level of fidelity is required in the cockpit area?</p>
<p>Response: Cockpit should have authentic aircraft non working instrument panels and parts.</p>
<p>12) Will the fuselage require a smoke and heat detection system? If so, will this system be required to interface with the existing facility fire detection system?</p>
<p>Response: No.</p>
<p>13) Will the fuselage require a functioning ventilation system? If so, will this system be required to interface with the existing facility HVAC system?</p>
<p>Response: Yes. Flexible air conditioner ducts will interface with the exiting HVAC system.</p>
<p>14) Can a "simulated" A300 fiberglass and metal fuselage structure, with a salvage aircraft interior be used rather than an actual aircraft?</p>
<p>Response: Yes. All interior should be authentic aircraft parts from an A300 aircraft.</p>
<p><br /><br />Note: No further questions will be accepted.</p>

Anyone (sole proprietors, corporations, partnerships and governmental organizations) desiring to do business with the federal government must register in CCR. However, CCR registration is not required for individuals seeking grants.  By registering in CCR, you gain the ability to bid on federal government contracts. Your CCR registration does not guarantee your winning a government contract or increasing your level of business. Registration is simply a prerequisite before bidding on a contract. 
ORCA (https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx)
You must be registered in ORCA if the solicitation you are responding to requires that you have an active registration in CCR.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is the primary vendor database for the U.S. Federal Government. Since October 1, 2003, it is federally mandated that any business wishing to do business with the federal government under a FAR-based contract must be registered in CCR before being awarded a contract. In addition, vendors must maintain their CCR records annually.  Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) replaces most of the paper based Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) in Section K of solicitations with an Internet application. FAR 52.204-8 mandates the use of ORCA on or after January 1, 2005.  CCR and ORCA are complementary systems. ORCA reuses data pulled from CCR and pre-populates many of the required Representations and Certifications. Then, the vendor completes the remaining Reps and Certs with the understanding that with each solicitation they are certifying to current, accurate and complete information.  You need to update ORCA at least once a year. You can update or change your Reps and Certs information whenever necessary and the 365 day clock will start over from the day of change.<BR><BR>
