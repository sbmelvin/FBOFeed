<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
Solicitation AG-52KY-S-07-0001 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15.  

The Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Indiana State Office intends to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) to small business sources capable of providing real estate appraisals throughout the state of Indiana for a period of approximately two years.  A BPA does not obligate the Government to order or the vendor to furnish any articles of any quantity except to the extent that may be agreed upon in connection with individual transactions.  Obligation is made at the time of an actual order.  Current BPA holders issued by this office need not respond to this announcement.  

Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser or obtain a temporary practice permit in Indiana and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued.  Occasionally appraisals are required for property which is within two adjoining states.  The appraiser will need to provide, at a minimum, a temporary practice permit for both states before performing any appraisal on that property.  

Appraisers must demonstrate competency in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) in conducting appraisals of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.  All appraisals completed for this program shall comply with USPAP, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA aka Yellow Book) and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.  Documentation of appraisal education courses attended such as eminent domain or conservation easements and UASFLA courses shall be provided by the Appraiser to the Contracting Officer.  

USDA NRCS is also seeking sources capable of providing technical appraisal reviews of appraisals done by other vendors within the state of Indiana.  Review Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued.  The review appraiser must have demonstrated competency in compliance with USPAP in conducting appraisal reviews of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.

A narrative of the offeror's technical capability to meet the government's requirements and a resume listing the personal qualifications of the individuals who will be doing the work. In addition, provide documentation of appraisal education courses attended such as eminent domain or conservation easements and UASFLA course and at least 40 hours of training in conducting technical reviews if interested in performing review type work.   

(2) Past Performance. This may include descriptions of other similar work or related projects performed or currently being performed and a review of references provided.  

Competition among BPA holders will be done prior to ordering individual appraisals and reviews as necessary.  

The clause at FAR 52.212-4 applies to this acquisition. The clause at FAR 52.212-5 applies (attached).  Additional terms and conditions may be contained in the draft BPA as attached.       

For planning purposes there are approximately 50 appraisals to be done before September 30, 2007.  History for the last four years is as follows:  FY 2003 ? 60 appraisals; FY 2004 ? 87 appraisals; FY 2005 ? 91 appraisals; and, FY 2006 - 43.   Changes in policy now require that two appraisals be done on each property.  The first appraisal will be done at market value (before value).  The second appraisal will be done of the subject property with the proposed easement placed on it (after value).  Technical or administrative review will be done on 100% of all appraisals completed.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented by additional information included in this notice. Solicitation number DTRT57-07-R-20013 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This solicitation is conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15.  The NAICS code is 518210 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a proposal is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  The authority permitting contracting without providing for full and open competition is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) intends to award a firm fixed price contract to Weather Services International (WSI) Corporation of Andover, Massachusetts on a non-competitive basis to acquire radar mosaic weather data services and the necessary distribution licenses to support the production of weather information for the Federal Aviation Administration?s (FAA) Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS). The proposed contract shall commence on February 1, 2007 for a period of performance of up to 4 years and 10 months, consisting of a 10-month base period with 4, 1-year option periods. The Volpe Center requires real-time weather data for the processing, display, and distribution of weather data to designated users via ETMS, as supported by the Volpe Center?s Traffic Flow Management Division. ETMS is an operational FAA system by which the FAA monitors and controls real-time air traffic. A major component of ETMS is its weather overlay and background processing functions that require access to operational weather data. The Contractor shall provide a continuous transmission of the real-time weather data required by ETMS to a central receiving site and a backup receiving site for processing and/or redistribution. Real-time data refers to an immediate report of the weather data allowing only for minor processing and communication delays. The Government shall reserve the right to process the data via ETMS for incorporation into products for Government use and distribution only. It may also be necessary to archive the data within ETMS, and store the data for a limited time at receiving sites to satisfy requirements for accident investigations and product development. The ETMS central receiving site shall be the Volpe Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, or another facility designated by the Volpe Center. The backup receiving site (also known as the ETMS Disaster Recovery Hubsite) shall be the FAA?s William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) at the Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey. The Contractor must possess an operational weather data capacity that will meet the weather data delivery requirements identified herein. The Contractor shall also provide the necessary licenses for direct or indirect data distribution, as designated by the Volpe Center.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Pursuant to the requirements of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-3(b) the justification for soliciting from a single source is supported by the following facts and rationale:

1. NOAA MOA-RB has a brand-name requirement for the overhaul of two (2) Caterpillar 3500 Series Diesel Engines located aboard the NOAA Ship RONALD H. BROWN.  Caterpillar is the original equipment manufacturer of the engine; the parts required to overhaul this engine are not interchangeable with other brands of engines.  The procedures to be employed to successfully accomplish the overhaul must be in accordance with Caterpillar service, maintenance and overhaul technical manuals, including service bulletins to ensure that the manufacturer's warranty is not compromised.

2. The synopsis and solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps with the intent to solicit quotes only from authorized Caterpillar repair facilities with unique capabilities to satisfy NOAA's requirement. Quotes will be solicited only from Caterpillar dealers as they are the only vendors that are able to provide Caterpillar parts and warranty.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) is planning the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the acquisition of three spare parts as follows: Monitor, Radio Frequency, NSN 5950-01-089-3567, Govt P/N S M-C-803069-1, [M/A-COM Inc. P/N MPS620A]; Microwave Circuit, NSN 5840-01-072-0422, Govt P/N 361549-011, [M/A-COM Inc. P/N MPS682]; Interconnecting Box, NSN 5975-01-072-4464, Govt P/N 390548, [M/A-COM Inc. P/N ODMPS681].  The resultant contract will be a five year Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract that will fulfill the Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 thru FY 2011 new hardware fabrication and depot level repair services for each spare part.  The estimated quantity re quired for new hardware fabrication is 270 each for the Monitor, Radio Frequency, 170 each for the Microwave Circuit, and 170 each for the Interconnecting Box.  Further, it is estimated that for each spare part a quantity of 12 each will be repaired each y ear.  All three spares are part of the Firefinder radar system, AN/TPQ-36/37.  They function as critical devices in the operation shelter.  The Firefinder Radar System is a mobile, phased array radar system that automatically locates hostile mortar and art illery projectiles.  The system is composed of an operations control group or shelter, an antenna transceiver group and power group.  The AN/TPQ-36/37 Radar System provides force protection.  It is anticipated that the release of the solicitation will be i n January 2007, with a proposal due approximately 30 days later.  Acquisition strategy is as follows:  (1) Sole Source negotiation with M/A-COM Inc.,1011 Pawtucket Blvd., Lowell, MA 01854-1040, (CAGE:  96341); (2) award will be made on a fair and reasonabl e basis; (3) Contract will be as a 5-year FFP IDIQ for FY07 thru FY11 requirements.  Contract award is projected for May 2007.  M/A-COM Inc. is currently an approved producer of these items, thus First Article Testing or Qualification Testing is not requir ed prior to Government acceptance of product.  The Government possesses only Source Control Drawings for these items.  These drawings do not contain enough technical data (electrical parameters, parts list, schematic and test procedures) defining the items .  M/A-COM Inc. is the only source capable of meeting the Governments requirements, because it is the only source that possesses the technical data for production or repair.  Further, this data is proprietary to M/A-COM Inc.  Delivery of these items will be Freight On Board (FOB) Destination to New Cumberland Army Depot, W25G1U, DDSP New Cumberland Facility, Transportation Officer, Bldg 2001, Mission Door 113-134, New Cumberland, PA  17070-5001.

Note: This link leads to a solicitation-specific login page intended for Vendor accounts only. You will not be able to log in to view your data as a Vendor by using this link. 
The USSOCOM is requesting information from appropriate companies or parties currently developing manned/unmanned platforms on a) the capabilities of their platforms and b) the production capabilities of their facilities.  During the initial information gathering of this ISR RFI, request companies planning to provide a capability response identify, to the USSOCOM point of contact (POC) named below, the name of your company, address, telephone number, and name and position in the company of the individual to contact for future dialog.  Broad industry participation is desired but USSOCOM is keenly interested in designs that are currently in production or capable of rapidly entering into production (delivery of a capability within one year would be highly desired).  Details and requirements can be found on FedTeDs https://www.fedteds.gov/ under PR H92222-07-R-0008.

2.  This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request For Proposal (RFP), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  No responses received will be used as a proposal.

3.  Further USSOCOM interest will be dependent on the results of the RFI capability assessment (including mission performance assessments) and USSOCOM operational requirements analyses and determinations. Potentially, future leasing or purchasing agreements may be sought to obtain platforms in order to temporarily or permanently modify them with mission and/or instrumentation equipment for more extensive evaluation. 

4.  Submissions are requested COB Monday, 22 Jan 07 and may be made by e-mail or mailing your response (response on any common computer media format) to the PCO, Kim DeBois Sousa at  deboisk@socom.mil .

5.  This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the ?art of the possible? from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future     strategies for the possible uses of platforms within the military.  Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such.  Any company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked.   Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any     unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.

6.  U.S. and non-U.S. firms are permitted to respond to this RFI.  Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and provided equally to all interested parties unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a Company or that Company?s response.     Currently, one-on-one information gathering sessions with respondents are not contemplated.  If one-on-one sessions with interested parties are conducted, they will be offered to all to clarify understanding of the submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss the form of agreement to cover any flight demonstrations.  Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after all qualitative assessments are completed.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to award an extension to the Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract N00039-05-C-0013 to Northrop Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS), 12011 Sunset Hills Road, Reston, VA. from 31 January 2007 through 30 September 2008 (or until Full Rate Production approval for Increment 4.1, whichever occurs sooner).  NGMS will provide the following services up to a Security Level of Top Secret within the Continental United States: 1) Software maintenance and life cycle support (including test support and integration) for the Global Command and Control System â€“ Maritime (GCCS-M) Increment 4.0 and its Common Operating Environment (COE) products through January 2008. Software maintenance includes integration of software upgrades, updates, and preparation of associated documentation; 2) Software development of Increment 4.1 leading to successful completion of Acquisition Milestone Decisions to include Milestone C Approval (MS-C), planned in the 2nd quarter of  2007, Operational Test (OT) of Increment 4.1 in June 2008, and Full Rate Production (FRP) in September 2008.  Past experience has identified that deficiencies recognized during OT will need to be corrected as a condition for full fielding approval.  As the prime developer and integrator of the GCCS-M and the COE products evaluated in the OT, award of a development contract to an alternate vendor would result in an estimated schedule burden of up to one year in the full fielding of Increment 4.1; and 3) Activities performed shall also include reworking the current version of the Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) GCCS-M Increment 4.1 software to permit Government evaluation of reuse potential for Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC) per the Net-Centric Enterprise Solutions for Interoperability (NESI) guidance, to include participation in pilots and exercises; this effort will not include development of additional functionality. Additionally, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, will be conducted for a competitive contract to run concurrent with the extension of N00039-05-C- 0013. The competitive contract anticipated award date is in FY2007 on or around 3rd quarter 2007.  The scope of this competitive contract will include Navy GCCS Family of Systems (FoS) and Navy NECC architecture and design support of all GCCS-M Software Increments post 4.1 FRP, including software development, software and hardware integration, training and life-cycle support, testing, hardware procurement, and installation planning. It will also include training, maintenance and life cycle support, and installation support of all GCCS-M increments. While the Government welcomes responses and questions, the intent of this notice is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete the extension of N00039-05-C-0013 based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. Questions concerning this sole source contract may be directed to mary.ohara@navy.mil or cheryl.fisher@navy.mil.

The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on past performance, key personnel capability and experience, and price.

Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Business Planning Technical Assistance.  

The following clarification is made to the December 22, 2006 announcement, reference USTDA number 0611009B-1, which is a reposting (without change) of USTDA number 0611009B.  

The grantee, Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, has determined that all of the proposals submitted in response to the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Business Planning Technical Assistance Request for Proposal (USTDA number 0611009B/deadline date September 28, 2006), lacked sufficient experience in the broadcasting field, including regional and business qualifications, and so were not fully responsive to the award criteria.

1.0 Description.  Broadband COMSATCOM service alternatives for the VIP/SAM air fleet.

2.0 Background.  DoD currently leverages COMSATCOM service to provide narrowband and broadband communications service to the VIP/SAM air fleet.  Wideband service is currently provided through a combination of Inmarsat Swift64 service and Connexions by Boeing (CbB) managed service.  

DoD is investigating alternative solutions to provide continuing and expanded broadband COMSATCOM service to the VIP/SAM air fleet.  The solutions must address the following requirements/constraints:

a) Support a current VIP/SAM air fleet of 6 simultaneous aircraft worldwide with a desire for the number of simultaneous aircraft to increase
b) For any near-term solutions (prior to 2009), no modifications to the airframes are possible while only form, fit, and function modifications internal to the aircraft should be considered
c) Systems must meet Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight safety standards for usage upon commercial aircraft
d) Utilize low-profile / conformal antennas acceptable to the commercial airline industry
e) Provide world-wide northern hemisphere coverage of the major air routes as a minimum with the objective of full world-wide mid-latitude (between 60o N and 60o S latitude) coverage
f) Provide a proven high system availability rate
g) Support for 20+ simultaneous users with throughputs capable of supporting:
(1)Real-time, two-way, high speed internet access
(2)Government Intranet access
(3)E-mail
(4)Virtual Private Networking (VPN)
(5)Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
(6)Fax over Internet Protocol (FoIP)
(7)Video Teleconferencing (VTC)

3.3.1.3 Business type (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business) based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 517410, Satellite Telecommunications.  ?Small business concern? means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR Part 121. A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, averaging no more than $13.5 million dollars in annual receipts.  Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for 3 or more complete fiscal years means the annual average gross revenue of the concern taken for the last 3 fiscal years.  Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for less than 3 complete fiscal years means its total receipts for the period it has been in business, divided by the number of weeks including fractions of a week that it has been in business, and multiplied by 52.  Respondents are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only.  Additional standards and conditions apply. Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19 for additional detailed information on Small Business Size Standards.

The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 SMART servers, along with these other components have been identified as key component of the Department’s SMART server infrastructure.   IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified and classified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.   As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed.  Furthermore, these setups are matched to specific configuration needs in the DoS that recur on a regular basis making them virtually interchangeable and simplifying our spare part logistic needs. Finally, standardization preserves our ability to more easily expand with newer server models from the same manufacturer and achieve economies of scale, particularly in test and development environments, with lower overall cost.<BR><BR>The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 Servers, Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 Servers, and related infrastructure equipment described in paragraph (2) have been identified as key components of the Department’s SMART server infrastructure which will provide Command and Control message handling, collaboration, Archive and Records Management functions for the Department of State. The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 servers have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and are approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.    Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.After extensive testing, the HP servers were the only servers found to be compatible with the Departments existing hardware and software.<BR><BR>

The building houses the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Postal Service.  Originally constructed as a Post Office and Courthouse in 1892, the building was enlarged in 1933.  The earlier, four-story (plus attic) structure that occupies the southern end of the site was designed by Mifflin Bell, then Supervising Architect of the Treasury, and is Romanesque Revival in style.  The exterior facades are built of granite-faced masonry, embellished with carved ornament, dormers and turrets.  The eight-story 1933 addition that occupies the balance of the site was undertaken under the direction of James Wetmore, Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury.  In designing the addition, great effort was made to emulate the appearance of the 1892 structure.  While many architectural details are shared by both structures, the 1933 structure incorporated the use of terra cotta cladding, in lieu of granite, above the first floor.  Above this level, the use of granite was limited to the stonework surrounding the second floor windows.

This project will involve the replacement of nearly all the deteriorated terra cotta cladding on the facades of the 1933 structure with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials, restoration of all existing granite cladding on both buildings, and replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system on both structures.   The entire complex will remain fully occupied throughout the construction period.  The design will follow the Secretary of Interior?s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Historic Building Preservation Plan (HBPP) guidance, respecting the historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements to correct the deficiencies in the exterior envelope of the building and to preclude further fa?ade deterioration and damage to the structure and the recently renovated historic interior. The delivery method for this project will be Construction Manager as constructor (CMc). The Government anticipates selecting up to three (3) CMcs to provide pre-construction services. During the Design Phase of this project, the selected CMc firms will work with GSA, the A-E firm and the Construction Manager as agent (CMa), and will provide design phase consultations and recommendations on scheduling, cost impacts, alternative design implications, building systems, construction materials and constructability.  At the conclusion of the Design Phase, one (1) of the CMcs will be selected to serve as the General Contractor providing the required construction services.  The selected CMc will serve as the single point of responsibility during construction.  

Companies who have the necessary construction experience, as well as an interest in this project, should submit a statement of capabilities, which is not a proposal, but rather a short statement regarding the firm?s expertise and experience on projects similar in scope to the one described in this notice.  Your response should also include the firm?s capability of obtaining bonds for a project with a magnitude between $45,000,000 to $55,000,000. Firms should indicate eligibility for SBA programs and whether they are certified as HUBZone small business concerns and/or small disadvantaged business concerns under the ?8(a)? program in addition to service disabled veteran owned small businesses and other small business concerns.

Responses to this market survey should be submitted no later than 2:00 pm (Eastern Time) on January 23, 2007.  Please email your response to francis.cashman@gsa.gov or mail your response to the General Services Administration, PBS Project Management Division, 2PCB, Attention: Mr. Frank Cashman, Room 1639, New York, NY 10278.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), on behalf of the National Institute of National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), , is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small business organizations interested in this requirement.  This acquisition may be solicited as full and open or as small business set-aside including 8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veterans as defined by the Small Business Act.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Small Business sources are sought that possess the capability to provide support services described below for the NCRR.  The new contract is anticipated to be awarded on September 30, 2007 for a period of five years. 

As part of the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research process to Reengineer the Clinical Research Enterprise, NIH issued an RFA for institutional Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA).  The purpose of the CTSA initiative, which is a joint NCRR and NIH Roadmap activity, is to assist institutions to forge a uniquely transformative, novel, and integrative academic home for Clinical and Translational Science.  These new Clinical and Translational Science entities are expected to serve as a magnet that concentrates basic, translational, and clinical investigators, community clinicians, clinical practices, networks, professional societies, and industry to facilitate the development of new professional interactions, programs, and research projects. It is anticipated that these new institutional arrangements, coupled with innovative advanced degree programs, will foster the development of a new discipline of Clinical and Translational Science that will be both broader and more pervasive than the classical and separate domains of translational research and clinical investigation.  When fully implemented in 2012, about 60 CTSA programs will be supported.

As part of this cooperative initiative, CTSA awardees will participate in trans-CTSA Steering Committees in areas of broad interest to discuss and address national issues through sharing and cooperation.  Although NIH anticipates that awardees will differ in their internal structures and emphasis, informatics, human protection, training, and clinical service are envisioned to be areas of shared interest with national level Steering Committees for each area.  Project management and technical support of these Steering Committees in their cooperative activities will be necessary for accomplishment of shared projects.
The purpose of this acquisition is to seek small business organizations capable of providing project management and technical support for the institutional CTSA program.  The Contractor shall provide technical support to the NCRR Division of Clinical Research for CTSA activities where the current staffing and research management resources are limited.  Contractor activities shall include: 1) project management/executive secretary staffing for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working groups; 2) establish, maintain, and manage a web based password protected collaborative workspace for above groups; 3) establish, maintain, and manage a public CTSA web site for dissemination of activities and products; 4) logistics and meeting support services for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working Group meetings; 5) provision of qualified subcontracted or consultant technical expertise in a timely fashion; 6) administrative management and oversight for the review process of informatics pilot projects; and 7) provision of contract closeout and orderly transition.  

Interested firms that are classified under NAICS code 541710 should furnish capability information addressing the following:  

(a)	the experience of the organization in performing other similar contract programs

(b)	ability to prepare Annual Performance and Operating Plans 

(c)	the ability of the organization to effectively and quickly obtain and manage subcontracts, for highly specialized technical services not performed in-house, and maintain complete and effective labor, technical, and management control of the program

(d)	the ability of the organization to provide high level project management staffing  for CTSA Steering Committees, NIH CTSA Subcommittees, and Working Groups; the personnel must provide careful attention to detail, organizational skill, excellent oral and written skills, ability to work independently, and working knowledge of a variety of technical areas related to clinical and translational research

(e)	the ability of the organization to provide appropriate project management and planning processes, including staffing, scheduling, reporting, and cost control; ability and experience of the organization to effectively transition at the start and end of similar contracts and to adapt quickly to different workload levels over time

(f)	experience and competence in managing the independent review and evaluation of scientific and technical proposals in a timely fashion, including the provision of evaluation reports

(g)	the ability of the organization to develop and revise technical documents, in the most efficient and cost-effective manner

(h)	the ability of the organization to provide IT support services, including programming, website development and hosting and database development; the ability to provide password protected web based collaborative work space for collaborative groups with appropriate attention to IT security issues.

(i)	the ability of the organization to arrange and support professional meetings in the most efficient and cost-effective manner, including consideration of travel and other meeting-related tasks and expenses; ability to provide access to and management of various mechanisms for virtual meetings, including but not limited to, telephone and video conferencing

(j)	the ability of the organization to meet with NCRR staff at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland with as little as two hours advance notice


This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and none is available.  An original and two copies of the capability statement should be submitted to:

3.  SUPERVISION:

Specific assignments frequently originate out of the liaison activities of the work, and the  incumbent independently negotiates the scope and objectives of projects with little input or review by his/her supervisor.  Since the incumbent is physically located in Bangkok, he/she will exercise considerable independent judgment in developing new and improved approaches in analyzing and reviewing INL?s programs in the region for which he/she has responsibility.

4. SUPERVISION EXERCISED:

The incumbent has responsibility for supervising a non-Direct Hire multi-disciplined staff (Budget Analyst, Program Analyst and Auditors) in the performance of accounting and auditing activities relating to international counternarcotics and anticrime programs throughout the 28 countries for which he/she is responsible.

Other laws, including other authorities under the FAA, several Narcotics Control Acts, the Narcotics Control Trade Act, the Arms Export Control Act, provisions of DOD authorization acts, provisions of the annual Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Program Appropriations Act (which appropriates funds for the INL programs), other supplemental appropriation laws, and the State Department Basic Authorities Act, also contain provisions relevant to the programs for which INL has responsibility.  In addition, broad agency policy statements for the program may include reference to pertinent legislative history.  The Senior Financial Management Advisor must exercise considerable judgment in interpreting and adapting existing precedents and in developing new or improved approaches in analyzing controversial and nationally important subjects to persons with conflicting views.  The incumbent is recognized as an expert in the development and/or interpretation of guidance on financial and organizational management issues.

6.  COMPLEXITY:

The work involves planning, organizing, and completing financial and organizational analysis of enormous complexity.  Frequently due to the high visibility and political sensitivity related to the issues with which the Bureau deals, there is extreme difficulty in identifying the nature of the issues or problems and in planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of studies/audits to be undertaken.  Difficulty is also encountered in separating the substantive nature of programs or issues into their components and determining the nature and magnitude of programs or issues.  Also, in discerning the intent of legislation and policy statements and determining how to translate the intent into program actions. 

7. SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS:

The Senior Financial Management Advisor performs very broad and extensive assignments related to a complex administrative/financial program, in excess of $1 Billion, spanning the full range of counternarcotics, anticrime, and civilian policing programs throughout the region serviced by the Bangkok Financial Center, which is of significant interest to the public and to the Congress.  The INL programs have a significant impact on the domestic and overseas operations of this, as well as other agencies.  The incumbent will be required to travel to and work in hazardous duties areas, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, on a frequent basis.

8.  PERSONAL CONTACTS:

The incumbent works closely with the senior management team of the INL Bureau, and with senior managers in other Bureaus, other agencies, and at the overseas posts for which he/she has regional responsibility.  He/she may also have dealings with principal and senior management representatives from private sector firms with existing or pending contractual relationships with the Department, as well as Congressional staffs.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking to identify small businesses (SDB, WOB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB) particularly General Services Administration contract holders with capabilities or prior experience for potential award of a contract to conduct activities required by the Medicaid Integrity Program provisions in the Deficit Reduction Act. The overall activities include the review of the actions of individuals or entities furnishing items or services under a Medicaid state plan; the audit of claims for payment of these services; identifying overpayments to individuals or entities receiving Federal funds; and educating providers of services, managed care entities, beneficiaries, and other individuals with respect to payment integrity and quality of care.

Under the provisions of Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, Section 6034, Congress directed the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP).  The Comprehensive Medicaid Integrity Plan (CMIP), developed in accordance with this legislation, will guide CMS efforts to fulfill this new obligation.  There are two broad responsibilities under this new program. 

	Reviewing the actions of individuals or entities furnishing items or services for which payment may be made by Medicaid; conducting audits of claims for payment; identifying overpayments and educating providers and others on payment integrity and quality of care; and

	Providing effective support and assistance to the States to combat Medicaid fraud, waste, and abuse.

CMS hired a contractor to develop a Medicaid Payment Integrity Audit System.  The Contractor is developing four protocols for the Medicaid Integrity Contractor(s) (MIC) to use when reviewing actions of Medicaid providers.  The protocols consist of 1) Reviewing the actions of individuals or entities furnishing items or services for which payment may be made by Medicaid; 2) conducting audits of claims for payment; 3) identifying overpayments and 4) educating providers and others on payment integrity and quality of care.  The Independent Evaluation Contractor will be required to review and test the protocols developed by this Contractor.

The purpose of this contract(s) is to have a Contractor evaluate and test the audit protocols developed by CMS Audit Protocol Development (APD) Contractor.  The Contractor shall evaluate and test the design of the audit program by ensuring the audit protocols include valid and reliable methodologies to meet the requirements of Section 6034 of the DRA described in the background section above.  

The major activities under this contract are:

1.	Development of Protocol Testing Plan.  The Contractor shall review the draft protocols developed by the APD Contractor and develop a plan for evaluating and testing the audit protocols and providing recommendations for the revision of the protocols
 

2.	Testing of the audit protocols.  The Contractor shall test the draft APD audit protocols developed for each of the four statutorily mandated MIC activities as follows:

X	The effectiveness in evaluating the actions of the individuals or entities furnishing items or services for which payment may be made by Medicaid;
X	The effectiveness of determining accuracy of paid claims to ensure compliance with Medicaid rules and regulations; 
X	The effectiveness of identifying inappropriate payments; and 
X	The effectiveness in educating providers and others on payment integrity and quality of care based on audit findings.  

Testing the audit protocols to verify the accuracy of paid claims will include the examination of Provider's paid claims and documentation to determine any inappropriate payments.  Any identified  inappropriate payments and other related appropriate actions will be recommended to the CMS Project Officer (PO).

Please submit your Capability Statement responses to the requirements above in the following manner: 1. E-mail your responses addressing your capability to perform the requirements detailed above to john.cruse@cms.hhs.gov on or before 12:00 PM (noon) local time Baltimore, MD  Friday, January 19, 2007.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE This Notice provides to the potential proposers a broad overview of this procurement.  The Notice explains the overall problem the Government desires to remedy through this procurement, explains the Governments approach to the procurement, providing gener al information on the method of selection, and outlines how the Government plans to make key technical data available to the proposers. NAICS: 237990; FSC: Y299 and SIC: 1629 Work estimated price range is $100M and $400M.  The Period of Performance complet ion date is 2010. PROBLEM: The Government seeks, through the solicitation and award of a Design Build Contract, a remedy for a hurricane protection related problem in the New Orleans area.  The problem is one of the most damaged areas by post Katrina flooding was the area a long the IHNC in the City of New Orleans.  The Congress of the United States has tasked the Corps of Engineers with the modification of the Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity Hurricane Protection Project by improving flood protection at the IHNC.  Minimum flo od protection required is 100 year water and wave loading as provided in Corps of Engineers Report, Elevations for Initial Design of Hurricane Protection Levees and Structures within the New Orleans District.   After alternative concept review the Corps of Engineers has determined that there are several locations where modifications can be affected by constructing flood closure gates across the GIWW, the MRGO and the IHNC at Seabrook.   Each location offers a varying degree of protection to surrounding ar eas.  In addition the Corps of Engineers is dedicated to achieving the most protection using innovative techniques. Should available funding prevent a complete problem solution, the Government may utilize the available funds to provide the most cost effect ive partial solution. This work is authorized under Public Law 109-234, wherein Congress has authorized funding to improve protection at the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal. Should available funding prevent a complete problem solution, the Government may utilize the available funds to provide the most cost effective partial solution. APPROACH AND SELECTION:  Confident that the Design Build delivery approach will save time, and generate holistic, innovative solutions to the problem above, the Government intends to procure Design Build services by means of the Corps of Engineers Two-Step method (FAR Part 36.3).  In step one, the Army Corps of Engineers will issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ), and from respondents to that RFQ, select, based on qualification, a short list of three to five firms.  In step two, the Corps of Engineers will issue the Design Build  Request for Proposals (RFP) to the three to five short listed firms and request their proposed technical approach, and associated price.  The Government will select a single technical approach on Best Value. To encourage innovative solutions to the stated problem, the Government will not prescribe a design but rather provide key technical data to the shortlisted firms, along with design criteria.  The Corps of Engineers has two AE firms under contract, develop ing pre-design engineering and environmental data.   This data will be made available to proposers for their use (if they wish) and to verify that there is at least one feasible engineering solution to the problem.  The task of selecting the best technical  approach and optimizing that approach is left to the proposers.    The Government however, has no particular bias toward any particular technical approach studied by any of its contractors.   It remains the responsibility of the proposer to collect any ad ditional data they determine necessary to develop their technical approach. While the RFP selection criteria have not been fully solidified, at least the following Factors are currently under consider ation:  Organization of DB Team, Specialized Experience (relating to similar work), Key Personnel Experience, and Technical Approach to Solving the Problem, and Past Use of Small Business. The NEPA Process is also an important element of the project. The Government is interested in using proposer input to improve its RFP, and if time permits, there may be the issuance of a draft RFP, followed by a pre-proposal conference, and then the issuance of the final RFP to the shortlisted firms. The contract type, whether lump sum, cost based, or fee based has not yet been determined. Sharing of Key Technical Data.   As was described above, the Government will select a shortlist based on qualification prior to collection of all project engineering data and completion of the design criteria.  After selection of the shortlisted firms, and prior to issuance of the RFP, th e Corps of Engineers may engage in exchanges of information with the shortlisted firms in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  In these exchanges, technical engineering and environmental data may be made available and discussed.  It is anticipated that attendees to these exchanges may include some local stakeholders and environmental regulators.  These exchanges may be considered when the Government is finalizing its engineering and environmental reports and the RFP. RESPONSE: Please indicate interest as a potential offeror (prime or joint venture partner) to this planned procurement by responding to Karen Golden via letter or e-mail at: U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Contracting Division ATTN:  Karen Golden HPO, Rm 167 PO Box 60267 New Orleans, LA 70160-0267 Karen.Golden3@mvk02.usace.army.mil The Government invites your comments and concerns to this planned procurement, as described above.

<SUBJECT>D -- SNOMED-CT and Related Services
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) and U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization, Copenhagen Hospital Corporation, Copenhagen, Denmark, for a multi-year contract as defined by FAR Part 17 Multi-Year Contracts (specifically, FAR Part 17.104, Part 17.105, & Part 17.106) .  The contract will provide NLM with at least twice-yearly updates to the English and Spanish versions of SNOMED CT, originally developed by the College of American Pathologists, and a license to incorporate SNOMED-CT updates into the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus (National Library of Medicine registered trademarks); to use SNOMED-CT within the UMLS Metathesaurus for research purposes within the NLM, in NLM?s production data creation systems, and in its publicly accessible retrieval systems; and to redistribute SNOMED-CT, within the UMLS Metathesaurus or otherwise, free-of-charge to U.S. entities for use within the U.S. for any health care, public health, research, educational, or statistical purposes.  SNOMED-CT is a comprehensive, multi-axial, controlled terminology intended for use in patient, public health, and research data.  SNOMED CT has been recommended as U.S. standard by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, has been adopted as a U.S.-government wide standard by the interagency Consolidated Health Informatics Initiative, and is part of several U.S. Interoperability Specifications recently released by the Health Information Technology Standards Panel under contract to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Department of Health and Human Services.  In June 2003, NLM entered into a 5-year contract with the College of American Pathologists to obtain updates to SNOMED CT under similar license terms.  The College of American Pathologists has announced its intention to transfer their intellectual property in SNOMED-CT to the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization in early 2007 (reference FAR 52.217-2 Cancellation with respect to contract cancellation).

Since SNOMED-CT will then become a proprietary product of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization, NLM has determined that the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization is the only source capable of providing the software and the ongoing software updates. Responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.

Capability statements and related materials must be received in this office by 4:00 p.m. EST on the closing date of this announcement.     
 		
If you have any questions, please contact Maxwell Kimpson at (301) 496-6546 or by email at kimpsonm@mail.nlm.nih.gov.  Collect calls will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>16 -- AMP Aircraft Site Survey
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air Systems Command, PMA-207C3, Patuxent River, MD intends to hold an aircraft site survey.     
The goal of the survey will be to provide aircraft access for industry in preparation for the potential release of an RFP for the C/KC-130T Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  The Navy is looking to upgrade the avionics subsystems for the USMC KC-130T and Navy C-130T aircraft.  The desired modernization solution will be accomplished by replacing aging, unreliable equipment and adding additional equipment necessary to meet Communication, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  The end solution will reduce parts obsolescence and maintenance work and reduce aircrew size while providing increased situational awareness to the aircrew.  The solution will also provide full internal and external night vision compatible lighting in an integrated open system architecture to reduce the impact of future upgrades.  The modernization solution should reuse appropriate existing aircraft systems as well as integrate the existing defensive systems.  The Navy desires to leverage off existing modernization programs, solutions and proven technology.

Each prime contractor team will have a 2 hour block to survey the aircraft and within this 2 hour block they will receive an in-brief, process through maintenance control at the squadron, and then out to the aircraft to complete their survey. Strict time will be kept with a countdown imposed to ensure the contractors are off the aircraft within their allotted time. Each team taken to the aircraft will have their possessions inventoried (i.e. pens, pencils, clip boards, note pads, cameras, measuring equipment, and tools). A flight engineer will be available at the aircraft to assist as required and answer questions concerning the current configuation not the potential RFP release.  The contractors will be allowed to take measurements, still pictures, and video. 

There will be power on the aircraft throughout the event. The following areas will be made accessible: 1) The under deck rack, 2) Circuit breaker panels will be opened,
3) Panels aft of the 245 bulkhead will be opened, 4) Some external panels may be opened weather permitting, 5) Stands and or man lifts will be available if required to look at external features.

This aircraft survey is limited to prime contractors, with each company limited to 10 attendees.  The contractors are encouraged to include their subcontractors as part of their attendees.

The survey is scheduled to be held on 6, 7, and 8 February 2007 aboard the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD 20670.  Parties interested in attending the conference are encouraged to contact Ms. Jackie Mercer via e-mail Jackie.mercer@navy.mil and  Ms. Mary Ann Foran via e-mail Maryann.foran@navy.mil. 

All interested parties, please provide the following information: Organization name and address, primary POC, phone/fax and e-mail of the primary POC, and the number of personnel attending.  

THE AIRCRAFT SITE SURVEY IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED OR FOR ANY TRAVEL RELATED EXPENSES.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Developing a More Strategic Approach to Federal Student Financial Aid for Higher Education

Background:

Federal student financial aid falls generally into three categories: grants, loans, and tax benefits. Statutes and regulations have created more than twenty federal student aid programs that do not harmonize to meet a comprehensive national policy goal. The Spellings Commission on the Future of Education describes the current system in its final report, "A Test of Leadership":

"We found that that our financial aid system is confusing, complex, inefficient, duplicative, and frequently does not direct aid to students who truly need it. We propose replacing the current maze of financial aid programs, rules, and regulations with a system more in line with student needs and national priorities. That effort would require a significant increase in need-based financial aid and a complete restructuring of the current federal financial aid system. Our recommendations call for consolidating programs, streamlining processes, and replacing the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) with a much shorter and simpler application."

For reference, please see the attached Issue Paper written for the Commission on the Future of Higher Education at http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/hiedfuture/reports/burgdorf-kostka.pdf.

Goal and Scope of the Effort:

1.  Overall goal - Create a vision for federal student financial aid that is aligned with strategic access and retention goals, develop the associated design, and perform a cost/benefit analysis for the implementation plan.

2.  Scope of effort - A two-stage review of the federal student aid system with recommendations for the optimal design and implementation of a system that achieves the following policy objectives: 1) increased enrollment in college by those students who would not have been able to attend; 2) increased retention and graduation by students who might not have been to complete college due to cost, and 3) decreased debt burden.

Outcomes Desired from a Two-Stage Approach:

1.  Phase 1: Vision Facilitation & Creation -The Department of Education (ED) seeks an independent, expert, and expedited process for developing a vision for an entirely new federal student financial aid system. ED seeks a contractor that can provide two expert management consultants to serve as facilitators of this expedited process.

A new federal student aid system should achieve the policy objectives described above and address (at least) the following key issues:

A)  Complexity and confusion among users, leading to underutilization and yielding little data to understand their impact on access and retention;
B)  Countervailing incentives and disincentives for buyers of higher education, and
C)  Overlapping and redundant programs.

The contractor shall deliver this vision through facilitation of two simultaneous workshops comprised of no more than 15 experts per workshop. These workshops shall be held over a two-day period on or before February 16, 2007 in Washington, D.C. Experts will be identified and invited by ED. ED will manage all logistical aspects of the workshops, including site identification and material preparation.

The contractor shall facilitate the experts' review of existing student aid programs, eligibility criteria, benefits incentives, and application and verification processes. The contractor shall plan workshops that will yield options for federal student financial aid that will more effectively:

* Focus Federal resources to students with greatest need;

* Make the student aid programs more understandable and predictable for students and families;

* Address real and perceived concerns about the financial burden on students and families of college;

*Refocus Federal, state, and institutional partnerships in support of the policy objectives;

* Minimize or eliminate the relationship between Federal subsidies, tuition and institutional cost increases;

* Minimize the extent to which Federal laws and rules encourage a substitution of state and institutional expenditures for higher education;

* Reduce the expensive, burdensome and intrusive role of higher education institutions in validating family income data for aid eligibility;

* Reduce the potential for identity theft among aid applicants; and

* Make the programs easier to administer and more accountable to the taxpayer. 

The contractor shall submit a workshop-planning memo to the Department of Education within 10 business days after purchase order is issued for this phase. The contractor shall participate in a debriefing with ED leadership and staff by February 28, 2007. During this debriefing, the contractor shall provide expert opinion on:

* Comprehensive policy goals toward which current and future programs could be aligned to increase access and retention 

* Guiding principles for current and future programs that can serve to both guide changes to existing programs and to assess whether proposals for new programs or changes to existing programs or policies would be effective.

* A high-level assessment of how the current 17 programs align to the policy goals and guiding principles to both validate the goals and guiding principles, and to identify specific improvement items for more focused attention.  

* Critical design elements for a comprehensive solution to federal student financial aid programs that add sufficient clarity to the guiding principles that will accelerate the overall solution design.

The contractor is only expected to plan and facilitate the workshops, and participate in a debriefing with ED leadership and staff. ED will be responsible for transcribing the workshops and preparing written documentation of recommendations. Existing data, research and program assessments will be used rather than the collection or analysis of new data, research or assessments.

2. Phase 2: Solution Design and Implementation Planning - Using the Vision created by Phase 1, the second phase will focus on solution design feasibility testing along with the development of implementation plans, the cost/benefit analysis and the required detail to make specific changes to existing policies, programs, technology and any other requirements to implement the vision.

A) Solution Feasibility Testing - Identify, assess and recommend the specific changes to the existing 17 programs required to achieve the overall comprehensive policy goals, in line with the guiding principles and addressing the key design elements set forth in the first phase of this effort.  

B) Implementation Planning - Identify, assess and recommend the activities, work efforts and projects required to implement the solutions developed above.

C) Cost/Benefit Analysis 

For Phase 2, the Department of Education will issue a separate Request for Proposals no later than March 2007.

If the commercial license agreement is not made an addendum, it shall not apply, govern, be a part of or have any effect whatsoever on the Contract; this includes, but is not limited to, any agreement embedded in the computer software (clickwrap) or any agreement that is otherwise delivered with or provided to the Government with the commercial computer software or documentation (shrinkwrap), or any other license agreement otherwise referred to in any document.  If a commercial license agreement is made an addendum, only those provisions addressing data rights regarding the Government’s use, duplication and disclosure of data (e.g., restricted computer software) are included and made a part of this Contract, and only to the extent that those provisions are not duplicative or inconsistent with Federal law, Federal regulation, the incorporated FAR clauses and the provisions of this Contract, including Addendums A & B; those provisions in the commercial license agreement that do not address data rights regarding the Government’s use, duplication and disclosure of data shall not be included or made a part of the Contract.

If any such code is present, the Contractor agrees to indemnify the Government for all damages suffered as a result of a disabling caused by such code, and the Contractor agrees to remove such code upon the Government’s request at no extra price to the Government.  Inability of the Contractor to remove the disabling software code will be considered an inexcusable delay and a material breach of the contract, and the Government may exercise its right to terminate for cause.  In addition, the Government is permitted to remove the code as it deems appropriate and charge the Contractor for consideration for the time and effort in removing the code.

incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's Air Resources Laboratory requires a fully automated gas and particle detection system, capable of measuring trace levels of elemental mercury (Hg?), reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) and fine particulate mercury (FPM).  ARL envisions the detection system as three distinct components for Hg?, RGM and FPM.  The units must be fully compatible with one another, and be capable of routine operation, unattended for periods of approximately one week.

The Hg? detector must provide continuous data, time averaged over user-selectable intervals of 30 minutes to 6 hours.  The units should be capable of self-cleaning and self-calibration and any adsorption or trapping medium necessary to collect the mercury compounds should be self-regenerating for a period of at least one week, before replacement of the collection medium is required.  Detector module should have RS-232 signal and status outputs, as well as status and control input capability to allow remote instrument operation and calibration.  Products must be durable and function extremely well in a variety of often-harsh operating environments.  

The analyzer shall be a compact, self-contained, rack mountable unit, complete with internal pump, user-serviceable pre-concentration traps, heaters, mass-flow meter and controllers, a cold vapor atomic fluorescence detector, and calibration source.  It must be a portable unit that may be used indoors or in the field to monitor background vapor-phase mercury levels to a detection level in the *sub-ng/m3* regime at a cycle time of five minutes or less.  The analyzer must be capable of operation without an external data-logger or computer, and should possess analog, digital and RS-232 outputs to allow it to be integrated with a serial data-logger, PC-based system or any air quality telemetry system. The analyzer must be equipped with dual, gold-column amalgamation cartridges which allow for true, continuous sampling of an air stream, with no gaps in the data collected. While one cartridge is sampling ambient air the other is in the process of being analyzed.  The mercury vapor cartridges should be made of pure gold, and should be able to withstand many thousands of sampling and desorption cycles without degradation in performance.  The duty cycle must be sufficiently short as to allow for near-real-time data collection, with a minimum rate of not more than 2.5 minutes per cycle.  The analyzer must be equipped with an internal mercury calibration source that allows the instrument to re-calibrate itself automatically; thus allowing unattended operation for extended periods of time. The analyzer must be equipped with a bypass valve that prevents contaminated air from coming in contact with the detector, thus making cleaning operations infrequent.  The detector in the analyzer must have an inert gas purge feature to improve stability, thus necessitating only infrequent adjustments to the GAIN and SENSITIVITY controls.  The analyzer must utilize an electronic mass-flow meter or controller to measure ambient air sample flow rate. If using a mass flow meter, the analyzer must utilize a microprocessor controlled feedback loop between the mass flow meter and pump to ensure accurate sample flow rates and sample volume measurements. The analyzer must use an electronic mass-flow controller to regulate carrier gas flow during analysis, and should automatically shut off gas flow in the event of a power failure. This allows optimal usage of the UHP Argon carrier gas.

The following items to be acquired are identified with Tekran-manufactured model numbers.  Notwithstanding the identification of these model numbers, any product that has the capability of meeting form, fit and function of the identified products will be evaluated.

Model 2537A Mercury Vapor Analyzer, with the following options:  Internal Permeation Source (#001), Aluminum Transit Case (#020), Rack Mount Ears (#010).  Model 1130 Mercury Speciation Unit with the following options: Replacement Denuders (#010) quantity six, Model 1102 Air Dryer, Shipping case for pump module (#020), shipping case for Denuder (#030).  Model 1135 Particulate Mercury Unit with the following options:  Spare quartz filter assembly (#010) quantity four, Aluminum shipping case (#020), DataCom (#100), 50' heated line with therrmostatic controller.  All quantities are one, unless otherwise indicated.

Incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Number 2005-15. The provisions and clauses may be downloaded at http://www.arnet.gov/far. The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-l, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items. The Government may award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror conforming to the solicitation which will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) approach, (ii) past performance, (iii) price; FAR 52-212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. All interested contractors must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at the CCR website (www.ccr.gov).

These items will be acquired using simplified acquisition procedures, FAR Parts 12 and 13 utilizing the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this RFQ to a responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable process.  Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.
Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the Scope of Work (SOW).  ?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the SOW.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
                                              
Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Offerors must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS with the price offer, or may complete the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include the certifications along with a price proposal will render an offeror ineligible for award.   All questions and inquiries should be addressed via email to the Contract Specialist POC, daniel.herring@dla.mil, Request for Quote Number SP3100-6339-3021.  Prices, representations/certifications, descriptive literature, and past performance information must be received NLT 4:00 PM EST on February 5, 2007.  This information should be submitted to the above email address or faxed to 717-770-7591.  Contractors must be capable of accepting payment by either electronic funds transfer or government credit card for this procurement.  ALL SOURCES MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACT REGISTRATION DATABASE, http://www.ccr.gov/, or an award cannot be processed.

A: No Q: In building 920 we are installing a fiber optic patch panel into an existing rack, is that panel to be 12 or 24 port? A.12 Port Q: In your price request, you specifically call out Install a new 19 rack mount fiber shelf able to support up to 60 terminations.  Two will actually be required, one in Bldg 920 and one in the CNDSF.  Are both shelves to be supplied by this contractor or does the ONG expect to reuse one?  Ordinarily we would go ahead and quote two, but since your scope specifically calls for one I am wondering about the other.
