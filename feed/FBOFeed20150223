<DESC>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-NHANES Genetics
<p>February 23, 2015 <br />Solicitation Number: XYZZY-2015-RFI-NHANES Genetic<br />Agency: Department of Health and Human Services<br />Office: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<br />Notice Type: Request for Information/Sources Sought</p>
<p>Please ensure that your e-mail response has "XYZZY-2015-RFI-NHANES Genetics" in the subject line. Any responses received after the specified deadline date and time will not be accepted or acknowledged.</p>
<p>This is a request for information only. It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p><br />Background: <br />The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES is a major program of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and has the responsibility for producing vital and health statistics for the Nation. NHANES is overseen by the Division of Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (DHNES).</p>
<p>As part of the NHANES physical exams, blood is collected from participating sample persons. During several NHANES survey cycles, blood samples were collected for future genetics research during certain NHANES survey cycles. Currently, there are more than 20,000 DNA specimens.</p>
<p>The NHANES DNA Bio-repository opened to researchers in 1999. Since then, multiple researchers have received specimens through the proposal process, and linked research results have been made available through the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC). The NHANES DNA Bio-repository closed in 2012 to review criteria for reporting of results. DHANES is now hoping to reopen its DNA Bio-repository for genetics research within the year. Accordingly, DNA specimens will need to be processed, stored and prepared for outside research use and maintained in a new molecular biology laboratory.</p>
<p>More information can be found on the NHANES web site: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm as well as the NCHS web site: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm. Information on the NHANES Genetics program can be found on http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/genetics/genetic.htm.</p>
<p><br />NHANES Contract Evaluation Criteria: <br />Interested parties are hereby notified that we the solicitation and all of its parts are to be openly competed. In the event of a Government solicitation for an NHANES contract, the evaluation criteria will most likely be based on the skills, experience, innovation, cost control, and past performance of each offeror in the corresponding area listed below.</p>
<p><br />RFI Purpose: <br />The purpose of this RFI is to obtain current and innovative ideas for DNA processing and storing, identify operational strategies for the logistics requirements (e.g. QA, inventory, shipping and receiving, etc.), and solicit industry comments and questions regarding a planned solicitation for DNA processing and storing.</p>
<p><br />Information Requested:</p>
<p>We ask that the responder address the following areas:</p>
<p>1) DNA Processing<br />Provide a brief summary on your approach to assembling a complete set of DNA from an NHANES survey cycle, including the processes for measuring DNA concentrations, normalizing DNA, creating aliquots of DNA for outside researchers, and quality assurance procedures used to evaluate DNA integrity, minimize degradation, and assure sample order. Responses to questions regarding DNA processing are limited to four (4) pages, double-spaced, in Times New Roman 12 font, and 1" margins. Please include sufficient detail to demonstrate your capability in the corresponding functional area. Responses using multimedia or video are limited to twelve (12) minutes in duration.</p>

<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 3-10-15.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Approved source is: Vacco Industries (99517).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

This high elevation project will most likely see snow in early October, and it may stick around until mid-July.</p>
<strong>Description of Work: </strong>The project includes the restoration of less than 3 miles of Continental Divide National Scenic Trail No. 9 within the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness. The trail is extremely rugged and has poor access. Clearing and grubbing are included as their own line item for restoration clearing and grubbing, no clearing and grubbing is to occur along new trail, this project is entirely along an existing trail. Due to the large number of rocks to be removed from the trail tread and backslope it is advised that the contractor either have a certified blaster on their payroll, or be one themselves.<strong> </strong>See Section 205 of the specifications for requirements for blasting plans.
<p>The trail will not be closed to curious hikers along the trail. The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail is one of high popularity during the summer months. Please be courteous to hikers and horsemen.&nbsp; 200 feet of turnpike is located near STA 50. These sections of turnpike shall be constructed by volunteers. Some of the volunteers shall be part of a Montana Wilderness "Vacation" other volunteers shall be part of the St. Louis, Missouri AmeriCorps team. Both groups may be working simultaneously while this contract is ongoing.</p>

<p>Nonhuman Primate Major Histocompatibility Complex Allele Discovery and <br />Typing Technology Development</p>
<p>BAA NIAID-DAIT-NIHAI2015033</p>
<p><br />Presolicitation Notice Information</p>
<p>Introduction<br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement entitled "Nonhuman Primate Major Histocompatibility Complex Allele Discovery and Typing Technology Development."<br />Description</p>
<p>NHPs approximate human physiology, immunology, and genetics more closely than other animals.  Therefore, they are often the preferred models to: 1) evaluate the safety and efficacy of candidate vaccines against human pathogens; 2) develop and evaluate immune-based therapeutic strategies to prevent graft rejection and graft versus host disease in cell, tissue, and organ transplantation; and 3) study the pathogenesis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases and evaluate novel immune-based therapies.  To support these continuing research efforts NIAID announces the re-competition of the NHP Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Gene Discovery and Typing Technology Development Program. The objectives of this program are to facilitate and extend the immunological and infectious disease research conducted with these important models by providing detailed knowledge of NHP MHC and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes, loci, and alleles through gene discovery and tissue expression studies; and by developing and providing readily accessible means or methods to genotype individual research animals for the complete set of MHC or KIR alleles, or for select alleles, for the optimum design of experiments and genetic management of colonies.</p>
<p>The most commonly used NHP species in immunological and infectious disease research are the Old World NHPs, including the cynomolgus or long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis), the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), the baboon (multiple Papio species), sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys) and the pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina).  For purposes of this solicitation, NHP is used to denote the Old World monkey Macaca sp., unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>As in humans, the MHC region is the most polymorphic of the NHP genome, with a high degree of genetic diversity across the population. The MHC region includes MHC Class I and Class II genes, which encode cell surface proteins that serve a critical role in the adaptive immune response. NHP MHC Class I and Class II orthologs from Old World macaques exist for most of the human MHC genes. However, a striking difference between the human and the macaque species is that the NHP MHC Class I loci have undergone multiple duplication and expansion events resulting in a significantly greater number of expressed MHC Class I A and B genes per animal than in humans. Transcription levels of different NHP MHC Class I genes can vary widely.  In addition, the numbers of MHC Class I A and B loci can differ significantly among animals within a population. The NHP MHC Class II region also has been subject to more gene duplication and expansion than its human counterpart. Studies of multiple macaque species reveal similarly increased MHC genomic complexity over that of humans and great apes.</p>
<p>Recent progress has been made in characterizing the NHP MHC Class I and Class II region genomic organization in rhesus macaques. This knowledge of the genomic structure from multiple haplotypes and species of NHPs may help resolve the MHC organization and facilitate future gene discovery efforts. Although much progress has been made towards MHC Class I allele discovery for the Indian rhesus macaque, continued and more refined gene, locus, and allele analysis and discovery work is still needed for this and most other macaque species and subspecies.  Further MHC Class II discovery efforts are also needed in these species. It is also necessary to establish allele or haplotype frequencies within individual colonies or sources (i.e., country origin) of animals used by the research community.  In addition to gene discovery, studies are needed to describe differential expression of MHC genes in cells and/or tissues germane to immunology, infectious disease and transplant researchers under relevant physiological conditions, such as inflammation, or under iatrogenic conditions such as immunosuppression.</p>
<p>In contrast to the progress made on MHC characterization in NHPs, much less is known about the related killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR).  The KIR system in NHPs is more complex than the MHC, containing more genes, more alleles, and a large degree of haplotype diversity.  More detailed genetic characterization of the KIR system, including allele discovery, is important for understanding KIR/MHC interactions by researchers in the transplant and especially infectious disease communities. The inchoate state of NHP KIR databases and nomenclature remains a significant obstacle to progress in this area.  An effort to standardize NHP KIR nomenclature, possibly leading to official assignment of KIR allele names, would be valuable and establish a framework for future characterization efforts.</p>
<p>Identification of the complete set of MHC alleles present in an animal has historically required technically challenging and time- and labor-intensive methods and provided no certainty that all alleles or loci within an individual were detected. Furthermore, the availability of defined genotyping methods or resources for typing of individual alleles is quite limited compared to the large number of alleles already identified. Development of, and access to, high-throughput technologies for MHC and/or KIR allele genotyping and/or haplotype determination are required to accelerate immunological studies in NHP species. Historically, the variety of DNA-based methods have included: reference strand conformational analysis (RSCA), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP), sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) and MHC-linked microsatellites, or short tandem repeats (STRs). The level and accuracy of information provided and the potential limitations differ by technique.</p>
<p>A variety of DNA-based technologies is required for the diverse needs of the NHP research community, including methods for specific allele genotyping, haplotyping, and complete MHC and/or KIR genotyping. Affordable methods that are easily upgraded as new allelic or haplotype information becomes available are needed.  For those methods not provided through resource services, they need to be relatively high-throughput and easily translatable to laboratories conducting NHP research. Recent advances have been made by the previous awardees to refine and streamline NHP MHC genotyping, and the continued evolution of sequencing technology will allow for further improvements.</p>
<p>This solicitation to re-compete the NHP MHC Gene Discovery and Typing Development Program will continue and expand upon the initial program goals to advance the detailed knowledge base of NHP MHC genetic loci, alleles, and haplotypes, and their frequencies; expand discovery and characterization of NHP KIR genes, alleles, haplotypes, and frequencies; and develop robust, high-throughput genotyping and haplotyping methods.</p>
<p>Offers submitted in response to this BAA must present detailed technical and business proposals designed to meet the Research and Technical Objectives described. The Statement of Work, including the specific technical requirements and performance specifications, is developed and proposed by the offeror, not the Government.</p>
<p>Proposals are NOT evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common Statement of Work issued by the Government.  Instead, Research and Technical Objectives are provided in the BAA that describe the research areas in which the Government is interested.  Proposals received in response to the BAA are evaluated in accordance with Evaluation Factors for Award specified in Section M.   The NIAID will assess whether the work proposed should be redirected, removed, and/or whether schedule or budget adjustments should be made.  As a result, during discussions with offerors, the NIAID reserves the right to modify or delete proposed milestones, decision points, research plans, process, schedule, budget or product.   The selection of proposals for award is based upon the evaluation factors, importance to the agency programs (programmatic balance), and fund availability.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one to two cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a five (5)-year period of performance beginning on or about April 1, 2016.</p>
<p>NIAID estimates that the average annual total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) is $1.0M for all contract awards made under this announcement.  However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s).  The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed five (5) years.</p>

<DESC>This is a market survey/sources sought for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey/sources sought or otherwise pay for information solicited. The Government will utilize the information provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources, specifically small business sources, capable of manufacturing and delivering the following item: M22 Simulator, Cartridge, ATWESS (Anti-Tank Weapons Effect Signature Simulator), NSN: 1370-01-085-2601, DODIC: L367. <br>  <br> The M22 ATWESS consists of a percussion primer, first fire composition, flash composition, plastic case and other plastic parts. This simulator is used to replicate anti-tank guided missile and rocket launches when used in conjunction with a launching apparatus in a training environment. Upon ignition, the cartridge will produce a bright flash, loud report and smoke. The following functional characteristics are required for the M22 ATWESS: Temperature: shall function between 125 5 F and -25 5 F; Flash: flash signature shall be a minimum of six feet in length and two feet in width with duration of 40 to 500 milliseconds; Sound: sound intensity shall be 134 +6 -7 decibels for a maximum duration of 15 milliseconds with a rise time of 5 milliseconds. The flash composition currently contains 75% magnesium powder, 10% PTFE and 15% fluoroelastomer; however, the Government is pursuing a moisture resistant non-magnesium based flash composition for permanent replacement. The pyrotechnic composition is enclosed in a plastic tube inside a plastic case and sealed off with an end plate and a switch closure at either side. Top level drawing 12953563 is being provided with this sources sought/market survey. No further drawings or specifications will be provided at this time. <br>  <br> Interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information in the time-frame established below: a brief summary of the company's capabilities; description of facilities, business size as it applies to NAICS code 325920, Explosives Manufacturing - size standard 750 employees; personnel and related manufacturing experience; estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities with associated prices and lead-times; whether any of the items are currently in production or when last produced; the minimum procurement quantity (MPQ) required for economical production; and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for a quantity of 130,000 M22 ATWESS. Additionally, interested companies should note if manufacturing resources are shared with other item/production lines and identify the approximate amount shared. A respondent to this market survey must have available a majority of the skills that are required to manufacture these items. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate and should describe his or her ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. All contractors interested in this potential future solicitation must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) Database.  <br>  <br> Potential Production Concern: The composition of the pellet assembly is currently under reformulation and will be provided with the release of the Request for Proposal (RFP). While completing the R&D portion of the product improvement effort, a production concern surfaced with regard to the composition blending process.  During small scale production, the new composition proved successful and the simulator performed according to the specifications. However, when moving to a larger production batch there appeared to be issues with uniform pellet density and homogenous blending, which led to simulator degradation. The simulator did not function properly, causing excess venting which ultimately broke the launching device. This blending/venting issue may simply have been an anomaly caused by an unknown variable in the R&D environment. However, the Government is bringing the concern to the attention of potentially interested parties in an effort to ascertain whether it has any impact on willingness to bid on the RFP. <br>  <br> Interested firms have 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information to be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy for this item. Any response to this market research should reference the following: M22 Simulator, Cartridge, ATWESS (Anti-Tank Weapons Effect Signature Simulator) Market Survey. Please submit to Kurt L. Kleinlein by email at: kurt.l.kleinlein.civ@mail.mil or by mail to: US Army Contracting Command- Rock Island , ATTN: CCRC-AR, Mr. Kurt Kleinlein, Building 60, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 61299-8000. <br>

Should the transfer of the Land Reuse Authority (LRA) parcel occur, during the period of performance of the contract, the contract will be modified to incorporate: A revised PWS; an implementation schedule; and revised funding for the transition and implementation of the revised PWS. <br>  <br> It is the responsibility of potential offerors to be responsible for performing all operations and maintenance functions to support the former WRAMC Installation.

For informational purposes only, historical data regarding the dollar amount awarded under the current contract may be found on www.fpds.gov. <br>  <br> This required was previously put in the 8(a) program therefore in accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(3)(i), in order to determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency need exists, the Government will consider SSS responses received from all 8(a)'s.  Responses to this SSS permit the contracting officer, in accordance with FAR 19.203(c), to consider rather there are enough 8(a) concerns to allow for competition.  Provide suggestions on how the requirement could be structured to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.

<p>Contracting Office Address</p>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E140, Rockville, MD 20850, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis services to evaluate the association of the human fecal microbiota with the risk for colorectal cancer and precancer in a well defined population from Kaiser Foundation Hospitals Institution, 1800 Harrison St. Floor 14, Oakland, CA, 94612-3429.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15.0 Million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is conducting a study to evaluate whether the community of bacteria that resides in the colon (the microbiota) affects the risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) and precancer (colorectal adenoma, CRA). The gut microbiota is essential for human health and is postulated to play important roles in various human malignancies. Previous NCI research has shown that the diversity of and certain bacterial taxa within the fecal microbiota are associated with increased risk of CRC. Such associations for CRA are lacking, as are practical and cost-effective means for the collection and storage of fecal specimens that could be used for insights on the etiology of CRC/CRA and for diagnosis of these conditions at a curable stage. The specimen collection and related field work activities for this research effort will be conducted by the NCI intramural research program.</p>
<p><br />Contractor Requirements are:</p>
<p>The contractor will collect fecal immunochemical test (FIT) devices that undergo routine clinical testing as the initial step in CRC/CRA screening. For six months, the Contractor will freeze (-20C) all FIT devices found to have occult blood (FIT+) plus 96 without occult blood (FIT-negative controls). Of the many (more than 900) FIT+ devices frozen during the six-month interval, the Contractor will retain all of the FIT+ devices from patients subsequently found by colonoscopy to have CRA or CRC (FIT+ cases), as well as 2-fold additional FIT+ devices from patients found to have a normal colonoscopy (FIT+ controls).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall deliver at least 180 FIT+ cases, 360 FIT+ controls, and 96 FIT-negative controls. In four (no less than three, no more than six) approximately equal sized batches (e.g., every 6 weeks); the Contractor will deliver these by overnight courier (e.g., FedEx), on dry ice and in accordance with International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations, to the microbiome laboratory designated by NCI. The shipped devices will be labeled with a unique code but be devoid of any personal identifying information.</p>
<p>Matching each of the four shipments, the Contractor will assemble and deliver to NCI a data set with unique codes without personal identifying information; date of the specimen collection (or date of the FIT test); sex; age; race/ethnicity; FIT result (positive or negative); colonoscopy result [CRC (ICD-9 153 with stage), CRA (ICD-9 211.3, with tubular, tubulovillus, or both tubular and tubulovillous histology), normal FIT+, else FIT-negative]; body mass index (BMI); type 2 diabetes (ICD-9); date of most recent antibiotic prescription; prior cancer diagnosis (ICD-9, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer); date completed any cancer surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy prior to the shipped specimen.</p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 1 PM EST, on March 10, 2015. All responses and questions must be via email to Francisco Mendoza, Contracting Specialist at francisco.mendoza@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through sam.gov. Reference: N02C052528-78 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>1. Solicitation Number: HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-SS-2015-152</p>
<p>2. Title: Predictive Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Metabolomic Markers in Alzheimer's Disease</p>
<p>3. Classification Code: B</p>
<p>4. NAICS Code: 541711</p>
<p>5. Description: <br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><br />Background: There is currently a pressing need to identify predictive blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). With the repeated failures of multiple pivotal phase-III clinical trials in patients with AD, the emerging paradigm shift in Alzheimer's research calls for disease-modifying treatments to be initiated in older individuals who are in preclinical stages of disease i.e. prior to the onset of overt cognitive decline1. However, this raises the critical challenge of accurately identifying such at-risk individuals by non- invasive and inexpensive methods. If available, such methods will allow for the effective screening of large numbers of vulnerable individuals for recruitment into clinical trials and rapid testing of promising disease-modifying treatments.</p>
<p>Currently the only modalities that are available for this purpose are assays of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of A&beta;42 and tau (total and phosphorylated) and neuroimaging methods that quantify brain atrophy or fibrillar amyloid deposition. It is however unlikely that lumbar puncture (LP) will be routinely performed in large numbers of frail elderly individuals as it is associated with a degree of discomfort. Furthermore, it is impractical to perform serial LPs in an individual to monitor a biomarker response to treatment. On the other hand, neuroimaging methods are expensive and not readily available in resource-poor settings. We have therefore focused on blood-based biomarkers of AD that accurately reflect well-established endophenotypes of AD pathology such as brain atrophy, and in vivo fibrillar A&beta; deposition4-8. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses in combination with multi-modal neuroimaging, these studies have revealed a robust peripheral signal from the plasma proteome that appears to be associated with AD pathology.</p>
<p>The proposed project will use a method called quantitative targeted metabolomics for measuring the absolute concentrations of 180 metabolites in serum and post-mortem brain samples to discover predictive blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and markers of resilience to AD pathology. This method is a novel approach distinct from traditional and most widely used metabolomics methodology where only relative quantification of metabolites can be determined between different samples. Relative quantification provides limited information as it only allows comparative differences (i.e. lower or higher) between samples to be determined. In order to meet the goal of the proposed study i.e. the discovery of metabolites that can predict the onset of AD before clinical symptoms, accurate and absolute quantification of metabolites is a critical requirement. This is also the ultimate goal of the proposed biomarker study i.e. the development of a blood-test for the prediction of AD that could one day be used in clinical practice settings. This can only be accomplished by the accurate estimation of absolute metabolite concentrations in serum samples.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the tasks and deliverables described in the requirements and deliverables section. The main objective of the requirement is to:</p>
<p>1. Perform quantitative targeted metabolomics assays on approximately 800 human serum samples from non-demented older individuals and converters to AD to measure the concentrations of small metabolites in the following classes:<br />i) Phosphatidylcholines<br />ii) Phosphatidylserines<br />iii) Phosphatidylglycerols<br />iv) Phosphatidyethanolamines<br />v) Sphingomyelins<br />vi) Ceramides<br />vii) Eicosanoids and Prostaglandins<br />viii) Oxysterols</p>
<p>These samples will come from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA; N=400) and the Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS; N=400).</p>
<p>2. Perform quantitative targeted metabolomics assays on a random sample of approximately 400 human serum samples from non-demented older individuals in the Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS; N=400) to assay the following classes of small metabolites: <br />i) Amino Acids, Acylcarnitines, Lipids, Hexoses, Biogenic Amines &amp; Polyamines. <br />ii) Phosphatidylcholines<br />iii) Phosphatidylserines<br />iv) Phosphatidylglycerols<br />v) Phosphatidyethanolamines<br />vi) Sphingomyelins<br />vii) Ceramides<br />viii) Eicosanoids and Prostaglandins<br />ix) Oxysterols</p>
<p>3. Perform quantitative targeted metabolomics assays on approximately 200 human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from participants in the BIOCARD study to assay the following classes of small metabolites:</p>
<p>i) Amino Acids, Acylcarnitines, Lipids, Hexoses, Biogenic Amines &amp; Polyamines<br />ii) Phosphatidylcholines<br />iii) Phosphatidylserines<br />iv) Phosphatidylglycerols<br />v) Phosphatidyethanolamines<br />vi) Sphingomyelins<br />vii) Ceramides<br />viii) Eicosanoids and Prostaglandins<br />ix) Oxysterols</p>
<p>4. Perform statistical analysis (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) to identify small metabolite markers in serum and CSF that predict incident AD.</p>
<p><br />5. Return all unused specimens to their place of origin.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotations. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach.
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Information Security (OIS) is conducting a market survey for an Enterprise Governance, Risk, and Compliance (eGRC) tool to support HHS in managing security policies, controls, risks, assessments, and weaknesses through a single platform. The goal is to develop a single repository to document and store security information, allowing HHS to review and assess the security stance of systems. This approach facilitates real-time approval, monitoring, and reporting for all HHS systems. An automated GRC tool would allow system owners, information system security officers (ISSOs), privacy officers and security analysts to easily identify system weaknesses and issue resolutions with improved efficiencies.</p>
<p>Please see attached RFIOS149336 for additional details and submittal instructions.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Location: The project site is located in Romeoville, IL, where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates electric dispersal barriers in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC). The CSSC is a man-made waterway creating the only continuous connection between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River basin. The dispersal barrier system prevents the spread of invasive fish species between the watersheds. The address is 790 E. Old Romeo Road, Lockport IL, 60441. The facility is situated on the east bank of the CSSC immediately north of the 135th Street bridge.</p>
<p><br />Purpose: The USACE-Chicago District seeks to identify firms capable of providing a water treatment system for an existing cooling tower at Dispersal Barrier IIB. The Government wishes to identify the range of treatment options available and understand the benefits and drawbacks of each technical approach.</p>
<p><br />GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS:<br /><br />The proposed contract is envisioned to be awarded as a Firm-Fixed Priced Construction Contract with a 120 calendar day performance period.<br /><br />The work under this contract will include (but not limited to): Implementing a treatment system that reduces/eliminates hard water scaling, bio-fouling, and the risk of bacterial pathogens in the system. System shall be maintainable with minimal operation/maintenance concerns and use of nonhazardous, environmentally neutral, chemical admixtures (i.e., ARARs: applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements). Discharges shall meeting current discharge permit standards, increase water tower efficiency, minimize water use, and minimize waste.</p>
<p><br />The cooling tower requiring water treatment is located within the Dispersal Barrier 2B building and is fed by two groundwater wells. Groundwater samples were found to contain hardness ranging between 250 and 660 mg/L as CaCO3. Average daily flow rates through the tower range from 0.1 to 2.0 gallons per minute. The maximum flow rate for the tower is 20 gpm.</p>
<p><br />The current NPDES discharge permit requires that the temperature of the cooling tower effluent not exceed 93&deg;F (34&deg;C) more than 5% of the time, or 100&deg;F (37.8&deg;C) at any time. Effluent pH shall be in the range of 6.0 to 9.0. No effluent shall contain settleable solids, floating debris, visible oil, grease, scum or sludge solids, color, odor, and turbidity must be reduced to below obvious levels. The current permit limits this discharge to non-contact cooling water only, free from additives and other process wastewaters.</p>
<p><br />To meet the approval of permitting agencies, the cooling tower effluent will be expected to comply with the standards for "Secondary Contact and Indigenous Aquatic Life Waters," as defined by the Illinois Administrative Code, Title 35, Chapter 1, Subtitle C, Part 302, Sections 401-408. Any water treatment additives toxic to aquatic life must be released in sufficiently dilute concentrations, i.e. less than half of the product's median lethal concentration (LC50), or less than half of the 96-hour median tolerance limit (96-hour TLm) for native fish or essential fish food organisms.</p>
<p><br />SCOPE OF CAPABILITIES:</p>
<p><br />The USACE-Chicago District is searching for contractors that are capable of executing the work described above.</p>
<p><br />REQUESTED INFORMATION:</p>
<p><br />Since this notice is being used to assess the extent of Firms capable of fulfilling the government's requirements, this Agency requests that interested contractors complete the following questions to assist the government in its efforts.</p>
<p><br />1. Is your firm capable of executing the work herein or provide subcontracting capabilities.</p>
<p><br />2. Is your company currently registered with the System For Award Management (SAM) Database? If not, has it been registered or does it plan to register?</p>
<p><br />3. In consideration of NAICS code 237990, with a small business size standard in dollars of $36.5 Million, which of the following small business categories is your business classified under, if any? Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, HUB Zone Small Business, or 8(a) Business.</p>
<p><br />4. Is your company currently prohibited from doing business with the Federal Government? Yes / No (If yes, explain.)</p>
<p><br />5. Is the potential offeror capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for a project valued between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000?</p>
<p><br />6. Is the potential offeror a small-business interested in performing as a subcontractor to one of the items of work?</p>
<p><br />7. Is the potential offeror capable of adhering to a Small Business Subcontracting Plan where at least 50% of the work will be requested to be performed by a small business?</p>
<p><br />8. Ability to provide a bid for this project if advertised during the month of May to June?</p>
<p><br />9. Is your interest in this project high, medium or low?</p>
<p><br />10. Please provide information about the type of treatment technologies that your firm is equipped to deliver for this application, including but not limited to:</p>
<p><br />a. Footprint of equipment;<br />b. Types of additives needed, concentrations and dose of any chemicals<br />c. Waste produced by system, and waste handling or disposal requirements<br />d.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">23 Feb 2015</p>
<p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized and award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays and duplication of costs in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>The Government has conducted extensive market research leading up to development of its acquisition strategy. As a result, the Government found that the Space Test and Engineering 2009 Contract (STEC09) incumbent contractor is the only source that can provide the immediate services for the current critical mission. As the current STEC09 contract ordering period has expired, the Government requires a short nine-month bridge contract to cover the gap for a follow-on contract. This action will give the Government enough time to award the follow on Space Test and Engineering 2014 Contract (STEC14).</p>
<p>This sole source contract will allow the incumbent, LinQuest Corporation, to provide continuing satellite operations support at SMC/ADG's Research Development Test and Evaluation Support Complex (RSC) at Kirtland AFB, NM. The existing STEC09 contract will expire 13 May 2015, there is continuing need to maintain the capability to conduct RSC mission operations to (1) support commanding, telemetry and payload processing for five on-orbit satellites; (2) planning and pre-launch preparation for seven upcoming satellite missions, and (3) provide operations expertise for ground system modernization and automation. The current contractor possesses the required experience, as demonstrated on the STEC09 contract: commanding, telemetry and payload support for satellite operations; mission design and pre-launch readiness; and operations support for major upgrades to the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) ground architecture. Additional work in support of automating operations for the Operationally Responsive Space 1 (ORS-1) spacecraft supported by the 3rd Space Experimentation Squadron (3SES) at Schriever AFB, CO is also included in this contract.</p>
<p>The scope of this bridge effort is the same as scope defined by the STEC09 contract. The effort includes (1) on-orbit operations support (e.g., mission planning, contact execution, data analysis and distribution, (2) orbit analysis and anomaly response) for 5 on-orbit satellites; (3) mission design and pre-launch readiness for seven upcoming missions; ground system automation for two on-orbit missions; and (4) operations expertise for upgrades to the MMSOC ground system architecture. This sole source action will result in a contract with pricing requirements to include cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) line items, with an estimated contract value of $9.0M. The sole purpose of this contract is to ensure these critical mission requirements continue uninterrupted.</p>
<p>While this notice of intent is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties (to include small and small disadvantaged businesses) may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information for consideration by the agency. Please keep the responses to 15 one-sided pages or less, with 1-inch margins on all sides and in Times New Roman 12-point font. The applicable NAICS code is 541712 with a corresponding size standard of 1,000 employees. Classification code is &lsquo;R" Professional, Administrative and Management Support Services--R425, Engineering and Technical Services. This announcement constitutes the only notice for this bridge effort.</p>
<p>The incumbent is the only contractor who currently can provide RSC operations support given the unique and highly skilled nature of the effort. At this time, there are no other contractors who are capable of providing these services without incurring an unacceptable delay to on-going operations. As stated previously, competition is expected for the follow-on STEC14 effort. The STEC14 source selection is currently in progress. The Government will post notices regarding that acquisition to FedBizOpps.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission 's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7240-00-NIB-0006<br />Name:		Kit, Cleaning, Bucket and Caddy<br />Description:	Five piece bucket and caddy cleaning kit that includes a four gallon plastic bucket with handle; a plastic storage caddy with handle; an all-purpose scrubber brush; a 20"x23", highly absorbent, shammy cleaning cloth and a utility scrubber brush. UOI is KIT.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7240-00-NIB-0006<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item listed above, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Commission:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than March 9, 2015 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The DEA is not at this time seeking proposals.  The purpose of this RFI is to seek industry information about existing commercially available small audio and video recording systems. This RFI is not seeking information about commercially available small audio and video recording systems which are in the developmental phase.

DEA consistently seeks to obtain information and comments from industry that will provide the agency with insight into market conditions and/or scientific advances that will aid in the refinements of requirements and the formation of an acquisition strategy for audio and video surveillance systems. This RFI is designed to conduct market research to determine the current level of technology and availability of such technology in the current market. DEA is interested in obtaining information related to existing, fully developed, and integrated commercially available small audio and video recording systems technology described in the following sections. Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist DEA in determining the potential level of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability of the Small Business community to fulfill this requirement. However, responses to this RFI are solicited from all interested parties.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a requirement for small audio and video recorders in a variety of distinct configurations and concealments to be used in gathering intelligence information in criminal investigations.  These devices shall be extremely small size, shall have programming capabilities, and long recording time capacity. These recorders shall provide higher quality recordings using a digital format. Additionally, DEA has a requirement for these small audio and video recorders to be monitored via wireless means from distances ranging from line of sight to long haul over a variety of telecommunications systems.


The recorders shall be both small in size and versatility to improve effectiveness of undercover operations. The recorder size shall be no larger than 1.0x 0.8x 0.2. The video body recorder shall record monaural or stereo audio via a microphone level input. Microphones shall  be located internal to the unit. The unit shall also have an optional external stereo microphone with a switch for ON/OFF operation. LEDs are visible for ON/OFF, unit memory FULL, audio signal presence, and video signal presence verification purposes. The video body recorder shall be erase-protected to ensure each and every recorded file is downloaded as evidence prior to erasure. Each and every bit of space on the flash memory chips shall be erased. The recorder shall be capable of capturing XVGA images at 30FPS for 8 hours. Audio and Video transmissions systems shall be small in size so as to be easily concealable in a body worn application or in a covert location in close proximity to the undercover operation. The audio and video transmission system shall be capable of live monitoring of the recorders as this will provide the greatest means of providing officer safety. It is also required that the audio and video transmission system be capable of retrieving files stored on the recorders. The interface between the recorders and transmission systems shall be seamless and require no third party interface such as proprietary viewing software, server hosting services etc.

<DESC>This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The DEA is not at this time seeking proposals.  The purpose of this RFI is to seek industry information about existing commercially available real-time and non- real-time tracking systems. This RFI is not seeking information about commercially available real-time and non- real-time tracking systems which are in the developmental phase.

DEA consistently seeks to obtain information and comments from industry that will provide the agency with insight into market conditions and/or scientific advances that will aid in the refinements of requirements and the formation of an acquisition strategy for tracking technology systems.  This RFI is designed to conduct market research to determine the current level of technology and availability of such technology in the current market. DEA is interested in obtaining information related to existing, fully developed, and integrated commercially available tracking technology that effectively integrates Global Positioning System (GPS), wireless communication systems, and customized mapping and data distribution software. Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist DEA in determining the potential level of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability of the Small Business community to fulfill this requirement. However, responses to this RFI are solicited from all interested parties.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a requirement for a family of real-time and non-real-time tracking equipment to meet the operational requirements of the tracking program currently in operation throughout DEA.  The equipment shall be compatible with the current Centralized Tracking System (CTS) used to monitor and track all DEA assets and investigative targets.  

The tracker shall be self-contained and include all necessary components to install, collect and transmit, via wireless technology, GPS data (latitude, longitude, time, date, and velocity) to a remote tracking terminal station. The ability to remotely command and monitor tracker status shall exist. The tracker shall have as a minimum the following programmable features:  GPS sample rate ( minimum 5 seconds), motion detection, scheduled and unscheduled  callouts (phone, e-mail, pager), Geo-fence (entrance, and exit alarms) and power management (Sleep, Wake on motion, Full on).  

The actual tracking device power specifications shall be DC operated with the following power requirements:  power inputs shall be protected against polarity reversal., internal power regulation shall allow operation from a power source rated between 9VDC and l SVDC, maximum total device current during operation shall not exceed 1OOma. During sleep mode the maximum current shall not exceed 1Oma, 

The maximum physical size shall not exceed 4.7" x 2.8" x 1.75" to include connectors, magnets, mounts, and tie wrap loops and the maximum weight shall not exceed two pounds, excluding batteries.

The tracking devices shall have a built-in capacity to store at least 200,000 GPS records.  Non-volatile memory shall be used to prevent data lost during power outages or operating 
in noncoverage areas. While operating in non-coverage areas, GPS records shall be stored in onboard memory and automatically downloaded once the tracking device is within coverage. Devices that are designed as data loggers shall retain all GPS data records in memory until downloaded.  If  GPS tracking records are stored in a format other than industry standard NEMA, the contractor shall provide the necessary software conversion tools to allow the data to be exported to data analysis programs such as Microsoft Access and/or Excel.  As a minimum, tracking records shall include data fields that record the targets latitude, longitude, time, speed, and block street address. The mapping software as a minimum shall have the capability to perform data search and sorts on these fields.

All tracking devices shall have as a minimum, one (1) input control line that can read the status of a switch (open or closed), and one ( 1) output line that can be remotely commanded to switch a one ( 1) amp load. Switching inputs/outputs are not required on devices that are designed to be used as data loggers.

All tracking devices shall operate in the following environment with no degradation in operational performance:  operating temperature range of -20F to 140F, relative humidity of 5% to 95%, water resistance equivalent to that as sprayed from a garden hose for three (3) minutes, survive a one ( 1) meter drop onto a concrete surface as well as vibrational forces that are associated with the exterior surfaces of a moving vehicle.

All power cables, input/output cables, programming cables, antennas (GPS and Cellular), and documentation necessary to install the tracking device using either the vehicles power source or an external battery source should be provided with each tracking device.  Tracking devices shall operate using commercially available communication protocols and standards. Acceptable wireless communications protocols and standards include: Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM). In addition to conducting real-time tracking in the US, the DEA is seeking solutions that will support its global tracking requirements.  Solutions that employ satellite based communication technologies are acceptable.   All cellular based tracking devices shall have an Internet Protocol (IP) capability in addition to a cellular or radio link point to point capability. The IP capability is required to ensure that tracking devices procured are capable of operating with the DEA Centralized Tracking System (CTS).  A Microsoft Windows compatible mapping software package that allows the tracking device( s) to transfer GPS tracking data and device status to a remote base control tracking terminal shall be prided.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101, this is a notice of intent to award a firm-fixed price sole contract to the O'Gara Group, 7870 East Kemper Road, Cincinnati, OH 45249 for the acquisition of armored ambulances to support the needs of the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS).
<p>This purchase shall fall under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>O'Gara is the manufacturer of the 12 FAM compliant, Level C armored vehicles to be provided as GFP as the solution to the Government need. The U.S. Department of State has previously procured and tested the existing armored vehicles. It is not in the Government's best interest to re-procure and test armored vehicle compliance from an alternative manufacturer as any armored ambulance from a non-Department of State approved vendor must be built, and not procured from standing off-the-shelf inventory. The need to train a new contractor to meet DOS standards for AV is not practicable. Additionally, the processes for armored vehicle testing, manufacturing, and security clearance processing are lengthy. Due to the complexity and magnitude of this requirement, as well as the medical necessity, and the abbreviated timeframe it is not possible to substitute any other contractor services.</p>
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) will not be made available through the GPE; however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying the requirement. To be considered, statements of capability must be received within fifteen (15) calendar days after publication of this notice.  The formal solicitation document (RFP) may then be obtained electronically upon request. No telephone requests will be accepted. All communication shall be sent electronically to Patrick Dermidoff, Contracting Officer at dermidoffpt@state.gov</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR PROVISION 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>I. EVALUATION FOR CONTRACT AWARD: The Government plans to award a single contract resulting from this solicitation IAW FAR 13.106-2 to the responsible offeror whose quote/offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered (Technical and Past Performance).</p>
<p>II. The Government intends to evaluate and award without establishing a competitive range, conducting discussions, and scoring quotations/offers. Therefore, the offeror's initial quote/offer should contain the offeror's best quotation/offer. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, etc. if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>III. Technical: Proposal must clearly demonstrate that the offeror is capable of meeting the performance standards specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) with respect to Certification. Offerors shall submit a copy of all required NFPA 96 standard certifications. (Reference PWS paragraph 1.1)<br /><br />IV. Past Performance:</p>
<p>a. Past Performance will be rated as either "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable" using the ratings and descriptions in the table below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Rating Description</p>
<p>Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />b. May be based on one or more of the following:</p>
<p>i. The Contracting Officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />ii. Customer surveys and past performance questionnaires; <br />iii. The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov; or<br />iv. Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>V. Price:</p>
<p>a. The total evaluated price of a proposal will be calculated as the sum of the extended prices (unit quantity multiplied by unit price) for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs). Prices will be submitted using the format in Attachment 3, Pricing Schedule. The CLIN structure for award purposes is stated above.</p>
<p>b. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for the option year to the total price for the basic requirement. The Option to Extend Services Clause 52.217-8 will also be evaluated for the Offerors proposed prices. The 52.217-8 extension of services will be added/calculated to the offeror's price proposal by utilizing the following formula: monthly price = the monthly price of the last year/CLIN X 6 months. If the option to extend services under 52.217-8 are used, prices are only adjusted if the Secretary of Labor revises the wage rates and the contractor requests an increase due to the change in labor rates. Six month extension period per FAR clause 52.217-8 is used only in circumstances listed in FAR 37.111.</p>
<p>c. The Contracting Officer has determined there is a probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost/price information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of price.<br /><br />VI. LATE SUBMISSIONS, DEBRIEFINGS, AND NOTICE OF AWARD:</p>
<p>a. Hand carried or mailed proposals (USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL, etc.) must be delivered to 5 CONS/LGCS Mon-Fri between the hours of 0730-1630 local time, Attn: Trenton Beavers, 165 Missile Ave, Minot AFB, ND 58705.

<SUBJECT>EHTB Collaboration with Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Epi Center
<SOLNBR>2015-61947SG
<RESPDATE>030515
<CONTACT>Sarah H. Gray, Phone 7704882085, Email Sgray1@cdc.gov
<DESC>Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, NCEH:<br />Statement of Work<br />Project Title: <br />Environmental Health Tracking Branch Collaboration with<br />the Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Epi Center
<p><br />Section 1 - Background</p>
<p>There is a gap in our nation's ability to link environmental hazards and exposures to chronic disease issues because of the way surveillance is conducted and the way surveillance data is stored by our public health and healthcare systems. The Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (Tracking Network) was created to address this public health gap, to provide information to a variety of audiences from a nationwide network of integrated health and environmental data that drives actions to improve health outcomes. Since the Tracking Network launched in 2009, it has continued to evolve in content and functionality. However, the Tracking Network has very limited information specific to American Indians.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Epidemiology Center (GLITEC) assessed environmental health priorities and resources among the 34 Tribes in the Bemidji Area of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. This assessment identified Tribal data that potentially could be added to the Tracking Network. The Environmental Health Tracking Branch has an established relationship with the GLITEC and has worked with the center to assess and begin to plan how disparate data sources can be brought together to link environmental and health outcomes at a Tribal level.</p>
<p><br />Section 2 - Purpose</p>
<p>The goal of the Project is a mechanism by which Tribal data can be submitted to the Tracking Network and explore the application of Tribal data to environmental public health.</p>
<p><br />Section 3 - Scope of Work</p>
<p>Three Tracking Program grantees (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota) have worked with the GLITEC to assist in addressing the environmental public health data gaps of the Bemidji Area. Tribal Populations are missing population-specific data to link environmental exposures to health outcomes. This project would establish a repository of tribal data in the Tracking Network and provide a data source to explore links between environmental and health outcomes at a Tribal level. The project will leverage existing data available within the Bemidji Tribal Territory and does not include the collection of any new data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 4 - Tasks to be Performed</p>
<p>The contractor will meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>A. Identify data sources based on the 2014 assessment of tribal data for the Bemidji Area. <br />B. Identify tribal partners willing to submit data. <br />C. Establish indicators for the priorities identified<br />D. GLITEC would work with CDC to address confidentiality concerns through methods such as temporal aggregation and suppression. <br />E. Work with CDC to develop the content for the tribal pages and to establish the data display. <br />F. Work with CDC and its partners to explore the application of tribal data to environmental public health.<br />G. Build environmental epidemiology capacity within the Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Epi-Center</p>
<p><br />Section 5 - Government Furnished Materials</p>
<p>This contract will not utilize any government furnished property.</p>
<p><br />Section 6 - Period of Performance</p>
<p>This contract is projected to have a period of performance from September 1, 2015 to August 31, 2016.</p>
<p><br />Section 7 - Place of Performance</p>
<p>Performance of activities will take place at the contractor's facility.</p>
<p><br />Section 8 - Deliverable/Reporting Schedule:</p>
<p>The contractor will meet the following project timelines (approximate and open to negotiation based on award date):</p>
<p><br />Deliverable Delivered to Due Date<br />Kickoff Meeting CDC Project manager March 2015<br />Identify Tribal Partners and Data Content to be Submitted CDC Project manager May 2015<br />Work with CDC to Revise Documentation to Incorporate Tribes CDC Project manager June 2015<br />Mid-Year Progress Report CDC Project manager September 2015<br />Participate in Data Submission Call CDC Project Manager September 2015<br />Final report &amp; recommendations CDC Project manager January 2015</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section 9 - Travel</p>
<p>Minimal travel may be needed to meet within Bemidji Area of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p><br />Section 10 - Special Considerations</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 USC 794d) <br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Provisions (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit:<br />(1) Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and<br />(2) Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.<br /><br />Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotation/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility provisions. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access- board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm.<br /><br />The Section 508 standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found at http://508.hhs.gov.<br /><br />Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products and/or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products and/or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government - i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products and/or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.<br /><br />The Applicable provisions of this solicitation are: 1194.21, .22, .31, .41.</p>

<p>SEM will provide SEM Model 1201 CC Green Shredder (Zero Oil), and SEM Model 0202 Green Optical Media Shredder - Oil-less.</p>
<p>Market Research efforts have indicated that SEM is the only manufacturer of "green" oil-less shredders. The SEM Shredders are on the NSA EPL which is required. This BPA is being established to procure the green shredders to support new offices being constructed and the replacement of obsolete/defunct equipment.</p>
<p>SEM is the only source capable of providing the green (oil-less) shredders as they are the only manufacturer of the shredder. Utilization of the brand name shredders guarantees full compliance with the NSA EPL and the existing maintenance agreement the FBI has. Therefore, SEM is the only responsible provider and developer of the green shredders.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B).<br /><br />This is not a request for competitive quotes; however interested sources who believe they can meet the requirements may submit a capability statement no later than February 27, 2015 at 10:00 a.m.&nbsp;to the point of contact for this notice.

Under the direction of the Systems Administrator who is the designated Contracting Officer Representative (COR) for this activity, the contactor shall undertake all tasks as spelt out in the statement of work. The compound has a user community of between 80 - 100 people with area size of approximately 18,000 square meters The contractor shall seek to understand the current cable duct, telco and other carrier infrastructure at the USG RC by carrying out the necessary physical and communications survey at the USG RC where the service is required. The contractor will then come up with options of solutions that will meet USAID South Sudan's requirements. Due to the critical nature of the connection, contractor shall be required to ensure availability and required quality of this service at all times. Any interruptions resulting in lack of service or service degradation below the Internet speed stipulated in this scope of work will result in commensurate loss of the recurrent telecommunications and Internet subscriptions fees. The ISP should ensure timely (within an hour) responses to calls for services in the event that there are breakdowns. The WISP should provide twenty four hour technical coverage of service support and should therefore be operating a 24/7 X 365 support center and advice the Mission on the customization of the usage of the services. That would mean frequent monitoring of the protocols that are very much used and that is made available to USAID Systems Manager. The ISP should provide content and URL filtering to limit Band Width intensive applications. All equipment and tools that are part of the overall devices of the installation should be added in the quotation. The ISP should provide any required hardware, software, IP addresses, and telecommunications applications or software upgrade including any licenses that may be required to keep the service operational after the service has been commissioned. After the service has been commissioned the contractor shall bear any installation costs that may be required to keep the quality of the service acceptable to USAID. Further, the contactor will be responsible for additional costs arising from technical modifications, change of Internet provisioning technologies or change in agreements of the WISP and its partners.<br /><br /><strong>Required Bandwidth.</strong> Minimum uplink speed to North American Internet sites 3.0 mbps (Committed), minimum downlink Speed from North American sites 9.2 mbps (Committed). This service could be offered through any technologies that will meet these requirements. USAID requires 99.97% of Internet availability at all times to meet to meet our business requirements. The ISP should provide adequate redundancy at critical network points and at all other necessary levels so as to ensure un-interruptible IS and smooth operations at all times.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: '11ieh,Bold'">Service Monitoring. </span></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: 75ool">USAID will use various telecommunications tools including commercial web based speed measurement tools to do on the spot Internet speed measurements. The ISP must guarantee full contracted BW availability from the originator side to the ISP's internet gateway.</span></p>

<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78 December 26, 2014</p>
<p>This is a Full and Open Competition acquisition</p>
<p>Quoters should be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is - 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. Small Business Size Standard is $15.0 in millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The period of performance has a base period of 12 months with two (2) 12 month option periods.</p>
<p>This announcement serves to notify contractors that the government contemplates awarding a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation for the services defined herein.</p>
<p>Prospective Quoters are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the Quoter's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></p>
<p>The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a block grant program authorized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of l981, as amended, and is administered within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In HHS, LIHEAP is administered by the Office of Community Services (OCS) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The purpose of LIHEAP is to provide grants to states, territories, Indian tribes and tribal organizations to assist low income households in meeting the costs of residential energy.</p>
<p>The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act of l981 (Title XXVI of Public Law 97-35, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 8621) in section 2609A(a) authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to set aside up to $300,000 each fiscal year to make grants or contracts, to state and public agencies and private non-profit organizations, to provide training and technical assistance relating to LIHEAP. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, overrode P.L. 97-35 and allowed the Secretary (1) to set aside up to $2,988,000; and (2) enter into contracts with private entities that do not qualify as nonprofit organizations. Jointly financed cooperative arrangements may be made with states and public agencies and private nonprofit organizations. <br />In addition, section 2609A(b) of P.L. 97-35 also authorized grants "to one or more private nonprofit organizations that apply jointly with a business concern to receive such grant." This request is also being submitted under the authority of Section 601 of the Economy Act, as amended (31 U.S.C. Sections 1535 and 1536), and Section 1110 of the Social Security Act.</p>
<p>LIHEAP allows states, tribes and territories to develop energy assistance and weatherization programs that best meet the needs of their low income populations. Consequently, LIHEAP programs vary greatly in program design and implementation strategies. It is important for LIHEAP grantees to share their unique programs and innovative ideas so successful and effective policies and practices can be replicated to enhance programs. It is also important for grantees to have access to evaluations and research to help them administer effective programs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope and Requirements</span></p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to create a LIHEAP Clearinghouse which shall be responsible to collect, develop, organize and disseminate information on LIHEAP programs, current energy issues and trends, other low income energy assistance programs, other programs that affect LIHEAP-eligible clients and other relevant information of interest to LIHEAP grantees.</p>
<p>The Clearinghouse will provide technical assistance and information through a dedicated telephone number, a website, a mailing address, electronic newsletters and other written correspondence as needed. Clearinghouse information will be available to OCS, LIHEAP grantees, their sub-contractors and sub-grantees, including other OCS grantees such as Community Actions Agencies, and other interested parties.</p>
<p>The Clearinghouse will also provide a National Energy Assistance Referral (NEAR) Service that refers those in the general public who are interested in applying for LIHEAP to the LIHEAP office or other assistance agencies, as appropriate. The Clearinghouse staff may also be asked to provide technical assistance and training presentations, as needed.</p>
<p>The LIHEAP Clearinghouse serves as a hub for information about the variation among LIHEAP grantees in their programs policies and procedures. It is also a referral network for the public to access information 24/7 about where to apply for assistance.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted using Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Evaluation of proposals will be conducted in accordance with the criteria identified under Section M of the solicitation. Refer to the attached Solicitation for the specific evaluation criteria.</p>

U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) has executed a purchase option, with transfer of ownership scheduled for April 2015. The office building is 10-stories above grade with a basement. The majority of the mechanical equipment is housed in a 3-story structure adjacent to the building. The building has a 10-story parking garage with approximately 850 spaces. &nbsp;The asset is 20 years old and many systems are approaching the end of their useful lives and are inefficient. Upgrades to the building's infrastructure are required to extend the asset's service life, reduce energy consumption and operating expenses, and ensure long-term occupancy of federal tenants.</span></p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200079 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-78 effective 26 December 2014 which incorporates FAC 2005-79 effective 15 December, 2014.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopter Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopter France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET "HSCG38-15-Q-200079 - REQUIREMENTS" FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. <br />Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a Certificate of Conformance and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>
<p>NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>A. The total evaluated price of a proposal will be calculated as the sum of the extended prices (unit quantity multiplied by unit price) for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs). Prices will be submitted using the format in Attachment 3, Pricing Schedule. The CLIN structure for award purposes is stated above.</p>
<p>B. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for the option years to the total price for the basic requirement. The Option to Extend Services Clause, 52.217-8, will also be evaluated using the pricing from the last option year. If the option to extend services under 52.217-8 is used, prices are only adjusted if the Secretary of Labor revises the wage rates and the contractor requests an increase due to the change in labor rates. The six-month extension period per FAR clause 52.217-8 is used only in circumstances listed in FAR 37.111. If option is exercised, a CLIN will be added via modification.</p>
<p>C. The Contracting Officer has determined there is a probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost/price information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of price.<br /><br />VI.

<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR PROVISION 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>I. EVALUATION FOR CONTRACT AWARD: The Government plans to award a single contract resulting from this solicitation IAW FAR 13.106-3 to the responsible offeror whose quote/offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered (Past Performance).</p>
<p>II. The Government intends to evaluate and award without establishing a competitive range, conducting discussions, and scoring quotations/offers. Therefore, the offeror's initial quote/offer should contain the offeror's best quotation/offer. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, etc. if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>III. Past Performance:</p>
<p>A. Past Performance will be rated as either "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable" using the ratings and descriptions in the table below.</p>
<p>Rating Description</p>
<p>Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />B. Past performance may be based on one or more of the following:</p>
<p>i. The Contracting Officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />ii. Customer surveys and past performance questionnaires; <br />iii. The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov; or<br />iv. Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>IV. Price:</p>
<p>A. The total evaluated price of a proposal will be calculated as the sum of the extended prices (unit quantity multiplied by unit price) for all Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs). Prices will be submitted using the format in Attachment 3, Pricing Schedule. The CLIN structure for award purposes is stated above.</p>
<p>B. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for the option years to the total price for the basic requirement. The Option to Extend Services Clause, 52.217-8, will also be evaluated using the pricing from the last option year. If the option to extend services under 52.217-8 is used, prices are only adjusted if the Secretary of Labor revises the wage rates and the contractor requests an increase due to the change in labor rates. The six-month extension period per FAR clause 52.217-8 is used only in circumstances listed in FAR 37.111. If option is exercised, a CLIN will be added via modification.</p>
<p>C. The Contracting Officer has determined there is a probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional cost/price information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of price.<br /><br />V.

<p>Late proposals will be processed in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(f) "Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers." <br />(End of provision)</p>

The due date allows potential offerors just over one additional month to propose solutions in response to the current Ebola topics of concern for the ongoing disease outbreak. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency has received more than one hundred proposals to date and is currently reviewing several promising submissions. The BAA has been a success in identifying a multitude of potential near-term solutions applicable to the current Ebola epidemic. The Ebola crisis in West Africa remains a priority for the DoD and other Government agencies. The BAA will remain in FedBizOpps to provide a mechanism for submission of Phase II proposals. Should the urgent need re-emerge, an announcement could be made to reopen Phase I proposal submission at a future date. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency is continually looking for innovative ideas and solutions to WMD challenges.<br /><br />

The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>      <br>   2. Solicitation W912J3-15-T-E001 for non-personal services is being issued as a Request for Quotation.    <br>      <br>   3.

The Government intends to enter into a BPA for one base year (30 March 2015 to 29 March 2016) with four (4) option years (2020). This time can be shortened at the government's discretion. This BPA will have a period of performance of five (5) years from date of agreement via issuance of Blanket Purchase Agreement Calls. The BPA will be reviewed annually. The BPA Master Dollar Limit shall be $5,000,000.00. Call limits will be $150,000.00    <br>      <br>   4. PHA Requirements: PHA requirements will be per the attached PWS.   <br>      <br>   5.

Variance from the price list should be coordinated with the Purchasing and Contracting office prior to acceptance.   <br>      <br>   7. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses for commercial items in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-79. The intent is to award a 5 year BPA. This acquisition is a 100% set-aside for small businesses. The associated NAICS code for this acquisition is 621999; Small Business Administration size standard is $15.0 Mil. FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999) the following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government needs, (ii) Price, (iii) Past Performance.

<DESC>This amendment attaches the Questions/Answers In Reference to Solicitation Number: VA248-15-Q-0625, Water Sampling Analysis
All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

Questions/Answers In Reference to Solicitation Number: VA248-15-Q-0625, Water Sampling Analysis
Question:  Will the contractor be allowed access to perform all of the Heterotrophic Plate Count samples within the Dental Clinic during one shift, or will the sampling need to be staggered over several days because the Dental Clinic is in constant use during normal working hours?
Answer:  Work in dental can be performed during a single shift
        Question:  Section 2.b.iv states that level of residual biocide will be measured at the time of              sampling in the field.  Section 3.w.b states that oxidant residual samples will be analyzed by ASTM Method D1253-86 in a Florida DOH certified laboratory.  Is this separate testing for   residual oxidant in addition to the residual biocide testing?

Answer:  Section 2 refers to Legionella sampling where residual oxidant, pH, and water temperature measurement is to be performed in the field at the time of sampling.  Section 3 refers to the Dental Water Line sampling and all analysis is performed by the lab.

Question:  The bid requires taking the pH, residual oxidant level, and temperature when sampling for the Legionella sample for the potable water and cooling tower water.   Does this mean that the samples noted in Table #1 for oxidant residual are to be performed in the field along with the other tests, or is this to be a lab test?

Question:  Table #3 notes supplemental testing to be quoted for 50 samples each.  Is the temperature, pH, and oxidant level to be performed in the field when the samples are taken or are these tests to be performed in the lab?

If these are to be lab tests, then does that mean that the pH, oxidant residual, and temperature performed in the field are to be redundant since the same tests are to be performed in the lab?
Answer:  Any of the Legionella related samples need to have the temperature, residual oxidant, and pH taken in the field at the time of sampling.  They don't need to be repeated at the lab.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   <br>      <br>   All quotes submitted will be evaluated for Technical Acceptability, Satisfactory Past Performance & Price.  The government will issue award to the offeror whose proposal is the Lowest Price of those determined to meet at least the minimum requirements to be determined Technically Acceptable & Demonstrates Satisfactory Past Performance.     <br>      <br>   (1) Technical Acceptability; is defined as the documented capability to meet the minimum requirements of the project specifications as defined in this solicitation and the attached scope-of-work.   <br>       <br>   (A) Offerors shall submit with their proposal package a project completion timeline/schedule including proposed progress milestones for the specified scope-of-work.    <br>      <br>    (2) Satisfactory Past Performance; to demonstrate satisfactory past performance the offeror shall submit documentation of satisfactory performance on past or current contracts involving contracts of a similar type, size, scope, and complexity, as well as, provide references, including names and contact information of references who can verify such past performance.  Past performance information of key personnel and crew may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be evaluated as neutral on Past Performance, providing the offeror supplies a certified statement with their offer that no past performance information is available.     <br>      <br>   The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance as well as data obtained from other sources available  i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating satisfactory past performance rests with the offeror.      <br>      <br>   It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient documentation and information for the Government to determine technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance, and proposed price.  Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine technical acceptability, past performance, or price may be cause for rejection of your quote.     <br>      <br>      <br>   (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).   <br>      <br>   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.   <br>      <br>   (End of Provision)   <br>      <br>      <br>   52.212-4 	CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2014)   <br>      <br>   (a) Inspection/Acceptance.

The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights -   <br>      <br>   (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and   <br>      <br>   (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.   <br>      <br>   (b) Assignment.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an  quote mark I agree quote mark  click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g.,  quote mark click-wrap quote mark  or  quote mark browse-wrap quote mark  agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.   <br>      <br>   (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.   <br>      <br>   (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.   <br>      <br>   (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.   <br>      <br>   (End of Clause)   <br>

The government will issue award to the offeror whose proposal is the Lowest Price of those determined to meet at least the minimum requirements to be determined Technically Acceptable & Demonstrates Satisfactory Past Performance.      <br>        <br>    (1) Technical Acceptability; is defined as the documented capability to meet the minimum requirements of the project specifications as defined in this solicitation and the attached scope-of-work.    <br>         <br>    (A) Offerors shall submit with their proposal package a project completion timeline/schedule including proposed progress milestones for the specified scope-of-work.     <br>        <br>     (2) Satisfactory Past Performance; to demonstrate satisfactory past performance the offeror shall submit documentation of satisfactory performance on past or current contracts involving contracts of a similar type, size, scope, and complexity, as well as, provide references, including names and contact information of references who can verify such past performance.  Past performance information of key personnel and crew may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be evaluated as neutral on Past Performance, providing the offeror supplies a certified statement with their offer that no past performance information is available.      <br>        <br>    The Government's approach to evaluating past performance is to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance as well as data obtained from other sources available  i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating satisfactory past performance rests with the offeror.       <br>        <br>    It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient documentation and information for the Government to determine technical acceptability, satisfactory past performance, and proposed price.  Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine technical acceptability, past performance, or price may be cause for rejection of your quote.      <br>        <br>        <br>    (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).    <br>        <br>    (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.    <br>        <br>    (End of Provision)    <br>        <br>        <br>    52.212-4 	CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2014)    <br>        <br>    (a) Inspection/Acceptance.

If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights -    <br>        <br>    (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and    <br>        <br>    (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.    <br>        <br>    (b) Assignment.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an  quote mark I agree quote mark  click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g.,  quote mark click-wrap quote mark  or  quote mark browse-wrap quote mark  agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.    <br>        <br>    (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.    <br>        <br>    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.    <br>        <br>    (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.    <br>        <br>    (End of Clause)    <br>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Contractor must adhere to the provisions of Public Law 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and the National Standards to Protect the Privacy and Security of Protected Health Information (PHI). As required by HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has promulgated rules governing the security and use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA Central Office, Washington DC, has determined medical services provided under Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) do not require a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) from contractors providing healthcare services on VA's behalf. The ADHC meal service benefits qualify as a healthcare service, therefore no BAA is required.

AMENDMENT#: A00004

The purpose of this amendment is to do the following: 
1.	To provide the answers to the following questions received from interested offerors:

Questions received:
Question 7: All of our medical personnel are Independent Contractors.  Do they have to be employees of ours?
Answer 7: No. However, they are considered as your subcontractors.

Question 8: Being they are Independent Contractors, do we have to have Workers' Compensation Insurance for them?
Answer 8: Again these Independent Contractors are your subcontractors, and as such there is no privity of contract between the Government and subcontractors of prime contractors. As a result, you will be required to procure the insurance that is required by the prime contract, which is the contract between your firm/company and the Government provided your company is awarded a contract. The Government does not provide legal advice to vendors/contractors; please consult your legal department.

Question 9: As we are a medical staffing agency, can we submit a bid and are we eligible to submit a candidate for these services?
Answer 9: Your Company can submit a bid as long as it is registered as a small business for NAICS code 561320 in SAM.gov since this requirement is a total small business set-aside under NAICS code 561320. If your company is registered within SAM.gov under NAICS code 561320 as a small business you can go ahead and submit candidate resumes for consideration to fulfil this requirement.

Question 10: Is the unit cost by the hour?
Answer 10: Please refer to the CLIN structure within Attachment A - Price/Cost Schedule for the units of issue for each CLIN (Contract Line Item Number).

2.	All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>I.  INTRODUCTION:  <br>    <br>  This is a Request for Information (RFI), as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  <br>    <br>  The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff Installation Management (OACSIM) Army Environmental Division (ISE), Installation Services Directorate is seeking information on an enterprise resource planning (ERP) commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) SAP-based environmental data to provide Helpdesk and Long-term Sustainment services to support HQAES services.  This Request for Information (RFI) is for contract holders currently registered under the NAICS code 541512, Computer System Design Services, with a size standard of $27.5 million.  Additionally, the scope includes Special Item Number (SIN) 132 51 Information Technology (IT) Professional Services, which includes system design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing, programming, conversion, implementation, and other relevant services of an ERP software package from a SAP Army data environment.    <br>    <br>  II. PURPOSE:  <br>    <br>  The purpose of this RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Information received in response to this RFI shall be safeguarded adequately from unauthorized disclosure.  This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or an invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an eventual acquisition approach.  This RFI does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation.  Neither unsolicited proposal nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this request or accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Contractors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with participating in this RFI.  Acknowledgement of receipt of submitted items will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the information received.  Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to determine the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability unrestricted to the small and large business community for providing the required services.    <br>    <br> The Army plans to implement best practices, to improve productivity, gain efficiencies, and realize cost savings in consideration of industry recommendations in the delivery of the HQAES.  <br>    <br>  III. BACKGROUND:  <br>    <br>  The Army Environmental Program (AEP) mission is to sustain the environment to enable the Army's mission and secure the future. The goal is to improve readiness by helping to provide and ensure continued access to quality training lands and facilities with minimal restrictions on operations. The Army chose an enterprise resource planning (ERP) commercial off the shelf (COTS) software package from SAP as the enterprise solution for Army environmental data management collection and reporting. This COTS software package has been customized to fit Army environmental business processes.  The current execution contract will tentatively expire in Sep 2015, however it is anticipated that there will be a three-six month extension to allow for transition. The services discussed herein are planned to be part of the overarching ERP services acquisition which will support HQAES.  Because HQAES has an imminent need for support services this RFI is being published while the Army continues to formulate the overarching strategy.  <br>    <br>  To continue business process transformation, IT solutions supporting the AEP must be modernized to align with new business processes. Key areas for transformation include: establishing a capability to comply with environmental liability reporting requirements, monitoring and reporting on the performance of the AEP, and conducting program analysis to optimize environmental cleanup and environmental quality activities.  <br>    <br>  III. HQAES OVERVIEW:  <br>    <br>  A.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY for an airbag system that is capable of meeting the basic requirements described below.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB).  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources for planning purposes only.  Responses to this notice are not considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information.       <br>          <br> DESCRIPTION:     <br>          <br> The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA is seeking a domestic source for energy dissipating airbags, to be used with a specific cargo aerial delivery platform, for test and evaluation.      <br>          <br> The U.S. Army has recently proven the concept of modifying the United Kingdom's Medium Stressed Platform (MSP) to function with U.S. C-130J aircraft.  The platform uses airbags integrated into the structure to dissipate impact energy upon touchdown in lieu of energy dissipating material (EDM, aka honeycomb) currently used by the U.S.  The concept of using airbags instead of honeycomb is believed to benefit the U.S. Army by reducing impact forces to cargo, thus improving cargo survivability.     <br>          <br> REQUIREMENTS:     <br>          <br> The desired airbag design should consist of a cylinder made of impermeable fabric, sandwiched between two mattress boards, with a one-way valve on the bottom and an orifice on the top.  See the attached file 'Airbag Assembly.pdf'  for a picture representing the desired airbag configuration.  The impermeable fabric cylinder shall be collapsible for storage and expandable during deployment.  The cylinder will most likely be reinforced with wire or flexible rod to improve the hoop strength.  The mattress boards shall be made from 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch plywood or similar and are attached to the cylinder with ties or other type of replaceable fasteners.  The bottom board shall be furnished with a one-way valve through which the airbag is inflated by ram air during descent, much the same way a parachute is inflated.  The top board shall be furnished with a sacrificial patch that covers the orifice.  Upon platform touchdown, the airbag is compressed, increasing the air pressure, causing the sacrificial patch to burst.  During compression the orifice controls the air flow exiting the cylinder, slowing down the load to the ground.       <br>          <br> The platform to which the airbags will interface is the United Kingdom's (UK) Medium Stressed Platform (MSP).  See the attached file 'MSP Assembly.pdf' for an illustration of the platform. The MSP is constructed of three longitudinal channels (one channel on each side and one center channel) and twenty-three (23) transverse channels.  The top of the transverse channels provide the surface to which the cargo load is secured.  The airbags are located beneath the transverse channels, between the longitudinal channels.  The top mattress boards of the airbags run along the ledges of the longitudinal channels and are tied in place.  The bottom mattress boards are held in place by the platform's skid doors.  Between the two side channels and the center channel are two slots that accept the airbag assemblies.  Each slot holds up to six (6) airbags, for a total availability of twelve (12) airbags.       <br>          <br> OTHER REQUIREMENTS:     <br>     - Textile materials used for airbag construction must meet the requirements of the Berry Amendment, 10 USC 2533a.      <br>     - The MSP has an all up weight (AUW) range of 6,000 to 18,000 lbs.       <br>     - See the attached file 'Airbags Deployed Live Drop.jpg' for a photo of the MSP, under canopy, descending towards the ground with airbags fully deployed.     <br>     - It is anticipated an Industry Day will be held at Fort Bragg, NC during 18-19 Mar 2015, to examine and document the airbag system.  Invites to this event will be based on responses received from this RFI.  Vendors are asked to keep that date available should this event occur.  A submission to this RFI does not guarantee an invitation to the event.       <br>      <br> TO ACCESS ATTACHMENTS and Questions and Answers, scroll down to the section titled 'Additional Info' and click on the 'Additional documentation' link.   <br>          <br> REQUESTED INFORMATION:     <br>          <br> Vendors who believe they have the ability to develop product(s) capable of meeting the above requirements are requested to submit a short (no more than five (5) pages total) summary.  The summary should include a description of the vendor's ability to develop an airbag meeting the requirements and characteristics described above, source materials intended to be used, and prototype delivery estimates, as well as pictures, website, and test report(s), as applicable.  The five (5) page summary must include Company name and address, point of contact with phone number, DUNS number, Cage Code and a statement regarding any small business designation (if applicable), by the date and to the address noted below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 314999 - All other miscellaneous textile product mills and the small business size is 500 employees.     <br>          <br> Any information submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the Government for such information. Responses to this notice are to be sent to the RFI POC below. This notice is for market survey only. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement.      <br>          <br> POINT OF CONTACT (POC)     <br>          <br> Interested parties shall submit responses to this RFI to:     <br>          <br>     Jean Greenwood      <br>     Phone:  (508) 233-6101      <br>     Email: jean.t.greenwood.civ@mail.mil     <br>          <br> Questions concerning this RFI may be addressed by contacting:      <br>          <br>     Jean Greenwood      <br>     Phone:  (508) 233-6101      <br>     Email: jean.t.greenwood.civ@mail.mil     <br>          <br> Responses shall be received no later than 4:00PM EDT 9 March 2015.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY for an airbag system that is capable of meeting the basic requirements described below.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB).  It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources for planning purposes only.  Responses to this notice are not considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information.        <br>            <br>  DESCRIPTION:      <br>            <br>  The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA is seeking a domestic source for energy dissipating airbags, to be used with a specific cargo aerial delivery platform, for test and evaluation.       <br>            <br>  The U.S. Army has recently proven the concept of modifying the United Kingdom's Medium Stressed Platform (MSP) to function with U.S. C-130J aircraft.  The platform uses airbags integrated into the structure to dissipate impact energy upon touchdown in lieu of energy dissipating material (EDM, aka honeycomb) currently used by the U.S.  The concept of using airbags instead of honeycomb is believed to benefit the U.S. Army by reducing impact forces to cargo, thus improving cargo survivability.      <br>            <br>  REQUIREMENTS:      <br>            <br>  The desired airbag design should consist of a cylinder made of impermeable fabric, sandwiched between two mattress boards, with a one-way valve on the bottom and an orifice on the top.  See the attached file 'Airbag Assembly.pdf'  for a picture representing the desired airbag configuration.  The impermeable fabric cylinder shall be collapsible for storage and expandable during deployment.  The cylinder will most likely be reinforced with wire or flexible rod to improve the hoop strength.  The mattress boards shall be made from 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch plywood or similar and are attached to the cylinder with ties or other type of replaceable fasteners.  The bottom board shall be furnished with a one-way valve through which the airbag is inflated by ram air during descent, much the same way a parachute is inflated.  The top board shall be furnished with a sacrificial patch that covers the orifice.  Upon platform touchdown, the airbag is compressed, increasing the air pressure, causing the sacrificial patch to burst.  During compression the orifice controls the air flow exiting the cylinder, slowing down the load to the ground.        <br>            <br>  The platform to which the airbags will interface is the United Kingdom's (UK) Medium Stressed Platform (MSP).  See the attached file 'MSP Assembly.pdf' for an illustration of the platform. The MSP is constructed of three longitudinal channels (one channel on each side and one center channel) and twenty-three (23) transverse channels.  The top of the transverse channels provide the surface to which the cargo load is secured.  The airbags are located beneath the transverse channels, between the longitudinal channels.  The top mattress boards of the airbags run along the ledges of the longitudinal channels and are tied in place.  The bottom mattress boards are held in place by the platform's skid doors.  Between the two side channels and the center channel are two slots that accept the airbag assemblies.  Each slot holds up to six (6) airbags, for a total availability of twelve (12) airbags.        <br>            <br>  OTHER REQUIREMENTS:      <br>      - Textile materials used for airbag construction must meet the requirements of the Berry Amendment, 10 USC 2533a.       <br>      - The MSP has an all up weight (AUW) range of 6,000 to 18,000 lbs.        <br>      - See the attached file 'Airbags Deployed Live Drop.jpg' for a photo of the MSP, under canopy, descending towards the ground with airbags fully deployed.      <br>      - It is anticipated an Industry Day will be held at Fort Bragg, NC during 18-19 Mar 2015, to examine and document the airbag system.  Invites to this event will be based on responses received from this RFI.  Vendors are asked to keep that date available should this event occur.  A submission to this RFI does not guarantee an invitation to the event.        <br>        <br>  TO ACCESS ATTACHMENTS and Questions and Answers, scroll down to the section titled 'Additional Info' and click on the 'Additional documentation' link.    <br>            <br>  REQUESTED INFORMATION:      <br>            <br>  Vendors who believe they have the ability to develop product(s) capable of meeting the above requirements are requested to submit a short (no more than five (5) pages total) summary.  The summary should include a description of the vendor's ability to develop an airbag meeting the requirements and characteristics described above, source materials intended to be used, and prototype delivery estimates, as well as pictures, website, and test report(s), as applicable.  The five (5) page summary must include Company name and address, point of contact with phone number, DUNS number, Cage Code and a statement regarding any small business designation (if applicable), by the date and to the address noted below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 314999 - All other miscellaneous textile product mills and the small business size is 500 employees.      <br>            <br>  Any information submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the Government for such information. Responses to this notice are to be sent to the RFI POC below. This notice is for market survey only. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.

<DESC>The Purpose of this amendment is to post vendor questions and answers, in response to the posted solicitation, for all interested offerors.
Q:  Would the 2 day NEPA Application & Management Process class be an introductory or advanced NEPA class? Would it assume that the attendees all have a basic grasp of the NEPA process and that it would simply provide advanced subject matter, or does it assume that we would need to introduce the entire NEPA process beginning with a basic overview?
A:  The Application of NEPA session should assume attendees do not have even a basic ( much less advanced) understanding of NEPA.
As per the Statement of Work, the listed topics under that session include introductions to what NEPA is.    
Additionally, the contractor must have substantial experience customizing training for specific federal agency NEPA implementing regulations and integrating the NEPA process with land and natural resource planning.  
The question due date, regarding this requirement, was posted as NLT 0800 PST, Monday, February 23, 2015 in writing (email) to Heidi.Weber@rl.doe.gov.
This is a Total Small Business Set Aside.

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;">NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA)</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">20 February 2015</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT MODIFICATION</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract modification to contract DG133E-09-CN-0094 GOES-R Ground Segment under the statutory authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized and involve the continuing development of a major system and award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>The Government conducted extensive market research leading up to development of its acquisition plan when this requirement was originally solicited in 2008. Although this market research indicated that there was interest in the requirement from more than one contractor, two proposals were received and the contract was awarded on a best value basis.  Due to the continuing development and transition to operations of the major system, the government has determined that the incumbent contractor is the only source that can provide the immediate services for the current critical mission.</p>
<p>This sole source contract modification will allow the incumbent, Harris Corporation, to provide continuing mission support of the Geostationary Orbital Environmental Satellite-Series R (GOES-R) Core Ground System. The existing contract will not expire until 31 May 2019, however, the project has experienced cost growth and overruns and in order to ensure future changes are considered, it has been determined that the contract ceiling needs to be increased by approximately $250M. The current contractor possesses the required experience and technical knowledge based on developing the GOES-R Core Ground System and providing services in support of integration, test, and pre-launch activities.  Increasing the ceiling under this contract will ensure that the incumbent continues to provide these services through launch and transition to operations which is essential to overall mission success. No other contractor currently has the required GOES-R specific experience necessary to ensure continuation of providing critical services to NOAA in accomplishment of the GOES-R mission.</p>
<p>The effort includes continuing developmental work and services associated with supporting full system integration of the Core Ground System with the satellite both pre and post-launch as well as transition to operations. This contract modification will result in increasing the ceiling of the existing cost-plus-award fee (CPAF) contract to a total of approximately $1.286B.  The sole purpose of this contract modification is to ensure these critical mission requirements continue.</p>
<p>While this notice of intent is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties (to include small and small disadvantaged businesses) may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information for consideration by the agency for future requirements only. Please keep the responses to 15 one-sided pages or less. The applicable NAICS code is 541512 for Computer System Design Services with a corresponding size standard of $27.5M. The Classification Code is "A" Research and Development. This announcement constitutes the only notice for this carry-over effort.</p>
<p>The incumbent is the only contractor who currently can provide GOES-R Core Ground System supports support given the unique and highly skilled nature of the effort. At this time, there are no other contractors who are capable of providing these services without incurring an unacceptable delay to on-going operations.</p>

<DESC>The Electronic Combat Simulation and Evaluation Laboratory (ECSEL) at the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), Point Mugu, CA intends to procure, on an other than full and open competition basis from AAI Corporation, 124 Industry LN, Hunt Valley, MD., 21030-3342, a five year, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for the production of EW SITE systems comprised of the following components: Stimulus Cabinet, Synthetic Source Instruments, and Maintenance/Alignment Cabinet. The contract will also provide sub-system components for domestic and FMS customers. This procurement will result in expanded capabilities and allow the ECSEL to continue to efficiently develop and test current and future EW systems and capabilities in support of aircraft platform integration and test. EW SITE system supports System Configuration Sets (SCS)'s from multiple platforms and provides consistency with the Advanced Weapons Laboratory at China Lake, CA. This contract will also provide incidental services for on-call maintenance, repair and system upgrades, including replacement parts for existing systems as well as the newly acquired systems. Incidental services provided under this contract include: maintenance, training, upgrades, and repairs. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only AAI Corporation is the sole developer and manufacturer of the existing EW SITE system that possesses the unique capability and expertise that can satisfy the minimum needs of the Government. Compatibility with the existing system is required to enable sharing of hardware components between existing threat simulators and leveraging of existing government-developed threat scenario software. The EW SITE systems being procured require the same threat radar file generation capability as the existing simulator. The EW SITE is the only system that performs all three types of Angle of Arrival generation, and has sufficient resolution to generate threats required for systems performing Specific Emitter Identification (SEI). AAI Corporation manufactures the only model of RF synthesizer compatible with the EW SITE system Radio Frequency threat simulator.

As an integral part of this security effort, the contractor shall provide and maintain all management, supervision, manpower, training, equipment, supplies, licenses, permits, certificates, insurance, pre-employment screenings, reports, and files necessary to accomplish the requirement.&nbsp; <br /><br />This requirement is being solicited as a commercial item acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 12. It is anticipated that a single award, fixed price, indefinite quantity, indefinite delivery type contract will be established as a result of the solicitation. The contract will consist of a five year ordering period and a six month optional ordering period pursuant to FAR 52.217-8. <br /><br />The NAICS code is 561612, Security Guard and Patrol Services. The size standard is $20.5 million.<br /><br />The RFP shall require the submission of a technical proposal, as well as a price proposal.

The aim of this RFI is to continue dialogue with Industry in order to support your preliminary planning and aid in the improvement of the solicitation. Therefore, formal proposal responses are not requested from offerors at this time. The Government requests interested parties to send their feedback, including comments and questions, using the provided Excel template, electronically to PIADC-CWSP@hq.dhs.gov. Verbal responses will not be accepted. Comments and questions received within 30 days of the issuance of this RFI will be considered in the development of the final draft SOW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"></strong></span></span></p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> Notice of Award <br> Date:  23 Feb 2015 <br> North American Industrial Classification Standard:  541519 - Other Computer Related Services <br> Contracting Office:  NGB Headquarters, 111 S. George Mason Dr, Arlington, VA  22204-1373 <br> RFQ/Solicitation # W9133L-14-P-1RFI <br>  <br> Point of Contact:  Derrell Wright at derrell.k.wright.civ@mail.mil  <br> RFI Closing and Response Date - 24 April 2014 <br>  <br> The National Guard Bureau (NGB) Contracting Office intends to award to and procure from Micro Focus, Inc., under the authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (d) (1) a subscription of the Micro Focus ACUCOBOL with support and maintenance.   Micro Focus, Inc. provides ACUCOBOL-GT software support and maintenance that supports 54 States and Territories.  Micro Focus, Inc provides a proprietary software capability that enables the National Guard to provide Runtime and Developmental software support (consisting of: HP Itanium running HP UX 11.23i v2 64 Bit, Version 8.0), to 54 States and Territories. This is support for one year with no option periods.  The purchase will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures as authorized by FAR 13.106-1 (b), soliciting from a single source.   <br>  <br> Market research has established Micro Focus, Inc as the sole proprietary provider of ACUCOBOL software support and maintenance. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to meet this requirement.  The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct future competitive procurements. <br>  <br> Rationale:  <br>  <br> The National Guard Bureau has been utilizing ACCUCOBOL-GT, which comprises 40% of the AFCOS/JUSTIS application since 2002 which is used by NGB financial service, such as Stanfins, States Accounting Budgeting System (SABS), Order system, budgeting, and Soldiers pay. NGB is purchasing ACUCOBOL-GT License and Maintenance Support (Micro Focus Support); ACUCOBOL-GT Runtime is necessary for the continued operation of AFCOS/JUSTIS; this is a critical application that is used extensively by the Army National Guard. Without maintaining ACUCOBOL the AFCOS/JUSTIS application in NGB will not be able to sustain operations. AFCOS/JUSTIS is the system that is used to provide financial services to ARNG Soldiers. ARNG-IMS-E will provide ACUCOBL-GT software support and maintenance for the National Guard Bureau to continue supporting the current ACUCOBOL-GT infrastructure within the 54 states and territories. ARNG-IMS-E wishes to procure support and maintenance with the current vendor as well as develop any other vendors (authorized Micro Focus Software provider) to ensure no lapse in current and future capability requirements. The support and maintenance will be procured as Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA).   <br>  <br> Response:  <br>  <br> Please send any responses to this notice to Derrell Wright at the office identified above, or by e-mail to derrell.k.wright.civ@mail.mil.  Responses must be received NLT 4 March 2015 @ 1300 hrs Eastern Standard Time to be reviewed by the Government.  Any responses arriving after the aforementioned suspense will not be reviewed by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete future requirements will be based upon responses to this notice and solely within the discretion of the Government. <br>  <br> FOB:  Destination for delivery to:  National Guard Bureau Headquarters, 111 S. George Mason Drive, Arlington, VA   <br> 22204-1373 <br>  <br>

<DESC>This IDIQ is entitled "Youth Power:  Implementation," and the Task Order is entitled "Task Order 1" under the aforementioned IDIQ.
<p>The objective of the Youth Power: Implementation project is to strengthen local, national, and global youth systems to achieve sustainable, positive youth outcomes in health, education, and political and economic empowerment and to increase youth engagement in development efforts. The statement of work defines youth as those aged 10-29.  This project's focus on strengthening youth systems across many sectors using state-of the-art positive youth development principles is highly anticipated by missions and USAID cooperating countries as these will be the first USAID contracts issued with capacity to bring promising practices in cross-sectoral youth development to scale.   The Bureau of Global Health is the lead for the procurement of YouthPower and E3 and DCHA are USAID partner bureaus.  This solicitation includes the Youth Power:  Implementation Task Order 1 as well.  This TO will have a separate FBO synopsis when awarded.</p>
<p>This solicitation also includes the Youth Power: Evidence and Evaluation (E&amp;E) IDIQ and Task Order 1.  A combined solicitation was issued for the two Youth Power requirements due to the complimentary activities.  An FBO synopsis will be posted when the Youth Power:  E&amp;E IDIQ and Task Order 1 are awarded.</p>

B.3  STATEMENT OF WORK

HOSPITALIST (CLIN 0001)

1.  GENERAL:  Physician, board certified or board eligible in Internal Medicine or Family Medicine is required for coverage of inpatient hospitalist services at the Fargo Veterans Administration Health Care System. Inpatient experience within the last two years is preferred.  

2.  SCOPE:  Work in daytime will involve rounding on inpatients, and providing internal medicine consults on non-medicine patients. Hospitalists also respond to code situations.
