<p>It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<br />Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable.

<DESC>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of autonomous molecular design to accelerate the discovery, validation and optimization of new, high-performance molecules for Department of Defense (DoD) needs. Specifically, DARPA seeks to develop new, systematic approaches that increase the pace of discovery and optimization of high-performance molecules through development of closed-loop systems that exploit, build and integrate tools for: 1) extracting existing data from databases and text; 2) executing autonomous experimental measurement and optimization; and 3) incorporating computational approaches to develop physics-based representations and predictive tools. Such methods will ultimately enable AI-based design and discovery of completely new molecules that are optimized across multiple molecular properties for specific DoD applications. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, and systems related to small organic molecules. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

The services under this effort will provide physical movement of all work-in-process throughout the facility as it undergoes repair, as well as movement of all parts and materials supporting repair operations. The "internal logistics" support provided under this contract is critical to continued operation of FRC East, as mission workload repairs to aircraft, engines and components cannot be completed unless transportation of work-in-process, including the parts and materials necessary to effect repairs, is effectively accomplished under this planned contract. All production lines throughout the facility would shut-down very quickly in the absence of this support.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS<br />See Attachment 1, Draft Solicitation Section B (base year only) and Section C - Performance Work Statement (PWS).<br />The contractor shall provide the following support at the Government site (100%). All tasks are fully defined in the PWS.</p>

<p>-Mule Service for movement of wagon-load items (work-in-process, parts, supplies, Ground Support Equipment, material, etc.) via tow tractors</p>
<p>-Forklift Services for movement of palletized or containerized (etc.) items</p>
<p>-Delivery/Tractor Trailer Services for truckload movement of items both within the facility as well as "over-the-road" (within a geographical area defined in the PWS) for pick-up and delivery of component workload and other special pick-ups or deliveries</p>
<p>-Special Transportation Services by driving car, van or bus in order to transport VIP visitors or FRC East employees with physical disabilities throughout the facility during official facility tours</p>
<p>-Dispatch Services by receiving telephone/computer/walk-in requests for above services and radio<br />dispatching/logging in the dispatch system</p>
<p>-Minor Equipment Maintenance and Administrative Services</p>

The Contractor personnel shall comply with the FRC East's ISO registered Integrated Management Systems (IMS) in performance of their duties.<br />The basis for award of the resultant contract will be best value, lowest priced technically acceptable to the Government.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The anticipated start date is 01 April 2019. It is anticipated that there will be a base period with four, one-year options periods.</p>

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing/repair knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition/repair of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights,manufacturing/repair knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

<DESC><p>The proposed topic will explore and exploit the technical opportunities for discovery and invention in the area of Electronic Warfare (EW). The goal of EW is to control the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) by exploiting, deceiving, or denying enemy use of the spectrum while ensuring its use by friendly forces. To that end, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) EW Discovery and Invention (D&amp;I) program invests in Science and Technology (S&amp;T) initiatives that will provide naval forces (including Navy and Marine Corps) with improved threat warning systems; Electronic warfare Support (ES); decoys and countermeasures against weapon tracking and guidance systems; Electronic Attack (EA) against adversary Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Electronic Protection (EP) of our own weapons and C4ISR from intentional and unintentional interference.</p>
<p>ONR Code 312 Electronic Warfare (312EW) seeks proposals to develop and demonstrate technologies for the next generation systems in electronic warfare. White papers and subsequent proposals should address technology developments in one or more of the following Research Opportunity Technical Areas (TA) 1-4.</p>

<p>Task orders issued under this contract will include Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under these task orders are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires the A/E firm and all consultants to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the contract.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process, or completion of work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hard copies, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.</p>
<p>REASONABLE CARE:</p>
<p>&bull;1.    Limiting Dissemination to Authorized Users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.   <br />&bull;2.   Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.<br />&bull;3.   Written Agreement of Disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process, or completion of work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hard copies, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.  The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents, and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.</p>

<p>2.3 Definitions</p>
<p>Mobilization and Demobilization: For the purposes of this contract, mobilization and demobilization will be defined as the movement of equipment and/or personnel, portal to portal, to an area outside the normal base of operations.<br />Normal Bases of Operation: The following are the designated normal bases of operation: <br />Zone A: Norfolk, Virginia and Mayport, Florida<br />Zone B: San Diego, California; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Yokosuka, Japan, and the contractor proposed base in<br />Singapore.<br />Zone C: The contractor's proposed base(s) on the Arabian Peninsula, Gibraltar, and Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Twenty-four (24) Hour Response Time:<br />(a) For those areas not subject to mobilization and demobilization charges (specified in Task 21; excluding Bahrain), the contractor shall commence performance of waterborne hull cleaning and/or associated work (excluding Tasks 12 and 17) within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of a TO from MSC. For work performed under Tasks 12 and 17, the contractor shall commence mobilization of personnel and equipment within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of a TO from MSC.<br />(b) For those areas subject to mobilization and demobilization charges and in Bahrain the contractor shall commence mobilization of personnel and equipment within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of a TO from MSC.</p>
<p>Operation: It is the Government's intention to optimize all available assets to support a hull cleaning and/or associated work operation. An operation is defined as all work performed on a single hull, between the time the contractor sets equipment alongside the ship and removes all equipment. At a minimum, the contractor shall mobilize sufficient equipment to accomplish the full hull cleaning, interim cleaning, hydro blasting, inspections, documentation (photographic and video), and minor repairs (excluding non-destructive equipment) during a single operation. For work in Singapore, Kingdom of Bahrain and Souda Bay, Greece, the contractor will not be required to include multi-brush cleaning systems in its initial mobilization of equipment to the operation. In the event the Government elects to perform a full hull cleaning with multi-brush equipment a separate mobilization of additional equipment will be authorized.</p>
<p>Normal Work Week: For the purposes of this contract, a normal work week is defined as five consecutive work days; Monday through Friday for United States and for worldwide operations with the exception of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates for which the normal work week is defined as five consecutive work days; Sunday through Thursday.</p>
<p>Normal Work Day: For the purpose of this contract, a normal workday is defined as eight (8) hours per day and commences when the entire crew and equipment arrive at the port facility.</p>
<p>Tasks 06 through 12 are hourly rates, which shall equate to sixty minutes of working dive time. The first 30 minutes of the operational day may be allocated to equipment setup and the crew's dive briefing. The last 15 minutes of the operational day may be allocated to equipment breakdown and de-briefing.</p>
<p>Level I Inspection: Level I Inspections are non-invasive inspections of the entire hull and its appendages. Level I Inspections are typically routine, scheduled inspections. These inspections may be performed for regularly scheduled maintenance assessment, post-deployment condition assessment, or damage assessment following a collision, grounding, or other suspected mishap.</p>
<p>Level 2 Inspection: Level 2 Inspections are system-specific, non-invasive inspections. Level 2 Inspections usually result from either a deficiency discovered during a Level I Inspection or from a problem reported by the ship.</p>
<p>Holidays: When requested by the Government, performance may occur on Federal Holidays and additional compensation may be applicable under the Premium Time (Task 18). For work performed in the United States, holiday shall be defined as the ten Federal holidays established by the Office of Personnel Management. For work outside of the United States, holiday shall be defined as those holidays established by national law in the zone and region in which the work is being performed. For U.S. Citizens performing work outside of the United States will be compensated under Task 18 for United States Federal holidays and those holidays established by national law in the zone and region in which the work is being performed.</p>
<p>Operational Time: For the purposes of this contract, operational time is defined as an interval of time (e.g., hour). The number of personnel, crews, equipment, and types of task has no impact on the unit of operational time.</p>
<p>Stand Alone: Work performed as a discrete task with no other work associated with the operation.</p>
<p>In-Conjunction: Work performed simultaneously or concurrently with additional tasks during an operation.</p>
<p>Discount Factor: During some operations where multiple tasks are performed in-conjunction the contractor may be able to utilize supervisory and topside support personnel and equipment to conduct the tasks simultaneously and apply a discounted to the subordinate tasks performed.</p>
<p>Ship Tag-Outs: The contractor shall notify the ship scheduled for the diving operation and any adjacent vessels of the work to be performed, locations where divers may be present and which systems must be secured for safe diving operations. The tag-out process should be initiated in advance of the full crew and equipment arriving to perform the requested work. The contractor shall prepare a Work Authorization Form (WAF) and tag-out list, and deliver to the ship's Chief Engineer or Command Duty Officer. The ship will acknowledge receipt by signature, name, and rank/position and state (in writing) the anticipated time tag-out will be completed.</p>
<p>Crew Size:<br />(a) The contractor's crew shall, at a minimum, be comprised of sufficient personnel to meet Federal, State, OSHA, and United States Coast Guard regulations in effect at the time of commencement of efforts under the contract.<br />(b) Work performed under this contract is typically carried out under the hull of a ship located pier side (single and double deck piers), breasted alongside another ship pier side or at anchorage. The hazard analysis/assessment of the dive(s) may dictate the use of more personnel even though not specifically required in these regulations. These risks include, but are not limited to, restricted access to the surface, suctions, underwater debris, and the possibility of diver entanglement. Crew sizes shall be comprised of sufficient numbers to safely perform services under each task. Contractor crew size shall be adequate to support these required diving hours throughout the extent of the operational day.<br />(c) For both fixed rate and hourly rate tasks, additional personnel are acceptable to allow the contractor to increase efficiency. However, compensation for additional personnel for hourly rate tasks WILL NOT be permitted unless specifically approved in advance and in writing by MSC on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Ship Class: All ships with a similar hull design; the hull type designator will be used to indicate the ship's class (unit) in Tasks 01, 02, and 03. When the design parameters change significantly, a separate class will be identified and the same hull type designator will be used followed by the first hull number indicating the new class. All subsequent ships shall be charged to this class (unit). This list will be amended on a case-by-case basis to reflect new construction, decommissioned, and re-commissioned ships.</p>
<p>Underwater Coating Application: Hull coating repairs shall be defined as the surface preparation and application of coatings to include anti-corrosion coatings and dielectric shields. Unit area is a square foot. The typical surface preparation and application is approximately 130 square feet. These coating restorations are typically performed on, but not limited to, ships' hull, rudders, struts, rope guards, fairwaters, and impressed current cathodic protection system.</p>
<p>Underwater Hull Survey: For the purpose of this contract, an underwater hull survey shall be defined as a quantitative inspection and digital record of the condition of a vessel's underwater hull and appendages. The survey shall consist of a series of measurements of the hull plate thickness, hull coating thickness, and hull electro-potential. Data readings shall be evenly distributed across the surveyed surface and each reading shall be correlated to its relative hull position. The survey shall also include video of the surveyed surfaces and digital still images of all damage discovered.</p>
<p>Ship Debrief: Upon conclusion of the operation, the contractor shall brief the ship's Chief Engineer or the Command Duty Officer on the material condition observed and reported on each underwater system inspected, cleaned, or repaired.</p>

Variations due to local restrictions may be reviewed by the Navy Hull Cleaning Representative and approved by MSC on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The time limits specified in Tasks 01 through 03 are for individual Tasks.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>Task 01- Full Hull Cleaning:</p>
<p>When the fouling meets NSTM-081 thresholds for cleaning, the contractor shall completely remove all marine fouling from the entire underwater hull; propeller(s) and dunce cap(s), shaft(s), associated strut(s) and bearing housing(s) and rotating coupling cover(s) and fairwater(s) and rope guard(s); rudder(s); bilge keels, all gratings, screens, and splitter bars on hull penetrations, appendages; and stabilization systems (e.g. fins, auxiliary propulsion units, secondary propulsion motors). The area along the ship waterline shall be cleaned to a height of 12 inches above the waterline; based on ships draft during the cleaning operation. At completion of the cleaning, the cleaned surface shall conform to NSTM Chapter 081. Extreme caution shall be exercised by the contractor to prevent damage to the coating and ship systems by any of its operations, procedures, or equipment.</p>
<p>In cases of unsatisfactory paint conditions (soft, blistered or peeling paint) or extreme levels of fouling (extremely heavy calcareous growth resulting from ineffective Anti-Fouling paint and/or too long an interval between cleanings), the designated Navy Hull Cleaning Representative is authorized to approve selective cleaning of the hull surface and/or leaving basal plate material on the surface, removal of which would result in removal of paint.</p>
<p>In the event propeller damage (e. g. erosion) prohibits attaining a 'B' finish (as defined in NSTM chapter 081), the Navy Hull Cleaning Representative shall be contacted for guidance. MSC may, on a case basis, waive requirements for surface finish for damaged propellers.</p>
<p>The contractor shall inspect the condition of the underwater hull and ship systems both before and after the cleaning operation as follows:</p>
<p>(a) The contractor, for his own protection, shall inspect the hull and appendages to determine the condition prior to cleaning and document on the pre-cleaning biofouling inspection data form.</p>
<p>(b) In the event underwater inspection reveals only light fouling, or in the event underwater inspection reveals excessive calcareous fouling, paint deterioration, or other gross defects affecting the operational capabilities of the ship, e.g., propeller damage; the contractor shall inform the Navy Hull Cleaning Representative and the Ship's Engineering Officer of the location, and request a decision to proceed or cancel the cleaning operation. The Ship's Chief Engineer, with advice from the Navy Hull Cleaning Representative, is authorized to cancel the cleaning operation based on the results of the contractor's inspection of the underwater hull condition. Compensation in such a case reverts to that provided for under Task 11, or other as appropriate.</p>
<p>A DETAILED LEVEL I INSPECTION OF THE SHIP'S HULL AND APPENDAGES IS PART OF THIS TASK.</p>
<p>(c) Immediately upon completion of cleaning, the contractor shall inspect the hull and appendages to determine the condition of accessible components. The contractor shall inspect, photograph, and document the general condition of each accessible component and any damage discovered shall be inspected and documented to the detail of a Level I inspection, as defined in the Underwater Ship Husbandry Manual, Chapter 17, "Inspections", (NAVSEA S0600-AA-PRO-170). The ship's Chief Engineer, with advice from the Navy Hull Cleaning Representative, may request the contractor to perform a more detailed Level II inspection of the damage under Task 11.</p>
<p>(d) In either case, whether a cleaning was performed or canceled, these inspections shall be performed and recorded on the diver hull inspection data sheets and stored on the hull inspection database.</p>
<p>Experience to date has shown that certain ship classes can be cleaned and inspected in less time than that indicated below, unless delayed by unforeseen circumstances.<br />(a) AK-5158, ATF, ARS, AGOS, AGM, AGS, HST, and all other ships not listed 2 work days,<br />(b) AO, AOE, AOT, AS, AVB, AFSB, AH, AK, ASB, ESB, ESD, LCC, LPD, AKE, AKR 3 work days</p>

This Task shall not be used to charge the administrative hours required to prepare, monitor, and track the documentation.<br />(l) The contractor will not be compensated for additional divers or tenders, at the respective unit prices of Task 14 or Task 15, to augment the crew size beyond what was initially proposed in order to safely conduct work under a vessel or craft, unless specifically approved in writing by MSC.<br />(m) The contractor will be compensated for Government requested premium time as defined in Task 18. Premium time shall be charged per operational hour per Task when authorized by the on-scene Navy Hull Cleaning Representative. Premium time is not allowable for work in the Middle East or in locations where personnel are mobilized from the Middle East. When mobilized to perform work at an area outside the proposed base(s) of operation the normal workweek shall be based upon the normal workweek for which the majority of the crew originated.<br />(n) The contractors compensation under Task 19 for Government caused delays and standby as follows:<br />(1) Delays that occur within the first 30 minutes of the day allowance for set up and dive brief will not be compensated. If ship(s) tag outs and port operations clearance to dive is not received within the first 30 Minutes of the day, the brief will commence upon receipt and the contractor will be allowed an additional 10 minutes to complete the dive brief,<br />(2) Delays shall be cumulative per day,<br />(3) The contractor will not be compensated for first 60 minutes of delay unless the delay exceeds the 1 hour mark, then the contractor can charge for 1 hour.<br />(4) Daily delays (per crew) exceeding 60 minutes shall be rounded to closest quarter hour.<br />(5) At normal bases of operation, the maximum daily charge per crew shall not exceed four (4) hours per day unless approved by the on-scene Navy Hull Cleaning Representative on a case-by-case basis.<br />(6) When mobilized to an operation outside of a normal base of operation stand by charges shall be four (4) hours; less any hourly rate Tasks that may have been performed that day.<br />(7) When mobilized to an operation outside of a normal base of operation (within limited areas specifically defined in Task 21) the stand by charges will be compensated for the time of air travel of the crew, when approved in advance by MSC on a case -by-case basis. A record of the crews travel time shall be submitted with the Cost Summary Report to list airport departure and arrival times for each crewmember, the average time (round to nearest whole number) shall be calculated for crew travel time, which will then be multiplied by this unit price for compensation.</p>
<p>PREMIUM TIME IS NOT APPLICABLE FOR TRAVEL TIME COMPENSATION. <br />(8) Security requirements for base access (excluding issuance of personnel identification cards/passes) may cause delays. Government caused delays resulting from base security vehicle inspections will be compensated when the entire crew arrives at the base and equipment arrives at the base security inspection station until the equipment is released from the base security. The contractor shall immediately notify in writing the Navy Hull Cleaning Representative and two levels of management within their organization of the delay. Upon exiting the inspection station, the contractor has ten (10) minutes to transit to the pier to commence with set up.<br />(9) If Government caused delays occur during the time the contractor elects to work beyond the normal workday or outside the normal workweek (inclusive of any delay time), no additional compensation is allowed for Government caused delays.<br />(10) In the event the Government requests the contractor to remain on-site to tend to a ship the contractor may charge the delay rate per crew as requested by the on-scene Navy Hull Cleaning Representative and approved by MSC on a case-by-case basis.<br />(11) In the event the Government requests the contractor to standby at locations outside the normal base of operations, the contractor may charge the standby rate per crew for four (4) hours per day for days in which no work is assigned.<br />(o) Compensation for premium time, delays, and the various work Tasks may occur concurrently or simultaneously. Below are a few examples:<br />(1) On the last day of a full hull cleaning the crew and equipment arrive at 0730 hours at base security's truck inspection station and are delayed two (2) hours waiting for and conducting the inspection. The crew then arrives at the ship, sets up in the next 30 minutes, receives tag out and commences diving. The normal work day would end at 1530 hours. The contractor may charge for the two hours of loss in productivity due to the security delay. The 2 hours of work lost from the security delay may be performed the following normal work day. If the Government requests the contractor to work two hours beyond the normal work day then 2 hours of premium time (1530-1730 hours) may be charged. If the contractor chooses to work for their own convenience beyond the normal workday then they will not be allowed to charge the premium time.<br />(2) On the second day of a three day interim cleaning the entire crew arrived at the ship at 0800 hours. The ship failed to deliver the tag-out until 1000 hours. The crew then commenced with the dive brief within the allotted 10 minutes and began the cleaning. Then the Navy Hull Cleaning Representative requested the contractor to work 4 hours beyond the normal work day to finish the cleaning on day two. The contractor may charge for 2 hour of delay for the loss in productivity due to the tag out delay, plus 4 hours premium time as requested by the Navy Hull Cleaning representative.<br />(3) During a partial hull cleaning with multi-brush equipment and hydro-blasting port operations directs the divers to exit the water for 2 hours for a ship movement. The Navy representative requests the contractor to work 2 additional hours to complete the multi-brush and hydro-blast cleaning.

<DESC>IGF::OT::IGF Roof Replacement on the Black Rock Visitor Center for Joshua Tree National Park. 
This is a sources sought notice and is a market research tool being utilized for informational and planning purposes. Your responses will assist the Government in the development of its acquisition strategy for a possible Request for Proposal (RFP), to be issued at a later date, and in determining whether any type of small business set-aside is possible for this procurement or whether full and open competitive procedures should be utilized. If full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals.
The National Park Service at Lake (NPS) is considering a roof replacement for the Black Rock Visitor Center contract at Joshua Tree National Park in Yucca Valley, California.  The structure was constructed in 1970 as the primary lodge and visitor center for the then privately owned and operated Jellystone Campground. This was the very first Jellystone Campground in the state of California, and the third in the entire country. The historic significance of the lodge and the integrity of historic characteristics have been determined sufficient to warrant restoration of the building. The goal of this project is to replace the deteriorated roof and all roof trim (rakes and facias), and restore the roof and trim of the Black Rock Nature Center to their historic appearance. The project will be implemented using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 238160 Roofing Contractors.  The small business size standard is $15.0 million in average annual receipts.

Statements and must include the information requested below. Responses greater than 5 double-sided pages (including all attachments) will not be considered.

A.	Company Profile to include:

3.	Year the firm was established and number of employees;
4.	Points of contact (names, titles, phone numbers and email addresses);
5.	DUNS number and CAGE Code, as registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at http://www.sam.gov/:

Include a brief summary of the similar work performed, supporting narrative to show why each project is relevant to this sources sought notice and other relevant information such as any teaming or joint venture partners. In addition, include proof of satisfactory past performance on the referenced projects.
This notice shall not be construed as a RFP or as any commitment or obligation on the part of the Government to issue a solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request, so proposals will not be considered. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.
Response is strictly voluntary - it is not mandatory to submit a response to this notice to participate in any formal RFP process that may take place in the future.

Arthrex Trimano Shoulder Support Device
Statement of Need

Background:
The Lebanon VA Medical Center (LVAMC) has a requirement for two (2) Arthrex Trimano Shoulder Support devices, and five (5) Trimano Fortis Adapters.  The devices we currently utilize are inoperable.  One is unable to be repaired and the other is out for repair at the present time, leaving us with no working device.

Scope of Work:  
This device is used by Orthopedic Surgeons to correctly, and precisely position the shoulder in correct alignment during surgery.  The devices purchased must be Arthrex, as we already have the disposable sterile sleeves and additional accessories used with this device in stock.  Also, the Orthopedic staff is trained to use this device, and would not need to have additional training in order to perform the shoulder surgery cases.  The adaptors are the only coupling devices that will work with the Arthrex Trimano Shoulder support device, and are needed as they are the intermediate element to couple the sterile set (Arm Holder, Wrap, and Sterile Cover).  

Salient Characteristics of the Arthrex Trimano Shoulder Support Device:
Affixes to the Operating Table Rail
One hand release 
Weight   Support Arm   Approximately 3.4kg
Weight   Quick Change Coupling   Approximately 0.6kg
The Fortis Adaptor (Coupling Device) fits onto the Retaining Arm Device and engages into and locks into the arm securing the sterile set.  This Arthrex Trimano Fortis Adaptor is the only one which will work with the Trimano Support Device.


Additional Information:
The Arthrex Trimano Should Support Device is the only device that will work with the Arthrex accessories we currently have in stock at Lebanon, and this is also the unit the OR staff and Surgeons are trained to use.

Delivery:
Delivery shall be within thirty (30) days from the time of award.  The Arthrex Trimano Shoulder Support Device shall be delivered to the Lebanon VAMC located at 1700 S. Lincoln Ave., Lebanon, PA 17042; Attn; Warehouse.  BioMedical Engineering will need to perform a safety check and enter the equipment into the system for annual Preventive Maintenance (PM) checks.  Placement in the LVAMC clinic shall be coordinated through the OR Nurse Manager and/or Contracting Officer Representative.

SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK

1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.  
 
Contractor shall continue to provide Glucose Management System software to include maintenance, software updates (software updates are improvements or bug fixes to existing software purchased by Hines VAMC), software upgrades, technical support, and use/lease of licenses as defined herein.   Minimum of 23 ICU beds require software.  

Overview:  The Glucose Management System is a comprehensive clinical approach for controlling blood glucose levels for critically ill patients in hospitals. The system primarily applies to patients receiving continuous nutrition and receiving insulin intravenously. This system is applicable to any patient with elevated blood glucose, with or without diabetes.  

Purpose:   Hyperglycemia is a common problem in patients in the ICU s, leading to increased morbidity and mortality, increased length of stay and increased cost. The challenge of controlling blood glucose for critically ill patients is adapting the dosing to the patient s changing response to insulin, the adverse effect of high blood glucose on the immune system, and the risk of low blood glucose causing harm to the patient. We presently have a complex insulin drip protocol that we use at Hines to achieve glucose control, but have had significant problems with achieving glucose control in a timely manner and is associated with significant episodes of hypoglycemia which can be harmful to patients.  The Glucose Management System is a computer program that automatically adjusts the insulin drip dosing hourly to achieve glycemic control more rapidly with far fewer instances of hypoglycemia. This has been proven to improve patient safety, decrease morbidity and mortality in the ICU, reduce hospital acquired infections, reduce acute renal failure, quicker conversion to subcutaneous insulin as well as decrease length of stay and costs.  A number of studies have shown that there is actual cost savings associated with institution of a policy of good glycemic control in hospitalized patients. This is because the incremental cost of intensive glycemic management is more than offset by savings due to decreased time in ICU, decreased time on ventilators, decreased use of other resources such as antibiotics, dialysis, blood transfusions, and decreased hospital length of stay.  

The Contractor shall submit with his/her signed quote the following information in order to be given full consideration for award.

Manufacturer s name of software - include version etc.

<DESC>Announcement Number: 1305M2-19-00068<br />Project Title: Paroscientific, Model 410K-272, Digiquartz 4000 Pressure Transducer with Hip Taper Seal Fitting
<p>The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Paroscientific, Inc., 4500 148th Avenue N.E., Redmond, WA 98052, using the procedures in FAR Part 13, to purchase twenty (20) Paroscientific, P/N: 1801-004-0 with SCD No. 7271-272 buffer tube model 410K-272 Digiquartz Transducer with range 0 to 10,000 psia, frequency output, oil filled, installed in shock mount housing with custom length stainless steel buffer tube for the tsunami bottom pressure recorders in support of the Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) program.</p>
<p>The Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) program is a scientific research program developed several years ago by the NOAA Office of Atmospheric Research (OAR) at their Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) facility. The current DART program consists of a network of 39 buoys having bottom pressure sensors on the ocean floor that provide early reporting and warning of tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean and in other oceans. The DART program was declared fully operational in 2003, and full responsibility for the operation of the deployed network of DART buoys was permanently transferred to NDBC in FY2004. Due to the harsh marine conditions and occasional vandalism the NDBC is unable to recover and reuse approximately 5 systems per year. Further, the NDBC must address the replacement of aging sensors and sensors damaged due to pressure vessel failures.</p>
<p>All of the DART electrical, mechanical, and electronic equipment currently used in the DART program and on DART buoys is the result of custom engineering design and fabrication accomplished by PMEL directly, or through sole-source contractors, and much of it is proprietary. During the design process, PMEL integrated several custom manufactured electronics assemblies into the electronic sensor and data acquisition system used on the DART buoys. The buoy electronic assembly is the DART Acoustic Modem/CPU Assembly, which PMEL built, and which consists of several proprietary, custom designed printed circuit boards for controlling the Acoustic Modem and Iridium modem link. Three Dart Benthos Acoustic Modem/CPU Assemblies and one Paroscientific Bottom Pressure Transducer are used on every DART buoy in the present PMEL designed configuration. Two of the Modem/CPU assemblies are used in the DART buoy hull, one for primary data acquisition, and one as a secondary system in case of failure of the primary unit; the third is used in the Bottom Pressure Sensor suite. There are also other custom designed peripheral equipment integral to the operation of the DART buoy, including two Benthos Acoustic Modem Transducers used for wireless acoustic signal communications with the bottom pressure sensor equipment suite, an EdgeTech Acoustic release Module which can be used to release the Bottom Pressure Sensor suite from the mooring for recovery. Data is transmitted back to the NDBC and the tsunami warning centers through the Iridium uplink.</p>
<p>The Bottom Pressure Sensor suite of equipment which includes the third DART Acoustic Modem/CPU Assembly, also contains a very special Paroscientific pressure transducer as the ocean floor or seabed sensor. This is one of the most critical parts of the system because the pressure transducer sits on the ocean floor and monitors the changes in the pressure of the water column above the sensor. The systems then sends pressure data back to the electronics data acquisition units on the buoy via acoustic modems, and changes in the pressure data is the first sign of an approaching tsunami. PMEL selected the Paroscientific Model 410K-252 for use as the DART Bottom Pressure Sensor and it is now integral to the design; no other known sensor meets the design requirements, and Paroscientific is the only vendor who can supply these subassemblies because they are proprietary to the company. The NDBC changed the dilution tube design that interfaces to the sensor to prevent failures of the pressure vessel where the pressure sensor is housed. This change in the dilution tube is reflected in the part number as a model 410K-272. PMEL design proprietary printed circuit boards to interface to the bottom pressure sensor that transform frequency data from this pressure sensor into pressure data that can be incorporated into forecasts and warnings for tsunamis.<br />The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), Only one responsible source. <br />The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing, with a business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes, nor will one be posted on FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>Although a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if any interested party believes that it is capable of meeting the requirements, and in an effort to comply with the requirements outlined in FAR 5.102, a firm may request an electronic copy of the solicitation from the Contract Specialist, Wendy Culbreth (Wendy.Culbreth@noaa.gov).</p>
<p>All electronic correspondence shall have the subject line read: 1305M2-19-00068: Paroscientific Model 410K-LV-305 Digiquartz Pressure Transducer.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a Capability Statement and/or a quote in accordance with the solicitation, which shall be considered by the agency if received on or before 5:00 PM EST on November 3, 2018. The Capability Statement must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements.</p>
<p>The solicitation will remain open from 19 October 2018 - November 3, 2018 (5:00 PM EST).</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  
This special notice is being issued in order to provide all interested parties with information on the planned acquisition strategy as determined through market research.  
This procurement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis. A sources sought notice was posted to NECO/FedBizOps 12 December 2017 (N62470-18-R-3002) to determine availability and capability of businesses to perform the requirement. Given the nature of this work, particularly the size and complexity, market research revealed that there is not a reasonable expectation that offers from two (2) or more small businesses with acceptable technical proposals, at a reasonable price would be received if any type of set-aside was pursued.
NAVFAC Atlantics Office of Small Business Programs concurs with the determination to solicit as an unrestricted procurement.  
The solicitation will include NAVFACs standard small business evaluation factor which will require all entities to provide historical achievements in utilizing small business concerns as subcontractors and demonstrate their proposed small business participation and commitment strategies. In addition, large business entities will be required to provide a small business subcontracting plan which will include NAVFACs standard subcontracting targets.
All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. All prospective contractors are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.
Additional information about the requirement will be provided in the pre-solicitation notice.
The solicitation is estimated to be issued in the second quarter of the Governments fiscal year. No additional information is currently available.

<p>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes.</p>
<p>(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of mitigating the sole-source basis cited below.</p>
<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division intends to solicit and award a single Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Continental Microwave and Tool Company, herein after referred to as Cobham, 11 Continental Drive, Exeter, NH 03833-4564, for Overhaul of Kevlin Brand AN/SPS-48 Rotary Couplers, Part Number 2246D. This effort is anticipated to be conducted on a sole-source basis IAW the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the anticipated substantial duplicative costs to the Government to qualify another manufacturer's product for shipboard use, which are not anticipated to be recouped through competition, and the anticipated unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements through any other source. Cobham, doing business as Continental Microwave, owns the data rights for manufacture and overhaul of the Kevlin brand coupler and is therefore considered the only responsible source possessing sufficient requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, and technical data required to perform the required overhauls. Cobham is also the only source that has been qualified in accordance with the In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) certification standards for manufacture and overhaul of the Kevlin brand AN/SPS-48 rotary couplers.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information from Contractors mitigating the sole-source basis cited above. Contractors with the capabilities and facilities to provide overhauls that meet the Government's specifications and qualification requirements for Kevlin Brand AN/SPS-48 Rotary Couplers may provide information to indicate their intent and capability.<br />All interested parties are encouraged to submit product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, production units, and production quantity breaks to mitigate the reason why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole-source basis as stated above, and/or identify other Government contracts with similar efforts for the Government's consideration.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>STILETTO/THUNDERSTORM TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION and EXPERIMENTATION 19-1A Passive Detection of Active Underwater Acoustic Emissions </strong></div>
</div>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS: Technology Demonstration and Experimentation Collaboration</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to solicit technology candidates from private industry, government research and development (R&amp;D) organizations and academia for inclusion in future capability demonstration and experimentation events focused on the passive detection of active underwater acoustic emissions.  This effort is sponsored by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Emerging Capability &amp; Prototyping, Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO).  The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the warfighter by demonstrating and experimenting with the capability in an operationally relevant environment.  The results of this effort will be used to inform decision makers of emerging and available technology solutions that enhance or improve existing capabilities.</p>
<p>Interested parties are welcome to submit their applications to participate in the demonstration and experimentation events.  Technologies at all classification levels will be considered, but the event is planned for the unclassified level.  This RFI is for Stiletto/Thunderstorm 19-1A, with demonstrations and experiments planned for February 2019 in the Key West, FL area or another available CONUS location.</p>
<p><strong>The application deadline is 5:00 PM EDT on 23 November 2018.</strong></p>
<p>This RFI is NOT a solicitation for procurement or other acquisition proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations.  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p><strong>B. BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>Stiletto/Thunderstorm provides an opportunity for technology developers to demonstrate and experiment with new and evolving technological capabilities in an operationally relevant environment, as well as to obtain insight into federal technology gaps and emerging needs.  The demonstration and experimentation environment enables a collaborative working relationship between government organizations, academia and industry.  This promotes the identification of emerging needs and an assessment of maturing technologies with the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the Department of Defense and interagency partners.  Stiletto/Thunderstorm provides a realistic demonstration environment for technology developers to interact with operational personnel.  Materiel solutions brought to the event are at a technology readiness level (TRL) of four (4) or greater (reference DoD TRL definition: http://www.acqnotes.com/acqnote/tasks/technology-readiness-level).</p>
<p>The Stiletto/Thunderstorm technology demonstration and experimentation event(s) involves individual or multiple technologies and is conducted with interagency partners.  The technology developer provides the capability for demonstration and experimentation and personnel for installation and integration into the overall event.  The technology developer operates the system during the event and uninstalls the system upon completion.  The Stiletto/Thunderstorm staff plans, coordinates and assists with the associated logistics of the technology demonstration and experimentation, and provides limited assistance for the installation and integration efforts. T he Stiletto/Thunderstorm staff will not assist with engineering changes to the demonstrated technology or system.</p>
<p>Industry, academia and other government organizations are invited to submit demonstration and experimentation applications addressing innovative technologies leading to possible government/industry collaboration for further development of emerging capabilities or fielding of mature capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>C. DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Stiletto and Thunderstorm 19-1A demonstration and experimentation event will focus on the passive detection of active underwater acoustic emissions.  The 19-1A event will primarily focus on developmental and mature technologies (TRL 4-9) and is planned to be conducted over a one to two week timeframe in February 2019 at a waterside location on or near Key West, FL.  Participation may not necessarily require the demonstrator to be present the entire period.  Under the direction of RRTO, the Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU) and the Stiletto Maritime Demonstration Program will lead the 19-1A demonstration and experimentation event, and the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) will provide support as required.</p>
<p>The top-level objective of the demonstrated technologies is to provide enhanced situational awareness of an underwater acoustic environment.  The technology should act as an acoustic spectrum analyzer that dynamically scans the underwater environment and identifies sources by frequency or frequency band, power and direction of the active emission(s).  Ideally a mature system will be small, light-weight, battery operated, handheld for operations in an underwater environment.  Respondents are invited to submit technology demonstration and experimentation applications for innovated technologies that can be deployed for a limited technology demonstration and experimentation event.</p>
<p>After a review of the vendor applications, the government may invite candidates to brief their capability to support the selection process and/or invite candidates to demonstrate and experiment with their capability during the Stiletto/Thunderstorm 19-1A demonstration and experimentation event with the intent to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities.  In addition, vendors may be selected for follow-on events at facility specific locations in support of future acquisition activities.  Industry participation in the demonstration and experimentation activities does not suggest or imply that the government will endorse, procure or purchase equipment.</p>

<p>Justification for Sole Source:<br />The 402d Commodities Maintenance Group (CMXG) uses VERICUT software to simulate CNC machining in order to detect errors, potential collisions, or areas of inefficiency. VERICUT enables NC programmers to correct errors before the program is ever loaded on the CNC machine, thereby eliminating manual prove- outs. VERICUT also optimizes NC programming cutting speeds for more efficient machining. VERICUT software was selected primarily for its compatibility with CATIA software, and no other sources are known that can provide the technical features VERICUT offers. The additional CATIA V5 Model Interface will add mission capability by allowing 3D CAD models to be imported directly without the use of a separate CAD/CAM system to read/write the formats. The software maintenance sought would provide phone/email support, software updates/upgrades, and license file support. The software is used with restricted rights by the Government. The technical data, specifications, and engineering data are proprietary to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), CGTEch. CGTech has no third-party resellers and does not authorize any other source to provide warranty support. The cost of the application license and annual maintenance is far more cost effective than attempting to replace the Government's existing software licenses and retrain personnel on a different software system. Attempts to replace the software with another system would<br />create undue incompatibility risk and delay the mission.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Zephyrtronics 3LMZT-7-BGA uses a patented airbath system that is crucial for heat sensitive components. The hot plates and infrared preheaters used on other manufacturer's reflow stations are not recommended for the type of rework and prototyping the 579th performs in the lab because of the possibility of thermal shock and printed circuit board fracturing that other manufacturer's higher temperature board preheating systems can cause. Zephyrtronics airbath convective bottom-side low temperature pre-heating system eliminates thermal shock and fracturing damage. The Zephyrtronics airbath system uses forced convection that completely disregards the topography (or bottomography) of a printed circuit board (PCB), allowing immediate, direct access of the warm air into all areas of the PCB assemblies that is crucial for total coverage of solder flow. This ensures that thermal reaction times, energy transfer rates and efficiency are consistent for the 579th PCB rework and prototyping requirements. The result is a higher level of quality assurance and customer confidence for critical warfighter components. To qualify another manufacturer's system to meet the same requirements as the 3LMZT-7-BGA could potentially take 1-2 years at exceptionally high costs.</span></strong></p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- <br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and <br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

This instrument is the only one manufactured in GMP conditions and is IVD registered and is necessary for the continuity of instrumentation in the laboratory. These important features make it the only instrument available to fit strict CLIA standards for human diagnostic standards. This instrument replaces the older model because the original parts are obsolete and the vendor is no longer supporting repairs. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to contract specialist at bwest@cdc.gov by 12:00 noon, eastern time on November 5, 2018</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>&nbsp;Description of requirement: The Florida Army National Guard (FLARNG) requires a total of 14 aqueous based parts washing machines at the following locations throughout Florida. The intent is sustainability and elimination of the use of organic solvents and their environmental impact by using a water based solution, drastically reducing the amount of hazardous fluid disposal, and help the Florida National Guard achieve a much lower environmental footprint. The machines must meet the basic requirements as described herein and the contractor must provide for a turnkey solution to put machines into operation (hook up to power and air), maintain the machines in good working order with all necessary supplies, and dispose of any waste material in accordance with any applicable laws or regulations. The preference will be for a month to month arrangement, not a long term lease, however the Government anticipates requiring machines for a period of at least a year and anticipates an ongoing requirement. Interested companies are requested to provide pricing and customary commercial terms, and are encouraged to submit multiple solutions if available. Solutions may include rental of equipment vs purchase of equipment, so long as the solution includes maintenance of machines in good working order as described above. Solutions may also include different machines which meet the salient functions, features and performance characteristics, and optional features of machines submitted for consideration. The Government contemplates including an Option clause in a resulting contract in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(e). The Government can fund a solution for a period not to exceed one year. Contractors shall quote pricing for solutions for a period of one year and pricing for one year periods thereafter for a total of four years. <br />Machine salient functions, features and performance characteristics:<br />- Must be able to heat cleaning solution to a minimum of 110&deg;F (43&deg;C) for maximum cleaning power and have a direct nozzle high pressure spray with pinpoint accuracy.<br />- Must be able to remove oil, grease and grime with minimal brushing from a high pressurized stream of Non-flammable water-based cleaner. Pressure equal to that of a pressure washer.<br />- Must have completely enclosed cleaning operation to decreases exposure and provide protection from harmful chemicals, grease, oil or fumes. While capable of using high pressure hand held nozzle and foot operated switch to clean parts by hand inserted through protective gloves.<br />- Must provide two handed operation through affixed chemical gloves with observation window for viewing work.<br />- Must have compressed air nozzle of 90-150psi that can be connected to shop standard air supply from air compressor, used when enclosure is closed to blow dry any of the water-based cleaner off the parts. <br />- Must have enclosure that can accommodate parts or equipment up to 26" wide, 18" long, and 21" tall, and weight of up to 110lbs.<br />Locations and quantity:<br />City Quantity<br />Avon Park, FL 1<br />Bonifay, FL 2<br />Haines City, FL 2<br />Jacksonville, FL 1<br />Miami, FL 1<br />Sarasota, FL 1<br />Starke (Camp Blanding), FL 2<br />Tallahassee, FL 1<br />Tampa, FL 1<br />Tavares, FL 1<br />West Palm Beach, FL 1<br />Total 14<br /><br />Evaluation and Award<br />Award will be made on the basis of price in accordance with FAR 13.106-1. Award will be made to the responsible contractor (see FAR Part 9) whose quote represents the best value on an "all-or-none" basis (see FAR 13.101(b)(1). Formal evaluation plans and establishing a competitive range, conducting discussions, and scoring quotations or offers are not required. Contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.<br />The contracting officer may-<br />(i) After preliminary consideration of all quotations or offers, identify from all quotations or offers received one that is suitable to the user, such as the lowest priced brand name product, and quickly screen all lower priced quotations or offers based on readily discernible value indicators, such as past performance, warranty conditions, and maintenance availability. <br />If purchasing equipment, the Contracting Officer shall consider data available in the statistical reporting module of the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) regarding the supplier's past performance history for the Federal supply class (FSC) and product or service code (PSC) of the supplies being purchased. This solicitation incorporates by reference DFARS provision at 252.213-7000, Notice to Prospective Suppliers on the Use of Past Performance Information Retrieval System-Statistical Reporting in Past Performance Evaluations.<br />Contractors must quote all items and must be able to provide machines at all locations identified. The Government intends to evaluate quotes and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial quote should contain the contractor's best terms from a price standpoint. Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss or revise your quote. Contractors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their quote. Request for such information does not constitute discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government intends evaluate quotations and make a single, Firm-Fixed Price award with Options (see FAR 13.106-1(e)). Evaluation of pricing will be inclusive of options. Evaluation will be in accordance with FAR 13.106-2. The Contracting Officer shall consider all quotations furnished in response to this RFQ. <br />Prospective contractors must be registered at www.SAM.gov.<br />Prospective contractors must meet basic responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.104-1.<br />Quotations<br />Any response to this synopsis/solicitation will be considered a "quotation". Any reference to "offer", "bid" or similar in this solicitation shall be taken to mean "quotation". Any reference to "offeror, "bidder" or similar in this solicitation shall be taken to mean a company submitting a "quotation".<br />FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations.<br />(a) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />(b) When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing, as defined at 2.101. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />(c) If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. (See 13.302-4 for procedures on termination or cancellation of purchase orders.)</p>

<p>NAM CAR 1330-52.237-71 NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)<br />(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.<br />(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:<br />(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.<br />(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.<br />(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation.

The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p><br />NAM 1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018) <br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA. <br />(a) Definitions. Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members. Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim. Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: <br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures. <br />(b) Requirements. <br />1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. <br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. <br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. <br />i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. <br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable). <br />4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable. Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance. <br />i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed. <br />ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training. <br />iii. NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor. <br />iv. Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106. <br />5. The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees. <br />(c) Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline. For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee. All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including: <br />&#9679; Phone: 1-866-288-6558 <br />&#9679; Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org <br />&#9679; Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores) <br />&#9679; Text: (202) 335-0265 <br />(d) Confidentiality. Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties. <br />(e) Remedies. In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in: <br />1. Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract; <br />2. Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract; <br />3. Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action; <br />4. Termination of the contract for default or cause, in accordance with the termination clause of this contract; <br />5. Suspension or debarment; or 6. Other appropriate action. <br />(End of Solicitation and Contract language)<br />NAM 1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.<br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating do not apply.</p>
<p>(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 4:00 P.M. MT on October 31, 2018. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Marilyn Herrera. The E-mail address is Marilyn.Herrera@noaa.gov and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>
<p>(XVI) Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Marilyn Herrera, (303) 497-3870, E-mail address is Marilyn.Herrera@noaa.gov .</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NON-RECEIPT OF QUOTES. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE A CONFIRMATION OF THE QUOTE RECEIPT.</p>

<p>&nbsp;DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</p>
<p><strong>Background - This is a new requirement</strong></p>
<p>International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) leads the Department of State (DOS) anti-crime and counter-narcotics efforts in Mexico. INL's mission is to minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on the United States, its citizens, and partner nations by providing effective foreign assistance and fostering global cooperation. The Merida Initiative, signed in 2008, is an unprecedented<br />partnership between the United States and Mexico to fight organized crime and associated violence while furthering respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Mexican Congress approved a Justice Sector Reform effort to transition from a traditional mixed inquisitorial justice system toward a more efficient oral, accusatorial model. In order to monitor reform progress within the different Attorneys' General Offices (AGO) in all 32 Mexican states, assess the adequate implementation of Mexican prosecutors' newly-assigned roles and responsibilities<br />and document the effective targeting of USG investment in this reform, INL Mexico developed a tool that provides information regarding how and in what context Mexican prosecutors make decisions within the Accusatorial Criminal Justice System (ACJS) and the factors that lead to these decisions.<br />The Process Mapping for State Prosecutors Tool (Tool) identifies the substantive processes followed by Mexican State Prosecutors under Mexico's ACJS and identifies performance indicators and efficiency gaps along the processes. It is important to note that the Tool and accompanying documents are semi-final products that will be provided to the winning proposal five days after award notification.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to apply the Tool and obtain qualitative and quantitative information in areas of opportunity within state AGOs in Mexico. This project will produce state-by-state detailed and executive-level reports for every AGO in Mexico. The Detailed Reports will offer an in-depth explanation of the evaluated state's socio-demographic and criminal context, information about the organizational structure and geographic distribution of the AGO, and the tool will assist in assessing how the key decisions are made by the AGO in each region through application of the Tool. The Executive Report will offer precise information to make public policy decisions. This report will highlight potentially problematic areas in the decision-making criteria at three levels (regulatory, institutional and individual).</p>

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT:<br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)<br />(a) The award will be made to the contractor whose price is the lowest of all offers determined to be technically qualified of performing the required service in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items. Technically qualified is defined as meeting the minimum requirements in Technical, Past Performance and Price as listed below. No trade-offs are made. To receive consideration for an award, the offer must NOT receive an "unacceptable" rating for the non-price factors.<br />The Government may make an award based on initial quotes received without discussions with quoters. Accordingly, each offer should be submitted in a completed form, without exception to any requirements.<br />Failure to submit mandatory information for a factor, indicated by the word SHALL, will result in a rating of "unacceptable" for that factor, and the offer will be ineligible for award. It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient information for the Government to determine technical acceptability, successful and satisfactory past performance and price. Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine technical acceptability, past performance or price may be cause for rejection of your quote.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) Price</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;Capability</p>
<p>(iii) Past Performance</p>
<p>a.Offerors SHALL complete and submit the Line Item Break Down_Price Schedule with their Quote and include a price for each line item. Failure to do so will result in the offer being rejected without further consideration.</p>
<p>b.The Contracting Officer will evaluate each Quoters price to determine price reasonableness. In this context, reasonableness will be determined by comparing offered prices to one another, to the Government estimate and to pricing for previous work of a similar nature.</p>
<p>(ii). CAPABILITY:<br />a.The Offeror SHALL submit evidence of the capability to meet the minimum requirements as specified in this solicitation and the attached Statement of Work. Proposal shall demonstrate that the offeror can provide the skills, equipment, and personnel required to perform the specified type of services are available, or can become available if the contract is awarded.</p>
<p>b.The capability factor SHALL receive an adjectival rating based on the assessed strengths and inadequacies of each offer as they relate to the Experience rating with details descriptions are show in below:</p>
<p>CAPABILITY: RATING</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE Vendor clearly meets the minimum capability of the performance work statement</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE Vendor does not clearly meet the minimum capability of the performance work statement</p>
<p><br />(iii)PAST PERFORMANCE:<br />To demonstrate satisfactory past performance the offeror SHALL provide documentation of satisfactory performance on two (2) past or current contracts of a similar type, size, scope and complexity, performed within the last two (2) years including references, with names and contact information of the references who can verify such past performance. Past performance information of key personnel may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance. In the case of a vendor with only one or without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the vendor will be evaluated as "Neutral" on Past Performance, providing the vendor supplies a certified statement with their quote that no past performance information is available. The preferred method of evaluating Past Performance is the attached USACE Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ). The Government's approach will be to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance. In addition to the above, the Government may review any other sources, as well as data obtained from other sources available, i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating acceptable past performance rests with the offeror.<br /><br />PAST PERFORMANCE RATING<br />ACCEPTABLE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option (s).</p>

The<br />Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>

<p>(i) Cloud computing services shall be subject to the security requirements specified in the clause 252.239-7010, Cloud Computing Services, of this contract.</p>
<p>(ii) Any other such IT service or system (i.e., other than cloud computing) shall be subject to the security requirements specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>(2) For covered contractor information systems that are not part of an IT service or system operated on behalf of the Government and therefore are not subject to the security requirement specified at paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the following security requirements apply:</p>
<p>(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered contractor information system shall be subject to the security requirements in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br />Special Publication (SP) 800-171, ``Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations'' (available via the internet at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171) in effect at the time the solicitation is issued or as authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>(D) If the Contractor intends to use an external cloud service provider to store, process, or transmit any covered defense information in performance of this contract, the Contractor shall require and ensure that the cloud service provider meets security requirements equivalent to those established by the Government for the Federal Risk<br />and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate baseline (https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/) and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment.</p>
<p>(3) Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2)<br />of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate special circumstances (e.g., medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These measures may be addressed in a system security plan.</p>
<p>(c) Cyber incident reporting requirement.</p>
<p>(1) When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractor's ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, the Contractor shall--</p>
<p>(i) Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information systems on the Contractor's network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractor's ability to provide operationally critical support; and</p>
<p>(ii) Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil.</p>
<p>(2) Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required elements at http://dibnet.dod.mil.</p>

When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center<br />(DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer. Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e) Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.<br /><br />(f) Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.</p>
<p>(g) Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent<br />practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.</p>
<p>(i) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD.

<p>(j) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the Government's use and release of such information.</p>
<p>(k) The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.</p>
<p>(l) Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable<br />clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>(m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall--</p>
<p>(1) Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The<br /><br />Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and</p>
<p>(2) Require subcontractors to--</p>
<p>(i) Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and</p>

<p>NON-DEFENSE HEALTH AGENCY (NON-DHA) HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT (HIPAA) BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT (BAA) (7 JULY<br />2014)</p>
<p>Introduction<br /><br />In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(2) and 164.504(e) and paragraph C.3.4.1.3 of DoD 6025.18-R, "DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation," January 24, 2003, this document serves as a BAA between the signatory parties for purposes of the HIPAA and the "HITECH Act" amendments thereof, as implemented by the HIPAA Rules and DoD HIPAA Issuances (both defined below). The parties are a DoD Military Health System (MHS) component, acting as a HIPAA covered entity, and a DoD contractor, acting as a HIPAA business associate. The HIPAA Rules require BAAs between covered entities and business associates. Implementing this BAA requirement, the applicable DoD HIPAA Issuance (DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C3.4.1.3) provides that requirements applicable to business associates must be incorporated (or incorporated by reference) into the contract or agreement between the parties.</p>
<p>(a) Catchall Definition. Except as provided otherwise in this BAA, the following terms used in this BAA shall have the same meaning as those terms in the DoD HIPAA Rules: Data Aggregation, Designated Record Set, Disclosure, Health Care Operations, Individual, Minimum Necessary, Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP), Protected Health Information (PHI), Required By Law, Secretary, Security Incident, Subcontractor, Unsecured Protected Health Information, and Use.</p>
<p>-Breach means actual or possible loss of control, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to PHI or other PII (which may include, but is not limited to PHI), where persons other than authorized users gain access or potential access to such information for any purpose other than authorized purposes, where one or more individuals will be adversely affected. The foregoing definition is based on the definition of breach in DoD Privacy Act Issuances as defined herein.</p>
<p>-Business Associate shall generally have the same meaning as the term "business associate" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of Business Associate signatory to this BAA].</p>
<p>-Agreement means this BAA together with the documents and/or other arrangements under which the Business Associate signatory performs services involving access to PHI on behalf of the MHS component signatory to this BAA.</p>
<p>-Covered Entity shall generally have the same meaning as the term "covered entity" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of MHS component signatory to this BAA].</p>
<p>-DHA Privacy Office means the DHA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office. The DHA Privacy Office Director is the HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer for DHA, including the National Capital Region Medical Directorate NCRMD).</p>
<p>-DoD HIPAA Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the HIPAA Rules in the DoD Military Health System (MHS). These issuances are DoD 6025.18-R (2003), DoDI 6025.18 (2009), and DoD 8580.02-R (2007).</p>
<p>-DoD Privacy Act Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the Privacy Act, which are DoDD 5400.11 (2007) and DoD 5400.11-R (2007).</p>
<p>-HHS Breach means a breach that satisfies the HIPAA Breach Rule definition of breach in 45 CFR 164.402.</p>
<p>-HIPAA Rules means, collectively, the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules, issued by the<br />U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and codified at 45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164, Subpart E (Privacy), Subpart C (Security), Subpart D (Breach) and Part 160, Subparts C-D (Enforcement), as amended by the 2013 modifications to those Rules, implementing the "HITECH Act" provisions of Pub. L. 111-5. See 78 FR 5566- 5702 (Jan. 25, 2013) (with corrections at 78 FR 32464 (June 7, 2013)). Additional HIPAA rules regarding electronic transactions and code sets (45 CFR Part 162) are not addressed in this BAA and are not included in the term HIPAA Rules.</p>
<p>-Service-Level Privacy Office means one or more offices within the military services (Army, Navy, or Air Force) with oversight authority over Privacy Act and HIPAA privacy compliance.<br /><br />I. Obligations and Activities of Business Associate</p>
<p>(a) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by the Agreement or as required by law.</p>

If at any point the Business Associate becomes aware that a security incident involves a Breach, the Business Associate shall immediately initiate breach response as required by part V of this BAA.</p>
<p>(d) In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii)) and 164.308(b)(2), respectively), as applicable, the Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of the Business Associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to the Business Associate with respect to such PHI.</p>

<p>(g) The Business Associate shall maintain and make available the information required to provide an accounting of disclosures to the Covered Entity or an individual as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.528.</p>
<p>(h) To the extent the Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity's obligation(s) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the Business Associate shall comply with the requirements of HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to the Covered Entity in the performance of such obligation(s); and</p>
<p>(i) The Business Associate shall make its internal practices, books, and records available to the Secretary for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA Rules.</p>
<p>II. Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate</p>
<p>(a) The Business Associate may only use or disclose PHI as necessary to perform the services set forth in the Agreement or as required by law. The Business Associate is not permitted to de-identify PHI under DoD HIPAA issuances or the corresponding 45 CFR 164.514(a)-(c), nor is it permitted to use or disclose de-identified PHI, except as provided by the Agreement or directed by the Covered Entity.</p>
<p>(b) The Business Associate agrees to use, disclose and request PHI only in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule "minimum necessary" standard and corresponding DHA policies and procedures as stated in the DoD HIPAA Issuances.</p>
<p>(c) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the DoD HIPAA Issuances or HIPAA Privacy Rules if done by the Covered Entity, except uses and disclosures for the Business Associate's own management and administration and legal responsibilities or for data aggregation services as set forth in the following three paragraphs.</p>
<p>(d) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate. The foregoing authority to use PHI does not apply to disclosure of PHI, which is covered in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>(e) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may disclose PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate, provided that disclosures are required by law, or the Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed that it will remain confidential and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purposes for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person notifies the Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached.</p>
<p>(f) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI to provide Data Aggregation services relating to the Covered Entity's health care operations.<br /><br />III. Provisions for Covered Entity to Inform Business Associate of Privacy Practices and Restrictions</p>
<p>(a) The Covered Entity shall provide the Business Associate with the notice of privacy practices that the Covered Entity produces in accordance with 45 CFR 164.520 and the corresponding provision of the DoD HIPAA Issuances.</p>
<p>(b) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any changes in, or revocation of, the permission by an Individual to use or disclose his or her PHI, to the extent that such changes affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.</p>
<p>(c) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any restriction on the use or disclosure of PHI that the Covered Entity has agreed to or is required to abide by under 45 CFR 164.522, to the extent that such changes may affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.</p>
<p>IV. Permissible Requests by Covered Entity</p>
<p>The Covered Entity shall not request the Business Associate to use or disclose PHI in any manner that would not be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or any applicable Government regulations (including without limitation, DoD HIPAA Issuances) if done by the Covered Entity, except for providing Data Aggregation services to the Covered Entity and for management and administrative activities of the Business Associate as otherwise permitted by this BAA.</p>
<p>V. Breach Response</p>
<p>(a) In general.</p>
<p>In the event of a breach of PII/PHI held by the Business Associate, the Business Associate shall follow the breach response requirements set forth in this Part V, which is designed to satisfy both the Privacy Act and HIPAA as applicable. If a breach involves PII without PHI, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuance breach response requirements only; if a breach involves PHI (a subset of PII), then the Business Associate shall comply with both Privacy Act and HIPAA breach response requirements. A breach involving PHI may or may not constitute an HHS Breach. If a breach is not an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate has no HIPAA breach response obligations. In such cases, the Business Associate must still comply with breach response requirements under the DoD Privacy Act Issuances.</p>
<p>If the DHA Privacy Office determines that a breach is an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with both the HIPAA Breach Rule and DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the DHA Privacy Office, regardless of whether the breach occurs at DHA or at one of the Service components. If the DHA Privacy Office determines that the breach does not constitute an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office. The Business Associate shall contact the Covered Entity for guidance when the incident is not an HHS Breach.</p>
<p>This Part V is designed to satisfy the DoD Privacy Act Issuances and the HIPAA Breach Rule as implemented by the DoD HIPAA Issuances. In general, for breach response, the Business Associate shall report the breach to the Covered Entity, assess the breach incident, notify affected individuals, and take mitigation actions as applicable. Because DoD defines "breach" to include possible (suspected) as well as actual (confirmed) breaches, the Business Associate shall implement these breach response requirements immediately upon the Business Associate's discovery of a possible breach.</p>
<p>(b) Government Reporting Provisions</p>
<p>The Business Associate shall report the breach within one hour of discovery to the Covered Entity and to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT) -the other parties as deemed appropriate by the Covered Entity. The Business Associate is deemed to have discovered a breach as of the time a breach (suspected or confirmed) is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person (other than the person committing it) who is an employee, officer or other agent of the Business Associate.</p>
<p>The Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report using the online form at https://forms.us-cert.gov/report/. Before submission to US-CERT, the Business Associate shall save a copy of the on-line report. After submission, the Business Associate shall record the US-CERT Reporting Number. Although only limited information about the breach may be available as of the one hour deadline for submission, the Business Associate shall submit the US- CERT report by the deadline. The Business Associate shall e-mail updated information as it is obtained, following the instructions at http://www.us-cert.gov/pgp/email.html. The Business Associate shall provide a copy of the initial or updated US-CERT report to the -Covered Entity and the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office, if requested by either. Business Associate questions about US-CERT reporting shall be directed to the Covered Entity or Service- Level Privacy Office, not the US-CERT office.</p>
<p>The additional US Army and the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) reporting requirements are addressed in the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Policy. The latest version of this policy can be obtained from the Covered<br /><br />Entity or the MEDCOM Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at: usarmy.jbsa.medcom.list.medcom-foia-users@mail.mil . If multiple beneficiaries are affected by a single event or related set of events, then a single reportable breach may be deemed to have occurred, depending on the circumstances. The Business Associate shall inform the Covered Entity as soon as possible if it believes that "single event" breach response is appropriate; the Covered Entity will determine how the Business Associate shall proceed and, if appropriate, consolidate separately reported breaches for purposes of Business Associate report updates, beneficiary notification, and mitigation.</p>
<p>When a Breach Report initially submitted is incomplete or incorrect due to unavailable information, or when significant developments require an update, the Business Associate shall submit a revised form or forms, stating the updated status and previous report date(s) and showing any revisions or additions in red text. Examples of updated information the Business Associate shall report include, but are not limited to: confirmation on the exact data elements involved, the root cause of the incident, and any mitigation actions to include, sanctions, training, incident containment, follow-up, etc. The Business Associate shall submit these report updates promptly after the new information becomes available. Prompt reporting of updates is required to allow the Covered Entity to make timely final determinations on any subsequent notifications or reports. The Business Associate shall provide updates to the same parties as required for the initial Breach Report. The Business Associate is responsible for reporting all information needed by the Covered Entity to make timely and accurate determinations on reports to HHS as required by the HHS Breach Rule and reports to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office as required by DoD Privacy Act Issuances.</p>
<p>In the event the Business Associate is uncertain on how to apply the above requirements, the Business Associate shall consult with the Covered Entity (or the Service-Level Privacy Office, which will consult with the DHA Privacy Office as appropriate) when determinations on applying the above requirements are needed.</p>
<p>(c) Individual Notification Provisions</p>
<p>If the DHA Privacy Office determines that individual notification is required, the Business Associate shall provide written notification to individuals affected by the breach as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the breach is discovered and the identities of the individuals are ascertained. The 10 day period begins when the Business Associate is able to determine the identities (including addresses) of the individuals whose records were impacted.</p>
<p>The Business Associate's proposed notification to be issued to the affected individuals shall be submitted to the parties to which reports are submitted under paragraph V (a) for their review, and for approval by the DHA Privacy Office. Upon request, the Business Associate shall provide the DHA Privacy Office with the final text of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals. If different groups of affected individuals receive different notification letters, then the Business Associate shall provide the text of the letter for each group. (PII shall not be included with the text of the letter(s) provided.) Copies of further correspondence with affected individuals need not be provided unless requested by the Privacy Office. The Business Associate's notification to the individuals, at a minimum, shall include the following:</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be advised of what specific data was involved. It is insufficient to simply state that PII has been lost. Where names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or truncated SSNs, and Dates of Birth (DOBs) are involved, it is critical to advise the individual that these data elements potentially have been breached.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach. The description should be sufficiently detailed so that the individual clearly understands how the breach occurred.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must be informed of what protective actions the Business Associate is taking or the individual can take to mitigate against potential future harm. The notice must refer the individual to the current Federal Trade Commission (FTC) web site pages on identity theft and the FTC's Identity Theft Hotline, toll-free: 1-877-ID- THEFT (438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261.</p>
<p>-The individual(s) must also be informed of any mitigation support services (e.g., one year of free credit monitoring, identification of fraud expense coverage for affected individuals, provision of credit freezes, etc.) that the Business Associate may offer affected individuals, the process to follow to obtain those services and the period of time the services will be made available, and contact information (including a phone number, either direct or toll- free, e-mail address and postal address) for obtaining more information.</p>
<p>Business Associates shall ensure any envelope containing written notifications to affected individuals are clearly labeled to alert the recipient to the importance of its contents, e.g., "Data Breach Information Enclosed," and that the envelope is marked with the identity of the Business Associate and/or subcontractor organization that suffered the<br /><br />breach. The letter must also include contact information for a designated POC to include, phone number, email address, and postal address.</p>
<p>If the Business Associate determines that it cannot readily identify, or will be unable to reach, some affected individuals within the 10 day period after discovering the breach, the Business Associate shall so indicate in the initial or updated Breach Report. Within the 10 day period, the Business Associate shall provide the approved notification to those individuals who can be reached. Other individuals must be notified within 10 days after their identities and addresses are ascertained. The Business Associate shall consult with the DHA Privacy Office, which will determine which media notice is most likely to reach the population not otherwise identified or reached. The Business Associate shall issue a generalized media notice(s) to that population in accordance with Privacy Office approval.</p>
<p>The Business Associate shall, at no cost to the government, bear any costs associated with a breach of PII/PHI that the Business Associate has caused or is otherwise responsible for addressing.</p>
<p>Breaches are not to be confused with security incidents (often referred to as cyber security incidents when electronic information is involved), which may or may not involve a breach of PII/PHI. In the event of a security incident not involving a PII/PHI breach, the Business Associate shall follow applicable DoD Information Assurance requirements under its Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate finds that a cyber security incident involves a PII/PHI breach (suspected or confirmed), the Business Associate shall immediately initiate the breach response procedures set forth here. The Business Associate shall also continue to follow any required cyber security incident response procedures to the extent needed to address security issues, as determined by DoD/DHA.</p>
<p>VI. Termination</p>
<p>(a) Termination. Noncompliance by the Business Associate (or any of its staff, agents, or subcontractors) with any requirement in this BAA may subject the Business Associate to termination under any applicable default or other termination provision of the Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) Effect of Termination.</p>
<p>(1) If the Agreement has records management requirements, the Business Associate shall handle such records in accordance with the records management requirements. If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, the records should be handled in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) below. If the Agreement has provisions for transfer of records and PII/PHI to a successor Business Associate, or if DHA gives directions for such transfer, the Business Associate shall handle such records and information in accordance with such Agreement provisions or DHA direction.</p>
<p>(2) If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, except as provided in the following paragraph (3), upon termination of the Agreement, for any reason, the Business Associate shall return or destroy all PHI received from the Covered Entity, or created or received by the Business Associate on behalf of the Covered Entity that the Business Associate still maintains in any form. This provision shall apply to PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of the Business Associate. The Business Associate shall retain no copies of the PHI.</p>
<p>(3) If the Agreement does not have records management provisions and the Business Associate determines that returning or destroying the PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall provide to the Covered Entity notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the Covered Entity and the Business Associate that return or destruction of PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall extend the protections of the Agreement to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as the Business Associate maintains such PHI.</p>
<p>VII. Miscellaneous<br /><br />(a) Survival. The obligations of Business Associate under the "Effect of Termination" provision of this BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement.</p>
<p>(b) Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the Agreement shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that permits the Covered Entity and the Business Associate to comply with the HIPAA Rules and the DoD HIPAA Rules.</p>
<p>EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS (OCTOBER 2015)</p>
<p>1. The Contractor shall not employ or contract with any individual or entity (hereinafter collectively referred to as "person") to provide items or services that will be included in invoices submitted to the Government under this contract if such person is listed on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE) or the TRICARE Sanctioned Provider List.

<p>4. The Contractor is advised that during performance of the contract, MTF personnel will perform a recurrent recheck of the names of contractor personnel working in the MTF against the Lists, as specified in OTSG/MEDCOM Policy Memo 15-037. The Government will notify the Contractor in the event any contractor personnel working in the MTF appear on either of the Lists.</p>
<p>5. Should any person providing items or services under the contract appear on either of the Lists at any time during contract performance, the Contractor shall (a) in cases where the Contractor identified the person, notify the Contracting Officer, and (b) promptly remove that person from the contract.</p>
<p>6. Violation of any aspect of the above paragraphs shall be considered a material breach of the contract and may result in termination of the contract.</p>
<p>7. The Contractor is further advised that, in accordance with Civil Monetary Penalties Law [CMP] (codified at 42 USC &sect; 1320a-7a):</p>
<p>a. There are steep civil monetary penalties associated with billing the Government for providing items or services by a person on either of the Lists, and with failing to return to the Government any overpayments received for provision of such items or services.</p>
<p>b. Billing under the contract for provision of items or services by a person on either List may also result in exclusion of the person that employs or contracts with such person.</p>
<p>8. HHS OIG has issued a Special Advisory Bulletin on the Effect of Exclusion from Participation in Federal Health Care Programs with additional information on the CMP. The Special Advisory Bulletin may be found at http://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/files/sab-05092013.pdf.<br /><br />TOBACCO FREE MEDICAL CAMPUS (TFMC)</p>

<p><br />(1) [ <br /><br />] Are, [ <br /><br />] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for<br /><br />the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p><br />(2) [ <br /><br />] Have, [ <br /><br />] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a<br /><br />civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>

If discussions are held, the Government will allow Quoter s an opportunity to comment on any negative past performance information obtained by the Government. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

EVALUATION APPROACH
The award resulting from this solicitation will be made based on the lowest price technically acceptable to the government, considering technical capability, price, and past performance. 
The government will evaluate information based on the procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.106-2 using the following evaluation criteria:

Technical Capability   The evaluation process will consider whether the quote demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical features involved in meeting the requirements of the solicitation.  

Price   The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. The Government will evaluate price to determine whether or not it is considered fair and reasonable.

Past Performance   The quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the contractor s performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance in providing requirements similar in size, scope, and complexity to this solicitation. The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by the contractor.

All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. Consequently, contractors are highly encouraged to provide their best quote in their initial submissions. However, the Government reserves the right to communicate with any or all contractors submitting a quote, if it is determined advantageous to the Government to do so. If these communications take place, the Government is not obligated to communicate with every contractor (note that FAR Part 15 procedures do not apply; therefore, formal discussions are not applicable). All contractors will be treated fairly and impartially. A contractor may be eliminated from consideration without further communication if its quote is not among those contractors considered most advantageous to the Government based on a lowest price technically acceptable determination.
Quotes that merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement shall be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Contractors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation shall be rated unacceptable and thus will be ineligible for award. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "GO" must be achieved for the Technical Approach factor. Award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote, if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to the technical acceptability of another quote. 
All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Quotes must be submitted via electronic means by 4:30 P.M. ET on October31 , 2018. Quotes must be submitted electronically to FedBid.The quote must contain the contractor s name, address, telephone number, tax identification number, and Duns and Bradstreet Number.

If award criteria are based upon (b) price and other factors, the Contracting Officer shall clearly indicate the criteria to be applied elsewhere in this Buy.

In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Bidder/Offeror/Quoter must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received no later than the closing date and time for this Buy. Submissions can be sent to clientservices@fedbid.com.

For all buys other than Exact Match Sellers MUST document what they are bidding for evaluation for award. Sellers must include, extended specs and/or manufacturer name and part numbers (if applicable). Failure to do this may result in non-consideration of the Bid/Proposal/Quotation. This information is REQUIRED in order for a seller  s Bid/Proposal/Quotation to be evaluated for award. FAR 52.211-6.

In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), the evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price; however, cost/price will contribute substantially to the selection decision.

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT:<br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)<br />(a) The award will be made to the contractor whose price is the lowest of all offers determined to be technically qualified of performing the required service in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items. Technically qualified is defined as meeting the minimum requirements in Technical, Past Performance and Price as listed below. No trade-offs are made. To receive consideration for an award, the offer must NOT receive an "unacceptable" rating for the non-price factors.<br />The Government may make an award based on initial quotes received without discussions with quoters. Accordingly, each offer should be submitted in a completed form, without exception to any requirements.<br />Failure to submit mandatory information for a factor, indicated by the word SHALL, will result in a rating of "unacceptable" for that factor, and the offer will be ineligible for award. It is incumbent upon the offeror to submit sufficient information for the Government to determine technical acceptability, successful and satisfactory past performance and price. Failure to submit sufficient information for the government to determine technical acceptability, past performance or price may be cause for rejection of your quote.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) Price</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;Capability</p>
<p>(iii) Past Performance</p>
<p>a.Offerors SHALL complete and submit the Line Item Break Down_Price Schedule with their Quote and include a price for each line item. Failure to do so will result in the offer being rejected without further consideration.</p>
<p>b.The Contracting Officer will evaluate each Quoters price to determine price reasonableness. In this context, reasonableness will be determined by comparing offered prices to one another, to the Government estimate and to pricing for previous work of a similar nature.</p>
<p>(ii). CAPABILITY:<br />a.The Offeror SHALL submit evidence of the capability to meet the minimum requirements as specified in this solicitation and the attached Statement of Work. Proposal shall demonstrate that the offeror can provide the skills, equipment, and personnel required to perform the specified type of services are available, or can become available if the contract is awarded.</p>
<p>b.The capability factor SHALL receive an adjectival rating based on the assessed strengths and inadequacies of each offer as they relate to the Experience rating with details descriptions are show in below:</p>
<p>CAPABILITY: RATING</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE Vendor clearly meets the minimum capability of the performance work statement</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE Vendor does not clearly meet the minimum capability of the performance work statement</p>
<p><br />(iii)PAST PERFORMANCE:<br />To demonstrate satisfactory past performance the offeror SHALL provide documentation of satisfactory performance on two (2) past or current contracts of a similar type, size, scope and complexity, performed within the last two (2) years including references, with names and contact information of the references who can verify such past performance. Past performance information of key personnel may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance. In the case of a vendor with only one or without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the vendor will be evaluated as "Neutral" on Past Performance, providing the vendor supplies a certified statement with their quote that no past performance information is available. The preferred method of evaluating Past Performance is the attached USACE Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ). The Government's approach will be to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance. In addition to the above, the Government may review any other sources, as well as data obtained from other sources available, i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating acceptable past performance rests with the offeror.<br /><br />PAST PERFORMANCE RATING<br />ACCEPTABLE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option (s).</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modification #1</span></strong>:
<div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. The qualifications for the Electrical Engineer/ Power Systems Analysis Expert require the following: "The proposed Expert must be an Electrical Engineer, with a Master in Electrical Engineering or equivalent..."<br />Question: Most electrical engineers in consulting and utilities in the United States typically start their careers after a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and advance through their career by getting additional training and certifications. Typically, having an M.S. in Electrical Engineering is not very common (and fairly rare). Would you consider changing the academic requirements for this position to a B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering? Answer: Yes - Bachelor's degrees are accepted in place of the Masters.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>2. In the description of the qualifications requirement for the Project Leader/Manager there is no specific requirements for a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering as is the case with the qualifications requirements for Electrical Engineer/Power Systems Analyst. <br />Question: For the same reason as mentioned in the question above, would you confirm that a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and 10 year experience would be acceptable as the required background and experience for this position? <br />Answer: Yes - Bachelor's degrees are accepted in place of the Masters.</p>
<p>3. The RFP states as follows in Section 4 at the end of the description of personnel qualifications requirements: "The Contractor shall attach to its offer the signed CVs and certified copies of diplomas less than six (6) months old, for key personnel." <br />Question: Would you advise if copies of all degrees and diplomas (For all levels, assuming an expert has an B. S., M.S. etc.), for each proposed expert are to be submitted with the proposal or just for those individuals who have obtained their degree status within the past six months? <br />Answer: Each key personnel will be required to provide a signed CV and provide proof of graduation required for the function by providing a copy of their diploma.<br />This diploma will have to be authenticated by a certification dated less than six (6) months before the proposal submission date. The duration of 6 months does not concern the period of graduation.</p>
<p>4. The Evaluation Criteria in the RFP include the following: "4. Skills/Other Qualifications (20 points)"<br />Question: This award criterion is vague. In order to ensure that all proposals are evaluated on the same basis of requirements, would you kindly clarify what is required of the bidders under the criterion "Skills/Other Qualifications"? <br />Answer: Skills/Other Qualifications is vague. However, this criterion was used to judge aspects related to the contractor' firm and not related to the experience of key personnel. To be more specific, Criterion 4: Skills/Other qualifications should read:</p>
<p>4. Skills / Other Qualification (20 points)<br />&bull;	The contractor' firm must justify having carried out at least one project in africa or in a developing country (10 points)<br />&bull;	The contractor' firm must have a duration of existence of :<br />o	between 1 and 5 years (5 points)<br />o	greater than 5 years (10 points)</p>
<p>5. Section 2.11 of the RFP states:"All proposal documents shall be prepared and submitted in English and in French."<br />Furthermore, the TOR states as follows: "All deliverables shall be delivered in both English and French. All workshops and meetings indicated in the TOR shall be arranged with the approval of the Grantee. The Grantee shall provide space for all meetings and workshops. Meetings and workshops shall be conducted in French unless otherwise requested by the Grantee." In addition, in accordance with the Nationality Requirements, nationals of only the U.S. and Cote D'Ivoire may be used with the further restriction that only 20% of the budget may be used for Ivorian nationals. In view the above requirements and the fact that most U.S. companies (except for a few rather large businesses) with the expertise required to complete the TA generally do not have native French speakers, USTDA, the Grantee may not get sufficient number of proposals and that the competition will be extremely limited to a few companies.<br />Question 5.1: Would USTDA consider allowing U.S. firms to engage the services of consultants and firms from other countries, e.g., France, Belgium, and Canada for an addition 20-30% of the budget? <br />Answer 5.1: No, we cannot consider third country nationals.<br />Question 5.2: Alternatively, would USTDA consider increasing the 20% limit for Ivorian nationals to 50% for nationals of Cote D'Ivoire and other West African countries? <br />Answer 5.2: USTDA can consider increasing the percentage of the budget used for Ivoirian national if a compelling case is made. Please note that it is unlikely USTDA would raise it much above 30-35 percent.</p>
<p>6. Section 3.5: Experience and Qualifications states as follows: "The Offeror shall provide information with respect to relevant experience and qualifications of key staff proposed. The Offeror shall include letters of commitment from the individuals proposed confirming their availability for contract performance."<br />Question 6.1: The first part of this statement requires the Offeror to provide information about key staff. The RFP does not define "key staff". Can the offeror determine who they believe are key staff? <br />Answer 6.1: The key staff are the required positions that are listed (e.g. Project Leader, Electrical Engineer/ Power Systems Analysis Expert).<br />Question 6.2: The second part of above statement requires letters of commitment from the individuals proposed. Are letters of commitment required only from the key staff or all staff proposed? <br />Answer 6.2: Letters of commitment are only necessary for key staff (i.e. the listed positions).</p>
<p>7. With respect to the schedule for the TA, the RFP states as follows: "The maximum duration of implementation for the TA is expected to be twelve (12) months."<br />Question : In Section 4: Award Criteria, the second criterion Project Approach is allocated 30 points of the total 100 points. Of this, 10 points are allocated to "Schedule". Would you clarify exactly what the RFP is looking for from prospective bidders in the area of "schedule" which has one-third of the total 30 points allocated to "Project Approach"? <br />Answer: The Grantee would like to see a proposed schedule for delivering the TOR, including proposed dates for completion for each deliverable, the timing of the workshops etc. For example, a Gantt chart and accompanied description of the timeline/schedule would be appropriate.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to answer Vendor submitted questions.

QUESTION 1:  Will a 12L water bath be acceptable for the application, instead of the called for 10L water bath? 


ANSWER:  YES

QUESTION 2:  Will a 18L water bath be acceptable for the application, instead of the called for 20L water bath?

ANSWER:  YES

QUESTION 3:  Will a 26L water bath be acceptable for the application, instead of the called for 28L water bath?

ANSWER:  YES


QUESTION 4:  We are a VOSB trying to understand how the  rule of two  is applied in solicitations. Would you be willing to clarify something about your response below?
 The  Rule of Two  analysis showed that there are not enough interested SDVOSB/VOSB or SB manufacturers that responded to our RFI that could fulfill this requirement, and that there are not enough interested SDVOSB/VOSB distributors that have compatible products from two or more SB original equipment manufacturers capable of meeting the requirement,  
How does the determination that lack of SDVOSB/VOSB manufacturers able to fulfill the requirement satisfy the rule of two? From what I m able to find about this rule, there is no distinction between manufacturers and suppliers. 
38 U.S.C. 8127(d) states that a contracting officer of the VA,  shall award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans will submit offers and that the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.  


ANSWER:  Absent a non-manufacture waiver, when a solicitation is set-aside for a SDVOSB or VOSB concern the requirements of VAAR Clause 852.219-10VA Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside or 852.219-11 VA Notice of Total Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside must be met. These clauses require that any concern submitting a bid or offer in its own name, other than on a construction or service contract, that proposes to furnish an end product it did not manufacture (a  nonmanufacturer ), is a small business if it has no more than 500 employees, and furnishes in the performance of the contract, the product of a small business manufacturer. The end product furnished must be manufactured or produced in the United States or its outlying areas. The term  nonmanufacturer  includes a concern that can, but elects not to, manufacture or produce the end product for the specific acquisition. For size determination purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end product being acquired. The manufacturer of the end product being acquired is the concern that, with its own forces, transforms inorganic or organic substances including raw materials and/or miscellaneous parts or components into the end product.

<DESC>This is an award notice for an administrative modification assoicated with the 12-month Base Telecommunications Services bridge contarct. The administrative modification corrected pricing mistakes that were included in the basic contract's attachments. <br /><br />IAW FAR 5.705(b), because the basic contract was awarded without competition, this administrative modification must be synopsized. Further information detailing the reasoning behind the lack of competition can be found below. The following explanation was included in the postaward synopsis of the basic award, FA8501-18-F-0175.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">"12 months of Base Telecommunications Services for Robins AFB from SMS Data Products, Inc in the form of an urgent bridge contract. This award was made as an order off of the NETCENTS-1 NetOps and Infrastructure Solutions Small Business (SB) Contract, in accordance with the policy memorandum from AF SAE and AF CIO dated 15 September 2014, and in accordance with AFI 33-112. The NETCENTS-2 contracts are the mandatory source for all Air Force units purchasing NetCentric IT products and services that fall witin scope of the contracts. This award was made in a sole-source fashion to SMS Data Products Group, Inc. under the proceedings of FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency. This award is a short-term bridge contract that was awarded due to SMS Data Products, Inc. due to the previous contract suddenly falling through. The current contractor, which was awarded FA8501-17-F-0144 in 2017 notified the government of their refusal to perform past the base year of the contract, which ended on 15 September 2018, with too little time left to be able to perform a full and open competitive source selection award. The requirement was deemed urgent and a sole-source bridge contract was approved IAW attached Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity, dated 1 August 2018.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Due to the urgency of this requirement and a backlog of work orders caused by the actions of the current</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">contractor, it was determined that only small business sources with prior positive award performance history for</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">the BTS system at Robins AFB would be considered for this urgent bridge action. Following a market research</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">investigation, SMS was chosen for this effort due to their being clearly capable to fulfill the government's</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">requirements, as well as them being a prior bridge incumbent for BTS services with Robins AFB with a positivelyreflected CPARS. The importance of the incoming contractor to perform immediately, taking on the transition of work from the previous contractor, was extremely important in preventing a lapse of coverage. Therefore, award to any other source without experience or a positive, proven procurement history record associated with the Robins BTS system was determined to pose too much inherent risk to the government. (Please see attached Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity, dated 1 August 2018, for further details.)</span></p>

In 2015, the FRA with support of the Volpe Center reinitiated research activities to address outstanding items recommended for fire safety research from the 1999 and 2002 rule-making activities. JENSEN HUGHES investigated the feasibility of using heat release rate criteria to evaluate fire performance of materials, review adequacy of existing industry standards for fire safety of wires and cables, and to investigate alternative methods for the floor fire barrier test. JENSEN HUGHES developed fire dynamics simulation model that was validated with data from small-scale and room corner tests. This research effort will finalize the modeling and conduct tests to provide technical justification for the proposed HRR performance test criteria as an alternative acceptance parameter to that of existing flammability and smoke emission test criteria, as found in &sect;238.103 Appendix B. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>JENSEN HUGHES' current expertise and research progress gained in the past 18 months makes then uniquely qualified for a sole source contract to continue the research. A new contractor will need 3-6 months to get familiarized with the research and to begin working on the current tasks to be funded. This is time lost in getting the research results out to the passenger rail industry for update of current fire safety standards. The FRA intends to present the results to the National Fire Protection Association 130 Committee on Fire Protection for Guided Railway in support of updating the standards.</span></p>

The study found that as well as the standards and regulations varying around the world, the reference basis also changed. This complicates the comparison of standards. However, noise theory could be applied to convert the various global standards to a common reference. This research effort to develop an analysis tool and a common reference comparison of the global standards and regulations would be a very beneficial addition to report for the Industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As well as identifying the respective standards and regulations, 50-60 noise mitigation options were identified.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This experimental work is a continuation of research and development begun under FRA Contract # DTFR53-17-C-00005 awarded to Pavemetrics Systems, Inc. The objective of this next project is to continue software development and to extend the field testing of automated change detection technology to revenue track segments to demonstrate the system's efficacy for automated detection of safety-related changes in the track structure and surrounding areas along the right-of-way. This project directly supports FRA mission to develop innovative safety technologies to ensure the safe and efficient operation of railroads. The primary outcome of the proposed project will be a more realistic assessment of the potential value of deploying change detection technology under typical field inspection conditions. It is expected that this testing will also further refine the change detection algorithms that were developed in the initial project. All field work will be conducted in partnership with Amtrak engineering.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">There are many sources for track inspection measurement and machine vision technologies in the railroad industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These commercially available systems are designed to detect and measure characteristics and features of track systems and to report this information in a quantitative manner. All similar systems require human decision making to function. These systems are not appropriate for this research. FRA seeks a system that automatically detect changes without direct human involvement. In addition, these changes are not necessarily measurable, the results cannot always be quantified. To modify these existing systems would require a wholesale re-design effort. This effort would add cost to the research above the cost of working within the capabilities of Pavemetrics. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Moreover, Pavemtrics' 3D laser triangulation hardware is unique and provides added resolution to the track system that is not available from sources of traditional inspection and/or machine vision technologies. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>FRA feels that this sole source, fixed-price approach provides the best value to the Government.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The United States Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Acquisition Services, under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the National Academy of Science's (NAS) Transportation Research Board (TRB) to provide services for the requirement titled "2018 Biennial Peer Review and Evaluation of FRA's R&amp;D Program."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is fully qualified and capable of conducting the Peer Review and Evaluation of FRA's R&amp;D Program and has been successfully conducting this program since 2010. TRB is the only entity with the capability of carrying out this program because it is an independent non-profit entity that has no affiliation with railroad providers, manufacturers, or suppliers. This makes TRB a unique organization for being fully independent, with no bias on behalf of any organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the Senate Appropriations Committee subsequently asked that TRB extend the scope of the peer review to include the R&amp;D program, which focuses on research in support of safety regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The reputation enjoyed by TRB has enabled it to establish a distinguished committee composed of a diversified group of experts in the railroad field, to conduct the peer review and evaluation of the R&amp;D program.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The long established status of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) as a noncompetitive source of scientific research and policy advice to the Government derives from its creation by Congress in 1863 (36 U.S.C. Sec. 253). This special status and relationship with the Government was reconfirmed by E.O. 2859, May 11, 1918, as amended by E.O. 10668, May 10, 1956. The noncompetitive status of the NAS was most recently formally recommended in E.O. 12832 on January 19, 1993. This order cites the special relationship of the Academy to Government and its unique capacity to martial scientific expertise of the highest caliber in order to provide independent and objective science policy advice. The NAS has the unique ability to assemble the Nation's most eminent scholars, who serve as volunteers without compensation on committees and boards, which are then able to render advice and guidance of the highest quality and unparalleled objectivity to address national problems of high priority. Accordingly, only NAS can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity and audience acceptance necessary to meet our program requirements.</span></p>
