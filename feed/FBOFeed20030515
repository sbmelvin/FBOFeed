Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed price or not-to-exceed type task orders.  The maximum ordering limitation will be $25,000,000.00 for the life of the contract.  Each task order will not exceed $500,000.00.  The $25,000,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread over the life of the contract including all option years.  The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $50,000.00.   SUSTAINABLE DESIGN  The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities.  Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. EXECUTIVE ORDER  In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement.   PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED  For the purpose of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily: A)	Project Planning and Compliance Services B)	Predesign Services: a)	Programming b)	Site Analysis c)	Supplementary Services C)	Design Services: a) Schematic Design b) Value Analysis c) Design Development d) Construction Documents e) Construction Support D) Construction Management Services COORDINATION The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.   SPECIALIZED SERVICES  In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the DSC occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the Denver Service Center will continue to acquire such specialized services.   The DSC does not intend to allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on subconsultant's services.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance:   A)	Demonstrated ability and experience to work nationwide, including U. S. possessions and territories, in the type of projects required under this contract, particularly small projects, in various climatic regions (i.e. high mountain, heavy snow areas, arid deserts and coastal, urban and remote areas); and specific past performance records on previous architect/engineering work performed for federal, state, and local government agencies, and private industry documenting the quality of the firm's work and the firm's history of meeting performance schedules and budgets.

The lead firm(s) selected for contract award will be predominately an architecture and engineering firm specializing in contemporary and/or historic architecture and landscape architecture. In order to maximize competition, the National Park Service is encouraging joint venture arrangements as well as prime/subcontractor relationships for this solicitation. Familiarity with the "Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Archeology and Historic Preservation" and the related "Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties", and the "Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for the Treatment of Cultural Landscapes" as well as sensitivity to NPS values, standards, and sustainable design principles must be demonstrated. The Government may elect to award a single task order contract or multiple task order contracts to one or more sources under this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award contracts, based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference, to the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work.  Each selected firm shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued.  The Government will use such factors as experience, qualifications, past performance, environmental sensitivity, quality of deliverables, timeliness, geographic location, and other factors (i.e., knowledge of local construction practices, natural and cultural compliance, permitting, capability to utilize construction/project management software for timeline scheduling, etc.) that the Contracting Officer, in the exercise of sound business judgment, believes are relevant to the placement of orders.  TYPES OF PROJECTS Projects may include but are not limited to research, inventory, stabilization, preservation, and rehabilitation of historic structures, site planning and design, and cultural landscapes or design for interpreted structures, museums, visitor/interpretive centers, administrative facilities, maintenance facilities, single family housing, campgrounds, roads, and parking. REQUIRED DISCIPLINES:   A) Required disciplines include, but are not limited to, professionals registered as architects and landscape architects, and professionals meeting the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards for Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Historic Architecture, Architectural History, and History, Architectural Conservation, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Geotechnical and Structural Engineering, and Sustainable Technologies. B) Additional disciplines which may be required for some projects include professionals registered in, or meeting the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards for (as appropriate), Historic Landscape Architecture, Landscape History, Archeology, Anthropology, Surveying, Industrial Hygiene, Construction Management, Cost Control/Cost Estimating, and Exhibitry/Media Design. C) Incidental services, e.g., AutoCAD drafting and 3D modeling, GIS, Microsoft Word processing, etc., may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements. CONTRACT PERIOD All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract. The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed price or not-to-exceed type task orders.  The maximum ordering limitation will be $25,000,000.00 for the life of the contract.  Each task order will not exceed $500,000.00.  The $25,000,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread out over the life of the contract including all option years.  The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $50,000.00.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of Government facilities.  Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices.   EXECUTIVE ORDER  In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement. PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED For the purpose of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily Research, Inventory, (Project Planning and Compliance Services), Programming and Site Analysis, and Supplemental Services (Pre Design Services), Design and Construction Documents (Design Services) and Construction Management (Construction Management Services). All professionals shall be registered in the States in which the work is performed. A)	Project Planning And Compliance Services:         1.  Research and   2.  Inventory; B)	Pre-Design Services:  1.

COORDINATION The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.   SPECIALIZED SERVICES In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the DSC occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the Denver Service Center will continue to acquire such specialized services.  The DSC does not intend to allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on subconsultant's services.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria for contemporary/historic architecture and landscape architecture, listed in descending order of importance: 1.

<DESC>Extended Safety of Once Daily Oral Tenofovir for HIV Prevention Among High-Risk Men who have Sex with Men
      
A. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND PURPOSE:    

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with antiretroviral agents (ART) has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of HIV seroconversion after occupational exposures, and there is evidence to suggest that PEP may also reduce the risk after sexual exposures.  The purpose of this project is to determine whether ART taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis (ie., before a sexual exposure occurs) is safe on a long-term basis.  The agent chosen for the study is Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) which is taken once daily and which has a strong safety and efficacy profile when used as a therapeutic agent.  This study will be done in coordination with an independently sponsored trial that will examine the safety and efficacy of this agent among heterosexual women in Africa and Asia. Participants in this study will be randomized to receive either TDF or its placebo and will be followed for any adverse effects of the agent, any changes in their sexual behavior, and HIV incidence.  Results of this study will determine whether TDF is safe and acceptable for long-term use among men who have sex with men (MSM), whether such use might affect participants sexual behavior, and whether such use should be further investigated to demonstrate efficacy in preventing HIV acquisition among high-risk MSM.

B. BACKGROUND AND NEED:   

The HIV epidemic is continuing to grow and the predominant mode of transmission worldwide is sexual.  Sexual abstinence or consistent and correct condom use are the only methods currently recommended for prevention of sexually transmitted HIV yet many at-risk persons are either unwilling or unable to remain abstinent or to use condoms with every sexual act.  An effective, easy to use method of prevention is urgently needed.  Topical microbicides are being developed in hopes of offering at-risk persons a method to protect themselves from infection when condom use is not possible.  However, no microbicide candidate has shown effective protection from HIV in human trials.

Ever since the development of the first antiretroviral agents, the potential of ART to prevent HIV acquisition has been explored.  Non-perinatal studies have looked at ART given as post-exposure prophylaxis, i.e., after a person has been exposed to HIV.  PEP was shown to dramatically decrease the risk of HIV seroconversion among persons who had been occupationally exposed.  Similarly, even though no definitive human studies of the efficacy of PEP for sexual HIV exposures exist, much animal and anecdotal evidence suggest that it may reduce the risk of transmission, and many healthcare providers currently offer it to persons who experience isolated exposures.  PEP appears to have varying degrees of effectiveness depending on how long after the exposure it is given. This has raised the question of whether ART would be even more effective and potentially able to be used by greater numbers of at-risk persons if it were to be used before the exposure takes place, ie., as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP).  Given the continued growth of the HIV epidemic and the relative lack of HIV prevention options, the concept of using a daily oral antiretroviral to prevent HIV transmission merits further exploration and testing.  

As noted above, condoms and potential topical microbicides require consistent and correct use during every coital act.  This is similar to the situation when barrier methods were the most common forms of nonpermanent contraception.  However, when hormonal oral contraceptives were introduced and the preventive method became disassociated with coitus, contraception became easier, popular, and more effective at the individual and population level.  TDF has been selected for investigation as chemoprophylaxis against HIV in high-risk individuals because of its unique pharmacologic profile.  In addition to TDFs convenience of being a once daily single tablet with a safety profile comparable to placebo among HIV infected persons, it has striking anti-HIV potency and a low potential for selection of resistant viruses.  Each of these properties is necessary given the realities of the intended target populations.  Moreover, initial prevention studies in simian models have provided encouraging results.  

An independently funded study is currently in the planning stages for an expanded safety and efficacy study of TDF among sexually active heterosexual women in Africa and Asia.  Another population that is most likely to eventually use HIV chemoprophylaxis should it be proven to be safe and effective would be high-risk MSM, and thus it is imperative to determine in parallel with this international study whether TDF is safe for use by men.  Of note, the public health policy issues associated with the use of oral HIV chemoprophylaxis may be substantially different for MSM as compared to heterosexual women in the developing world.  As an example, there is concern that the potential for increased risk behavior may be greater for MSM.  The availability of an oral agent may induce some men to switch from the most effective prevention method (condoms) to one that is less effective (TDF).  It is likely that TDF may be highly effective against HIV (i.e., > 80%) but it has no efficacy against other sexually transmitted infections (STI) such as syphilis and gonorrhea.  Modeling exercises have indicated that the availability of a less-effective method but which is used more often can result in a large decrease in HIV transmission.  However, decreases in transmission of HIV would need to be considered in the context of the potential for increased transmission of other serious, although generally non-fatal STI.

<DESC>Responses to this announcement are sought to demonstrate and increase high-speed flight capabilities and performance for expendable supersonic vehicles. RATTLRS is a joint project between the Navy, Air Force, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and potentially other government agencies.  There are two aspects to this project. The first, RATTLRS Flight Demonstration Project (RATTLRS FDP) includes concept studies, design, development, fabrication and test of flight vehicles.  The goal of the RATTLRS FDP is to conduct at least three demonstration flights, with the first flight thirty-six (36) to thirty-eight (38) months after contract award, and the project completed forty-eight (48) months after award. The second aspect is the optional RATTLRS Technology Development Project (TDP), focused towards developing and maturing technologies for inclusion in potential future high-speed flight demonstrations. The potential for additional flight demonstrations depends upon risk reduction, technology development rationale and funding availability.  Please see the attached document for full BAA announcement and requirements.  The BAA is also available at the ONR website www.onr.navy.mil/02/baa/.

<CONTACT>John Evans, DARPA Program Manager, MTO, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-248-1808, Email jevans@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of 3-D Micro Electromagnetic Radio Frequency Systems (3-D MERFS).  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  DARPA seeks innovative proposals related to the development and demonstration of three-dimensional printed circuit board technologies that will enable complete system- or sub-system-level design and integration of RF and MMW systems. Of particular interest are applications of these technologies to beam formers for vehicle-mounted multi-function Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) radar (36 GHz) and communications (38 GHz) systems; beam-formers for low-cost man-portable or vehicle-mounted satellite uplinks/downlinks (44 GHz / 20 GHz); beam-formers and antennas for 95 GHz missile seeker systems; and beam-formers and antennas for 95 GHz, lightweight, low-probability-of-detection, low-probability-of-intercept repeaters.  Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-27 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.  PROGRAM SCOPE:  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site -- http://teaming.sysplan.com/MERFS/ -- has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr. John D. Evans, fax:  (703) 248-1808.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled BAA 03-27, 3-D Microelectromagnetic Radio Frequency Systems, Proposer Information Pamphlet which provides further information on 3-D Micro Electromagnetic Radio Frequency Systems, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  An original and seven (7) copies of the proposal abstract and two electronic copies (i.e. two separate disks) of the abstract (in PDF -preferred, MS-Word readable, HTML, or ASCII format each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM) should be submitted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-27, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The proposal abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-27) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Tuesday, June 17, 2003.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original and seven  (7) copies of the full proposal and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF - preferred, MS-Word readable, HTML, or ASCII format, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM). Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 03-27, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 03-27) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Tuesday, August 12, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 03-27 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation is soliciting proposals for utility, medium-lift, fixed-wing flight services from ski-equipped DeHavilland DHC-6 Twin Otter or equivalent aircraft to support its polar research programs; i.e., the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), and the National Science Foundations Arctic Program.  The USAP is this nations national program of scientific research in Antarctica, and includes the activities of NSF and other U.S. Government agencies.  NSF is one of many U.S. Government agencies conducting scientific research in the Arctic.  NSF sponsored researchers have conducted research activities in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Russia, and within Scandinavia, often in cooperation with institutions and researchers in those countries and regions.

In the Antarctic, operations will be staged primarily from McMurdo Station, Antarctica, employing a hub-and-spoke operational design.  Annually, approximately nine hundred flight hours over a ninety-four day exclusive use period, from early November through early February of the following year, are planned.  Flights to and from U.S. and other national program bases, field camps, and/or various research stations within Antarctica will be scheduled.  Search and rescue missions, and operations for extended periods from locations other than McMurdo Station are also required.  All labor, aircraft equipment (except for certain support equipment) and materials necessary to operate and maintain a three aircraft fleet will be contractor furnished, including full spares package, and field equipment (e.g., cargo nets, tie-down straps, tool kit, and survival kit, and other consumables).  The Government will supply berthing, meals, fuel, and certain support equipment.  

In the Arctic, flight services requirements are intermittent, and may be required at any time of the year.  Services are occasionally required in Alaska, but the most concentrated effort is support of ocean sampling sites in a broad region between the Canadian Forces Station Alert and the North Pole.  This work occurs for several weeks duration between March and May of each year and involves transportation of science teams and their equipment between sea ice field sites.  In Greenland the work occurs throughout the year but mostly between May and August, and involves ferrying field teams to and around the Greenland Ice Cap.  The contractor will provide all labor, aircraft and field equipment, materials, fuel, supplies, and consumables.  Approximately one hundred-fifty flight hours annually are anticipated.

As noted, the primary role for the aircraft in both theaters of operation will be for utility transportation services, ferrying personnel and materials to remote, often unprepared, field locations.  However, at least one of the aircraft will be configured with a downward-looking port, wing hard-points and in-wing cable raceways to allow the aircraft to be used for remote sensing activities to include: aerogeophysical surveys, aerial photography, LIDAR and remote digital mapping, and the operation of ice-penetrating radar systems.  An additional special requirement will be the ability to fly a towed (cable-deployed) magnetometer for aeromagnetic surveys.

This acquisition is unrestricted.  NSF anticipates publishing the RFP on May 30, 2003.  A pre-proposal conference is tentatively planned for early or mid-June.  Details will be published in the solicitation.  Proposals are due on July 3, 2003.  Contract award is expected prior to December 23, 2003, with an effective date of January 15, 2004.  A fixed price contract, with a 45-day phase-in period, and a core performance period of 36 months is contemplated, with four award term incentives of 12 months each.  The total performance period, including award term incentives, is 85.5 months.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; price quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is DTCG23-03-B-TMX003.

The period of  performance for the base period is twelve months from date of award, with four (4) one (1) year options. The contract type will be a firm fixed price. The U.S. Coast Guard has  a requirement to implement various telecommunications projects to improve voice and data connectivity to Coast Guard cutters.   The U. S.

This acquisition is to acquire services for all INMARSAT Mini-M terminals throughout the Coast Guard.  INMARSAT is a commercial maritime satellite communications system. The Mini-M terminals will use the
     INMARSAT network for operational voice and data communications.  The Coast Guard also requires STU-III secure  voice communications over this system.  Your proposals should be sent to the following address:  Commandant,

The data collected belongs to the Rhode Island DOT and they are under no obligation to make it available to the general public.  As the states consultant, GTR has full access to the data and site.  It is essential to this study that the contractor who installed the instrumentation and collected the data be responsible for the data reduction and analysis.  It would not be technically feasible for any other contractor to conduct this study.  Because of GTRs unique qualifications and experience they are the only known source that can provide the required service.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about May 29, 2003.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification for the Systems Engineering and Management Integration  (SEMI) support of the Tactical Tomahawk transition, from an EMD program to a production program.  The Contractor shall provide non-core Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS) systems engineering and program management support under the direction of PMA-280, as needed to resolve emergent issues associated with all TWS segments related to the transition from EMD to production.  Efforts include, but are not limited to, engineering assessments and trade studies, update TWS System Specification (JCM-2142), update the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), verify system level performance requirements/verification traces on TWS changes, and support the accreditation of specific updates to the TWS models and simulations database required due to system changes.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  Since that time, Raytheon has also been the sole contractor providing SEMI support to the Tomahawk Systems Engineering Organization (SEO). This makes Raytheon the only company capable of performing this work.  In addition, RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tactical Tomahawk missile, and the interface documentation needed to assess the impacts of missile changes to all TWS segments.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile and the TWS is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<CONTACT>Elaine Flick Contracting Officer 3032363528     Elaine_Flick@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Amarillo Field Office has a requirement for a follow-on contract for engineering services to conduct on-going engineering evaluations and studies of a 310-Bcf gas storage reservoir that contains approximately 31 Bcf of injected Government and privately owned helium in a partially depleted natural gas field approximately 15 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas.  The original contract, NAR020100, was a small business set-aside, awarded to NITEC, LLC of Denver Colorado, on June 27, 2002.  Under contract NAC020100, NITEC, LLC performed an engineering study to (1) determine the validity of using the bhp/z vs. cumulative production curve to determine ultimate, recoverable reserves; (2) estimated the structure and volume of the reservoir; and (3) developed a model and simulation of the reservoir using off-the-shelf and customized computer software products.  NITEC, LLC reviewed prior engineering reports, available pressure tests, deliverability tests, production and injection volumes and related gas compositions.  From this, NITEC, LLC developed a material balance equation that confirmed the reserve volumes used by the BLM.  Much of this work would have to be repeated, at extra time and cost, by any new consultant before starting the history match phase of reservoir simulation.  Additionally, NITEC, LLC analyzed the available geological data, the Brown Dolomite, and completed structure maps for the Brown Dolomite.  Much of the geophysical analysis was completed using proprietary software.  All of the logs and core data for the field were analyzed, and then the results used to quantify the extent and characteristics of natural fracturing.  Pressure build-up tests were evaluated to tie performance based reservoir permeability to that obtained from cores.  Any other consultant would have to repeat much of the above work, at extra time and cost, before even beginning a simulation.  For the above-stated reasons, the circumstances permitting other than full and open competition as cited in 41 U.S.C.253(c)(2), and FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" are germaine to this procurement.  This statutory authority applies as a follow-on contract awarded to anyone other than NITEC, LLC would result in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  As such, the BLM intends to award a firm-fixed price, not-to-exceed, labor hour contract, sole source, to NITEC, LLC, for the follow-on effort described above.  Questions regarding this procurement may be directed to Elaine E. Flick, the Contracting Officer, at 303-236-3528.  See Note 22!

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source procurement on or about May 30, 2003 with Evrogen JSC, Moscow, Russia for providing custom cDNA forward and reverse subtraction library services.  The period of performance shall be within  seven to eleven weeks from date of award.  EPA believes that Evrogen is the only source capable of providing the required services because Evrogen JSC provides a service known as Mirror Orientation Selection (MOS), which reduces background in the selection of clones and results in less duplication  and better representation of unique clones.  FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" permits other than full and open competition.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no  solicitation (Request for Quotations) is available.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability for consideration by the agency within 15 days of this notice to: U.S. EPA, Attn: Barbara Nelson  (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy this requirement.  Responses shall also  include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine that competition is feasible, a purchase order will be placed with Evrogen JSC.

NIST requires expert services to generate a suite of tools and samples for the IPC supply chain communications standards to facilitate the adoption and implementation of these standards.   The required tasks are as follows:  TASK 1: Provide and maintain a robust PDX website to serve as the definitive PDX resource for the industry to include source code for the PDX parser and sample PDX files. Provide a web interface to submit sample PDX files to a parser for evaluation and provide simple report describing the validity of the syntax of the document.  TASK 2: Provide a freely available web-based registry of PDX users and suppliers.  TASK 3: NEMI/IPC 2577 - Finalize committee work and shepherd specification through standardization.  Ensure that IPC 2577 is integrated with the most current version of related RosettaNet Partner Interface Process specifications, costing, workflow, and problem reporting based on industry requirements.  Arrange for finalized vote on standard.  TASK 4: Support PDX public free-forum and committee meetings. TASK 5: Write a semantic parser for IPC 2571/2576/2578 and publish the software on the new revised web site. TASK 6: Write a syntax checker and parser for the finalized version of the IPC 2577 specification. The checker shall be written in Java, and the source code shall be provided to the NIST COTR. The tools shall also be made available via Georgia Tech Research Corporation website.   The Georgia Tech Research Corporation is actively involved in the development and adoption of several key IPC 25XX series of standards.  It possesses in-house expertise in PDX IPC-2571, IPC-2578 and IPC-2577.  It is a key participant in the National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative's Plug and Play Factory Project and possesses state of the art facilities and equipment in its Advanced Electronics Assembly Laboratory.   A firm fixed price purchase order will be issued for one year.  This notice of intent is not a request for competition; no solicitation is available, however, interested parties may express, in writing, their interest and document their bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  Such information will be reviewed only to determine if it is necessary to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Information Technology Support Center (ITSC) of the Indian Health Service (IHS) located in Albuquerque, New Mexico is seeking capability statements from potential sources on the development of informational documentation, visual aids and/or other media to assist ITSC staff, IHS Area Office staff, IHS HQ negotiators and Tribal negotiators to better understand the support services offered by the ITSC to American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes seeking to contract or compact ITSC Information Technology (IT) services. The effort is to assist Tribes or Tribal organizations in the decision making process that relates to their best business practices.  

The IHS, a Department of Health and Human Services Agency, is responsible for providing health services to federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments. The IHS is the principal federal health care provider for 55% of the estimated 2.4 million Indian people and provides limited health services to more than 150,000 Indians living in 34 cities.

Sovereignty provides tribes their self-governing status. Self-determination and self-governance have important meaning to tribes and effect how their health services are delivered. Public Law 93-638, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, provides that tribes can redesign their health programs if they choose to compact and/or contract under the provisions of the Act. This authority provides that IHS will transfer its resources to tribes so that they can administer their own health programs if they decide to do so. Almost 44 percent of the Agencys $2.9 billion budget is transferred to tribes through funds referred to as tribal shares. The Agency retains the remaining tribal shares and delivers health services directly to the tribes that do not choose to administer their own programs. Tribes that choose to operate their own health care facilities can elect to leave funding with the IHS for selected operational functions e.g. computer operations and telecommunications. In this case, IHS would retain a portion of their funding (shares) and provide the tribes computer and database operations and telecommunications support.

The ITSC provides nationwide support for the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), an administrative, clinical software system supporting operations in over 400 IHS health centers and tribally operated health centers operating under P.L. 93-638 contracts or compacts. ITSC also supports a national database of information related to patient visits to IHS and tribally run health centers and is responsible for installation and support of a nationwide voice and data telecommunications network to support IHS nation-wide operations. Tribes can elect to take their shares to operate and maintain RPMS or other available systems or applications themselves, or leave shares (retain with IHS) for ITSC to support.  Likewise, Tribes can elect to operate their own telecommunications system or leave shares (retain with IHS) for ITSC to provide telecommunications support. The four major support categories that tribes can elect to operate or leave shares for ITSC to support are:
A.	Software Development and Maintenance Services ( RPMS)
B.	Telecommunications Management Services
C.	National Database Services (to statistically evaluate tribal patient visits for budget and workload accounting)
D.	Systems support and training (maintenance of hardware running RPMS, and RPMS applications training).

Annually, negotiators from the IHSs twelve Area offices meet with those Tribes that are approved for compacting/contracting to determine the amount of tribal shares to be retained by an IHS Area Office or by the HQ managed fund (ITSC) to provide Information Technology support. Tribes or Tribal organizations can elect to leave shares (shares to be retained by the IHS) for none, a portion of, or all of the functions listed above.  The effort is to provide compacting/contracting Tribes or Tribal organizations the option of utilizing IHS IT support; to contract out; or to support internally.

ITSC is requesting support in the development of informational documentation, visual aids and/or other media that will assist in the negotiation process to assure that IHS and Tribal negotiators understand the complexity and expense of supporting and maintaining computer systems, applications and related technologies. The informational documentation, visual aids and/or other media may be developed from existing ITSC documentation. 

Contractors who meet the total small business and requirements of this pre-solicitation sources sought announcement are requested to submit their qualification statements to Diego G. Lujan, Contracting Officer, Albuquerque Area Indian Health Service, 5300 Homestead Road N.E., Albuquerque, New Mexico  87110 or e-mail your statements to dlujan@abq.ihs.gov by close of business on June 13, 2003.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract for Systems Engineering, Management and Integration (SEMI) support for the PMA-280 Tomahawk Systems Engineering Organization (SEO).   This effort will include support for the baseline Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS), Tactical Tomahawk and other planned TWS improvements.  This contract will provide program management and systems engineering services needed by the Tomahawk SEO to support all TWS segments.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Company, Missile Systems Business Unit (RMS), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR) and also RMS has been the sole contractor supporting the Tomahawk SEO exclusively for the resolution of Tomahawk system wide engineering issues.  Raytheon currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapon System.  They possess the required knowledge and documentation necessary to integrate new technologies into the AUR, and to assess their impacts to the entire TWS.  Because detailed knowledge of, and experience with, all segments of the Tomahawk Weapon System is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.  The estimated period of performance is from October 2003 through September 2004 with a potential for a one-year extension.  Any questions to this synopsis should be sent via email to newfieldce@navair.navy.mil or spiottaml@navair.navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Cancer Information Products and Systems (CIPS) plans to procure a system license and related support services from the Coalition of National Cancer Cooperative Groups, Inc., Philadelphia, PA. The NCI, as part of its mission, provides information about cancer clinical trials to medical professionals and patients in the United States and elsewhere. This is accomplished through the NCI PDQ (Physician Data Query)  system, which is a comprehensive cancer database containing peer-reviewed information summaries on cancer treatment, screening, prevention, genetics, and supportive care.  It also contains a registry of cancer clinical trials from around the world and directories of physicians, other health professionals, and organizations involved in cancer care.  The purpose of this procurement is to obtain a license and related services for TrialCheck, which is a query system owned and operated by the above-mentioned vendor.  TrialCheck will be used to expand clinical trial search functionality for trials listed in the PDQ database.  The proposed interface is unique in its ability to narrow clinical trial searches by patient eligibility criteria.  The system and services are considered commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  The Coalition is the only organization known that has the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement.  This statement must demonstrate that the proposed system is currently in place and operating on the Web.  The NCI will not consider statements that propose to develop a new system.  It must also list trials as specified.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) anticipates the award of a three-year contract to further develop the independent media in BiH by: (1) improving the legal, regulatory, and policy environment, (2) enhancing the business development of selected media outlets, (3) strengthening newsroom management, journalistic standards, and the effective use of research and analysis in decision making, and (4) supporting the increased domestic production of media products.  Over the period of the tree-year contract, the Contractor will steadily and deliberately phase itself out of the sector by working closely with local NGO partners and at the end of the contract merging or transferring activities to its local partner(s).  at the conclusion of the contract, the final deliverables will be the presence and effective operation of a nationwide local organization(s) that conduct ongoing training and technical assistance to local media outlets as they move toward financial sustainability.  USAID intends to make one (1) award under the solicitation to the most responsible firm/organization whose proposal offers the best value to the Government. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541840. The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov) no sooner than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is Amendment No. 1 to solicitation (RFQ) number CON-03-0016.  This amendment is issued to: 1) change the city location of one focus group for CLIN 2;  2) provide the composition of 4th focus group for CLIN 2;  3) change the Delivery Schedule; and 4) furnish answers to questions raised from prospective offerors.  The due date for receipt of proposals has not been extended.  The due date remains Wednesday, May 21, 2003 no later than 3:00p.m. (EST).

1)  The city location of the focus group for CLIN 2 has be changed from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to  Kuwait City, Kuwait.  2)  The composition of the 4th focus group for CLIN 2 is females ages 18-29.  3) The Delivery Schedule is changed to read as follows:  (a) Focus Groups work for CLIN 2 should commence the week of June 23, 2003.  (b) Focus Groups for CLIN 1 may be conducted during a subsequent time period (but not later than the end of July 2003).  Exact timing of all focus groups will be agreed upon subsequent to contract award.  Final report to be submitted no later than 3 weeks after conclusion of the final focus group.  4) Answers to questions received from prospective offerors are as follows.  The questions are labeled followed by the BBG answer. (Q1): I saw that both radio and TV focus groups are to be completed in Cairo and Amman.  Would I be correct in assuming that these groups are separate?  In other words, radio and TV ads will not be tested in the same focus group, correct?  (A1):  Yes, the radio and TV focus groups will be separate.  (Q2): CLIN 2. FOR TELEVISION STUDIES: A total of 16 Focus Groups shall be conducted for this project, in the following cities:  Cairo, Egypt; Amman, Jordan; Casablanca, Morocco; and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Focus Groups composition in each city shall be as follows: one male group, ages 18-29; one male group, ages 30-45; one female group, ages 30-45. What should the 4th group be comprised of?  Females age 18-29?   (A2): Yes, the fourth focus group should be comprised of females ages 18-29.   (Q3):  I recently saw that the State Department will not be allowing travel to Saudi Arabia.  How does that affect this proposed project? Would we still be able to do the project through subcontractors? (A3):   The location of the focus groups in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia has been changed to Kuwait City, Kuwait.  Therefore, travel to Saudi Arabia is not required for this project.  (Q4):  In addition to the deliverables specified in the RFQ, we would like to know whether a presentation or workshop to present the findings will be required.  If so, where would it be held?  (A4):   An in-person presentation is not required.  (Q5): Please clarify whether BBG/IBB wants a total of 16 or 12 focus groups for the television studies. The RFQ is somewhat confusing because on the one hand it states that for the television studies, a total of 16 focus groups shall be conducted in four cities (Cairo, Amman, Casablanca and Riyadh), which would mean 4 groups per city. On the other hand, the RFQ provides recruitment specifications for only 3 groups in each city.  (A5):  The BBG/IBB is requesting a total of 16 focus groups.  The fourth focus group comprised of females ages 18-29 was omitted in error.

PROJECT INFORMATION:   The Lower Fox River and Green Bay Site includes an approximately 39-m ile stretch of the Lower Fox River as well as the bay of Green Bay.  The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have issued  a final Superfund Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study report a s well as supporting documents for the site.  In addition, DNR and EPA also issued a Superfund Record of Decision (ROD), Responsiveness Summary (RS), and numerous (17) white papers for the Sites first two operable units.  The plan in the ROD calls fo r cleaning up PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) contaminated sediments from certain portions of the Lower Fox River.  The ROD was issued in December 2002 and will cover Operable Unit 1 (Little Lake Butte des Morts) and Operable Unit-2 (from the Appleton Dam t o the Little Rapids Dam).  The general project information that follows is not all inclusive of the ROD.   PCB's were discharged into the Fox River by paper mills during the manufacturing and recycling of carbonless copy paper, primarily between 1954 and 1 971. This ROD represents the final decision of the WDNR and EPA on the remedial plan for sed iment cleanup of these two sections of the Lower Fox River. The ROD addresses some of the human health and ecological risks posed to people and ecological receptors associated with PCBs that have been released to the Site.  These reaches comprise app roximately 26 of the 39 miles of the river that flows north from Lake Winnebago to the mouth of the river at Green Bay. This ROD calls for the removal of all contaminated sediment from OU 1 with a concentration of greater than 1 part per million or approxi mately 784,000 cubic yards of material. It is anticipated that the dredged material will be mechanically dewatered and then placed into a landfill for permanent disposal.  Another remedy may utilize vitrification of dredged contaminated sediment as an alte rnative to off-site disposal. DNR and EPA have selected a monitored natural recovery approach for OU 2. This cleanup relies on natural processes to break down, dilute, or bury the PCBs; and on a program designed to monitor the levels of PCBs in the sedimen t fish tissue and in the water. The current estimated average surface PCB concentration in OU-2 is 0.61 ppm.  With the ROD for OU-1 and 2 completed, WDNR and EPA will focus their attention to completing the ROD for the remaining operable units of the Lower  Fox River and Green Bay (OU 3-5). The agencies expect a decision for the remaining three operable units, OU-3 from the Little Rapids Dam to the De Pere Dam, OU-4 from the De Pere Dam to the mouth of the river at Green Bay, and OU-5 the entire bay of Green  Bay, to be made later this year.  Copies of the OU 1 and 2 ROD, RS & White Papers, the Site wide final RI/FS, FOX River Data Base as well as other supporting information is available at the DNRs Lower Fox River web site at the following address: htt p://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/water/wm/lowerfox/index.html.  In addition, to review hard copies of the reports, copies of the ROD and the final RI/FS are available at one of the information repositories set up at libraries in the Fox Valley and Green Bay are a. Appleton Public Library, 225 N. Oneida St., Appleton, WI;  Brown County Library, 515 Pine St., Green Bay, WI;  Door County Library, 104 S. Fourth Ave., Sturgeon Bay, WI; Oneida Community Library, 201 Elm St., Oneida, WI and the Oshkosh Public Library, 1 06 Washington Ave., Oshkosh, WI.  In addition to the repositories, copies of the Lower Fox River and Green Bay Site Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS), Risk Assessment (RA), the Model Documentation Report (MDR), and ROD may be available a t DNR offices in Madison (101 South Webster Street), Green Bay (801 East Walnut Street) and at EPA offices in Chicago (77 West Jackson Boulevard).  A Corps of Engineers Section 905(b) (WRDA 86) Reconnaissance Study has concluded that there is Federal inter est in the removal or remediation of contaminated sediments in the Lower Fox River and bay of Green Bay for ecosystem restoration under the authority of Section 312 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1990 (WRDA 90), as amended.  A copy of the Reconn aissance Study will be available at the Detroit District Corps of Engineers web site http://www.lre.usace.army.mil for the Lower Fox River and Bay of Green Bay, Wisconsin site, or by contacting the Detroit District at 313-226-6760.  Additional ecosystem re storation project planning and studies are required to develop plan formulation criteria and tools (e.g., models) and metrics for measuring the outputs (e.g.: habitat units, indices) of alternative plans appropriate for the ecosystem under consideration. Design services may also be required to implement selected remediation alternatives within the project limits, including Operable Units 3, 4 and 5.    Planning activities may include preparation of a feasibility study or portions thereof and an environment al impact statement or environmental assessment which shall be conducted in accordance with the Planning Guidance Notebook ER 1105-2-100 and other applicable U. S. Army Corps of Engineers regulations, guidelines and procedures.  Public outreach efforts may also be required for this study. The local sponsor may conduct some tasks in the feasibility study and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other agencies may co nduct some of the tasks.   3.

                  capability of offeror, for example) is neither requested nor desired by your office.

Answer:    No additional information is required.  Price and only price related factors. 

Question 23:  Can you provide an average for the airtime used on your existing Mini-M units:

Answer:   Average monthly Coast Guard usage for Mini-M is around 7000 minutes/month.

Question 24:  Is there a monthly usage that we should project to?  In other words, do we assume 100
                  minutes per month per Mini-M ( as an example)?  Also, is the total population of Mini-Ms
                  assumed to be 80, 100 or 180?
                

Answer:   Assume monthly usage of current Mini-Ms to be around 7000 minutes.
                 Currently there are about 80 terminals, with that number doubling by the end of 2003.

Question 25:  How many Mini-M air-time minutes/month were used by the current Mini-M terminals.
                  How many terminals produced those air-time minutes.

Answer:     80 active terminals, about 30-40 terminals account for around 7000 minutes/month.

Question 26:  What is the current air-time price/minutes that the Coast Guard is paying?  

Answer:   This information can not be provided.  The current award was not awarded as full and open
                 but under GSA Schedule contract.

Question 27:  Is there a particular format that the bid has to be in or can I just send a letter with my
                       prices?

Answer:   A letter with your prices would be fine.  Also include a statement whether or not you can
                 provide billing information to reflect each terminals monthly usage/call duration/call
                 destination/cost per call.

Question 28:  We would like an extension of the bid deadline until April 15th.  Is that possible?

Answer:   No extension will be granted.

Question 29:  Will the USCG consider the Iridium system as a viable option for this?

Answer:   No, Iridium cannot be used due to previously engineered solutions (interoperability).

Question 30:  Can you provide an average for the airtime used on your existing Mini-M units?

Answer:   Average monthly Coast Guard usage for Mini-M is around 7000 minutes/month.

Question 31:  Could you tell us as to the total monthly usage (in minutes) by STU versus other
                  INMARSAT usage for the U.S. Coast Guard, 80 vessel fleet.

Answer:  We do not have any data to provide you with an answer of how many minutes/month
               are via STU-III for our Thrane and Thrane 3064s.  STU-III is highly utilized, monthly
               usage is about 7000 minutes Coast Guard wide.

<DESC>DESC: THIS AMENDMENT IS ISSUED TO EXTEND THE RESPONSE DUE DATE OF RFI INFORMATION FROM 16 MAY 2003 TO 30 MAY 2003.
The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO-SCOTT) hereby issues the following Request For Information (RFI) regarding global video teleconferencing services.  
A.  PURPOSE: The Defense Information System Network (DISN) Video Service (DVS) Program Management Office seeks information for the provision of a global digital video rich-media conferencing service incorporating advanced technologies for the Department of Defense (DoD). The information gathered from this RFI will assist in the development of strategic alternatives for (a) future Request for Proposal(s).   
B.  INTENT: The RFI is intended to gather information about the availability of technology/products in the market that will fulfill anticipated requirements for video, audio, and web-based conferencing services and includes other value-added elements. Information submitted in response to this RFI will become the property of DISA. DISA will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. DISA will not pay for information provided, and is not liable for any costs incurred by the company in response to this RFI. Price quotes are not required, however, general cost estimates are appreciated to assist in planning. Cost estimates provided will not be binding for the company. 
C.	BACKGROUND: Video Teleconferencing (VTC) is considered a critical element of DoD Command and Control (C2). The use of video conferencing in day-to-day operations of the DoD includes Combatant Commands (COCOMs) execution of war plans and exercise plans, military training, simulation, and general unit command and operation. Regular system users include the National Command Authority and Military Service leaders. DISA is assigned responsibility for providing global video teleconferencing (VTC) capabilities for the Department of Defense (DoD) for command and control (C2). These services are separate from services for non-C2 functions. However, non-C2 VTC is integral to the DoD video service requirements and complementary to C2 VTC. The current video services contract includes video hub services to provide video, audio and data bridging, network bridging, speed matching, inter-hub bandwidth management, conference scheduling, conference set-up and control, security services including access controls, encryption and secure conferences, limited problem isolation, and other related services. The current contract does not include end-user equipment maintenance and support or customer conference room operations. Transmission and network bandwidth management is provided by other related contracts. A concept for an end-to-end conferencing service with multiple service level options is being considered. In such a system, DoD customers could choose a level of service needed to support their operational environment. Services may range from a multipoint conferencing hub service to a complete end-to-end service including customer site operations, customer site maintenance, and customer premise equipment. However, DISN networks and their follow-on architecture will be the fundamental transport infrastructure for DOD end-users.  Conferencing systems may include studio, fixed, desktop, mobile and deployable systems and related installation or maintenance services. Over the life of the service, periodic technology insertions would be expected to maintain standards-based services and to incorporate emerging video conferencing and related technologies.  
D. 	DESIRED INFORMATION: DISA desires information on industry capabilities to support the services and features listed below. This list is neither detailed nor all-inclusive, but is representative of the type of services DISA expects the defense video conferencing service to provide. DISA will consider responses to this request for information in defining system requirements and alternatives. DISA is aware that some customization may be required to meet specific C2 requirements.  FEATURES: Support for integrated video, audio, and web conferencing. Compliance with the latest Federal Telecommunications Recommendation for video teleconferencing including consideration for support of H.320,  H.323,  H.310, SIP and other related video standards. Compliance with industry standards for data conferencing including T.120 and related standards. Compliance with Defense Collaboration Tool Suite standards.  Support for conferencing among users on multiple network accesses including T1, ISDN, IP and ATM networks. Networks will include Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), Defense Switched Network (DSN), FTS2001, commercial ISDN, and may include Nonsecure IP Router Network (NIPRNET), Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNet), and DISN ATM (DATMS) .  Support for point-to-point and multi-point conferencing among diverse end points including support for interactive, teleseminar, and telebroadcast services, with full duplex audio and video using a variety of compression standards. Provide for secure and non-secure audio add-on to videoconferences.  Provide for one-way streaming of videoconferences.  Provide caching of video information for remote retrieval.  Support for all forms of video conferencing applications: teleconference, teletraining, telemedicine, tele-maintenance and similar applications. Provides a variety of conferencing equipment suites including configurations for studio, room, desktop, mobile, satellite and deployable environments and remote management of these. Provides installation and maintenance options for customer location equipment. Interface with Allied host nation networks and standards. Video and audio format and compression conversions and transcoding, continuous presence. Variable data rates and speed matching.  Features to enhance reliability and survivability to support C2. Support for classified conferences at different security levels including Unclassified, Sensitive But Unclassified, and Classified (up to and including Top Secret Collateral). Incorporate an automated interactive scheduling and reservation system with worldwide accessibility. Support for both on-demand and scheduled conferences. Integrated network management including fault isolation management.  Detailed requirements will be promulgated in (a) future RFP(s). DISA solicits information from industry about capabilities and services that can be supported as well as information about potentially qualified providers of these system capabilities. This information will assist DISA in alternatives definition and system planning and budgeting.  
E. SUBMISSION OF COMMENTS:  ALL COMMENTS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA THE DITCO-SCOTT WEB SITE.  SUBMISSIONS SHALL NOT BE MAILED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  Prior to submitting comments, companies shall register with DITCO via its Contracting Opportunities web site at https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from potential offerors, extend the response date, and correct errors in the original combined synopsis/solicitation. Question 1:  We're curious why the specific OEM has been requested and what information does NRL have on this scope.  This microscope is no longer made by the OEM, so the RFQ has requested an obsolete model, which has no IR capability?  The bid does request IR backside alignment and as the specification is written, the Zeiss microscope should be disqualified as an optical microscope.  Answer 1: As stated in 4.1 of the Specifications, the aligner must be equipped with a Zeiss Split Field Microscope or a microscope of comparable range of magnification and positional range (stated in Section 4.2) is acceptable.  If a new microscope is not available a refurbished one with the same warranty as a new unit is acceptable and the microscope must have an objective separation range of at least 20-120 mm.  Question 2: Section 1.3, is IR backside imaging required in the bid or does the tool have to be field upgradeable?  Can the tool have bottom side optical imaging instead of IR?  Answer 2:  IR backside imaging is required and optical imaging is acceptable instead of IR. Question 3: Section 2.1, states samples 0.5"-8", but section 3.3 states the beam size can be 6" Is 8" a requirement?  Answer 3:  The capability of doing 9" wafers is required.  The 6" beam diameter means that we won't be able to expose the whole 8" wafer and this is acceptable. Question 4: Section 2.2 Can the tool use bottom loading standard Mask holders for vacuum contact?  Answer 4: Yes it can. Question 5: Section 2.3 Why is 10 degrees of rotation and only 0.15" of x/y travel for alignment? Answer 5: The 0.15 inch (") travel is an error.  It should read  .75" of x/y travel. Question 6: Section 4.1, why does the microscope have to be a Zeiss?  Answer 6: See answer to Question 1 above.  Question 7:  Section 4.1, Can a video microscope be used in place of the optical microscope?  Answer 7:  A video microscope can be used if it meets the specifications.  
Question 8:  Section 4.1, do all objectives have to meet the 20mm minimum separation?  Answer 8: Yes, all objectives have to meet the separation requirement.  Question 9: Section 4.1, Are turrets required?  Answer 9: Turrets are not required as long as changing magnification doesn't require screwing and unscrewing objectives or some equally inconvenient action. Question 10: Section 5.3, Can the system have an integrated isolation table?  Answer 10: Yes, it can. Question 11: Section 6.2, why are top-loading maskholders required for vacuum contact if standard bottom loading maskholders can be used for all printing modes.  Answer 11:  Since this tool will be used for a wide variety of applications, the versatility is required.  The latest DFARS change applicable to this requirement is corrected to read 20030430.  FAR clauses 52.203-8 and 52.203-10 are not applicable and are deleted from this requirement. The Original Response date stated under "General Information" is revised to read: May 27, 2003.

<DESC>This is to modify the previous synopsis which appeared originally appeared on April 17, 2003. This modifies the procurement concerning security clearances, selection criteria, and changes the response due date from May 22, 2003 to May 30, 2003. This procurement is open for responses from all firms.  The work includes an indefinite quantity contract for environmental engineering and design services at various locations in the Engineering Field Activity (EFA) Chesapeake region, which includes Washington DC, MD, and VA.

It is anticipated that about 10 percent of the delivery task orders associated with this A-E IDQ may require team members to have active Secret level clearances. The A-E must propose a separate team with members possessing a Secret clearance if the primary team does not. The selected A/E firm shall prepare an OMSI package by assembling Information Systems and Operation & Maintenance Systems Information, which will accompany all primary system components.  Delivery orders/projects may include, but will not be limited to, all or part of the following: preparation of studies and technical reports; conducting engineering investigations and remediation; environmental sampling; training; project engineering documentation (PED); preparation of preliminary and final designs; and preparation of plans, specifications, and construction cost estimates ready for bidding.  Such services as studies and review of shop drawings may be required at any time up to the final acceptance of all work.  Hazardous materials/hazardous wastes, i.e. asbestos, lead paint, PCB, heavy metals may exist at the project sites.  If hazardous substances are encountered, the A-E Contractor will be required to conduct removal surveys, including testing and sampling, provide design removal procedures and prepare construction contract documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous substances.  All licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project sites are required by the A-E firm and their subcontractors.  The general intention is to provide design and engineering services as necessary to support the execution of this contract. The selected firm for this contract will be required to provide overhead, profit, and discipline hourly rates to the Contracting Officer within 10 days after receiving the Request for Proposal.  The selected firm will be required to participate in orientation and site visit meetings (when requested) for each delivery order within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days after receiving the Request for Proposal.  Each project will be firm fixed price A-E contract.  The total contract amount will not exceed $5,000,000 over 5 years.  Design and engineering services for this contract will be subject to the availability of funds.  The estimated start date is July 2003.  Selection evaluation criteria, in relative order of importance are: 1. (a) Specialized experience and professional qualifications of the engineering firm (with its subcontractors), and the proposed project team (the team/office actually accomplishing the work) in providing complete engineering and design services for the contract requirements as described above related to water, wastewater and stormwater; (b) the firms computer, CAD and GIS capabilities; 2.(a) Specialized experience and professional qualifications of the engineering firm (with its subcontractors), and the proposed project team in providing complete engineering and design services for all environmental media, i.e., air, asbestos, EPCRA, EMS, Hazardous Waste, Infectious Waste, Lead Based Paint, noise, oil pollution, PCBs, pesticides, radon, solid waste, recycling, SPCC, ODS plans, above ground and below ground storage tanks, EBS, and pollution prevention; (b) Ability to perform work requiring Secret security clearance when indicated as necessary; 3. Preference will be given to those firms with prior experience in Navy/Marine Corps environmental programs, and secondarily for experience with other governmental agencies; 4. Past performance of the prime A-E firm (and subcontractors) in the firm's quality control/quality assurance programs, both internal and field related, to assure quality fieldwork, coordinated technically accurate study results, recommendations, specifications, plans, and construction cost estimates.  Each firm's past performance(s) and performance ratings (5 years) will be reviewed during the evaluation process and can affect the selection outcome; 5. Preference will be given to firms within a 150-mile radius of the Washington Navy Yard, provided that application of the criterion leaves an appropriate number of highly qualified firms.  The Project Manager and other key personnel associated with this IDQ shall be located within the 150-mile radius.   Firms which meet the requirements listed in this announcement are invited to submit one copy each of the completed Standard Forms (SF) 254 and 255, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, to the office indicated below.  Site visits will not be arranged during the advertisement period.  This proposed contract is being solicited on an unrestricted basis.  Firms having a current SF 254 on file with this office may also be considered.  Interested firms are requested to include facsimile numbers, the Contractor Establishment Code (CEC) - formerly the DUNS number, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) on the SF 255 and SF 254 in Block 3.  Interested firms are also requested to include their A-E Contractor Appraisal Support System ( ACASS) number on the SF 255 in Block 3.  In Block 10, state why your firm is specially qualified based on the selection evaluation criteria.  Also, use Block 10 to provide additional information desired by your firm.

Hand delivery or overnight delivery is highly recommended.  Fax and electronic copies of the SF 254 and 255 will not be accepted.  This is not a request for proposal.  The selected firm may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  EEO compliance is required.  Because this contract acquisition could result in an award over $500,000.00, a subcontracting plan will be required by the selected firm if the firm is a large business concern.  The small disadvantaged business set-aside goals in that subcontracting plan shall not be less than 5 percent of the subcontracted work.  This set-aside goal of not less than 5 percent also applies to women-owned small business concerns.  This does not apply if the prime firm is a small business concern.  Effective 1 October 1997, A/E contractors are now required to register their firms in the Central Contractor database prior to receiving a contract award.  This database provides basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government and complies with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which requires Federal agencies to have the Taxpayer Identification Number of every contractor and pay contractors through electronic funds transfer.  A/E contractors will only have to provide this information once with annual updates or as key company information changes occur.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.acq.mil/ec, through any DOD Certified Value Added Network; or a paper may be obtained by calling the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting a Sources Sought/Market Survey FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to determine if SMALL BUSINESSES possess the necessary technical capabilities to support the Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) IT Infrastructure Consolidation project. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND/OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.   RESPONSES ARE LIMITED TO 25 PAGES AND STANDARD COMPANY BROCHURES IS NOT DESIRED. INFORMATION SUBMITTED SHALL FOCUS ON THE CAPABILITY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES DEFINED BELOW.  RESPONSES WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED AND/OR REVIEWED FROM FIRMS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS A SMALL BUSINESS FOR THE NAICS CODE LISTED BELOW.
FDA is a regulatory agency with broad responsibilities for protecting the health of American consumers.  The following illustrates the tremendous scope of activity that the Agency oversees: (a) Last year consumers spent $1 trillion--more than 20 percent of their money--on products the Agency regulates; (b)FDA judges the safety of an expanding scientific revolution. Public and private entities invest an estimated $50 billion annually in biomedical research and technology;(c) FDA assures the safety of the Nation's manufacturing and processing: FDA is a 10,000-person agency deployed in over 200 locations nationwide including Puerto Rico, and is responsible for monitoring over 100,000 U.S. firms that manufacture or process products; (d) FDA also monitors the safety of almost 8 million import shipments that enter this country each year. 
Supporting the Agency in its important role is a significant reliance on information such as regulatory, scientific and administrative data critical to the performance of its key business processes as well as data that tracks the flow of documents and associated processes to ensure products are reviewed and approved in a timely manner.  Underlying this is an infrastructure framework of equipment, software and services that further facilitates the flow of information.  Currently, it is a diverse environment with authority and responsibility existing with the Centers and major Offices, totaling 8 IT organizations, with some Agency-wide efforts, such as the wide area network, resting with the Office of the CIO.  While some standards exist  for example, Oracle as the database standard and Microsoft as the desktop software standard  there is still much diversification; for example server operating systems consist of an array of Vax, NT and Unix versions. 
In FY2004, the FDA will effect consolidation of its IT infrastructure into a single shared services organization. To facilitate the effort, it will also consolidate IT infrastructure support under one service provider.  The FDA will award a performance based contract with a one year base period and four one year option periods.  It is anticipated that the resulting contract will include a Fixed Price portion and an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (fixed rates or time and material) portion.  The offeror must show recent experience in executing in a performance based contract with a large agency having a distributed installed base.

The service provider will be responsible for tier one through tier three support in the following major IT services: wide and local area networks, helpdesk and call center, e-mail, file and print services, database management, server management and IT security.  The service provider will also ensure the services are managed, distributed, and accounted for using uniform processes and data that meet the agencys needs and standards.  Tiered support is defined as: Tier 0  Self Help through Web technologies;
Tier 1  Call Center Support; Tier 2  Deskside/ Onsite Support; Tier 3  Specialized/Subject Matter Expert Support.
In addition, the Agency will require the service provider to demonstrate that, at a minimum, it is at level 2 of the Capability Maturity Model, with clear intent to improve to subsequent levels.  The service provider will be responsible for creating and maintaining documentation relating to day-to-day operations and service response times.
The applicable NAICS Code is 541512 with a size standard of $21 million in annual receipts for potential small businesses. Vendors with the capability of providing services defined above are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information which demonstrates their ability to fulfill the requirement including but not limited to, technical capability, CMM Level 2 or better, past performance/experience (including brief description of the project, type of contract, references and size of project), established teaming arrangements/agreements with other companies, and experience with performance based contracts for the type of services described and size. The capabilities/expertise documents will be used to determine if SMALL BUSINESSES possess the expertise to successfully perform the requirement and if any resulting requirement should be SET ASIDE for SMALL BUSINESSES.  Therefore, any SMALL BUSINESS with experience/capabilities is STRONGLY encouraged to submit the requested information.  Responses, within the page limitation (25 pages), should include enough detail to demonstrate capabilities/expertise in all aspects of this announcement. Please submit five (5) copies of your response.  Responses, including the vendors business status (e.g.: small, small disadvantaged, minority-owned, 8(a), HUBZone, etc.) should be mailed (no faxed submissions will be accepted) to the following address (HAND DELIVERED/OVERNIGHT/REGULAR MAIL):  DHHS/FDA Attention: Mekeba Barrett 5630 Fishers Lane (HFA-520), Room 2116 Rockville, MD 20857.

The Co= ntractor shall design, develop, and deliver to the FAA, websites that incor= porate state-of-the-art website marketing strategies and design technology.=   Requirements are defined further in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The cur= rent version of the SOW is provided as a separate document under this Scree= ning Information Request (SIR).  If required, the FAA may revise the SOW in=  subsequent SIR releases. This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, = involves the announcement/SIR 1 of the requirement.  The second phase (SIR = 2) will evaluate information gathered in SIR 1 as well as other factors ide= ntified in SIR 2.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this annou= ncement/SIR will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remainin= g phase(s) of the down select process will be identified in future communic= ations with those firms that successfully respond to this SIR. =20 The procurement action resulting from this SIR 1 is contemplated as a set-a= side for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Bu= sinesses (SEDBs) that are expressly certified by the Small Business Adminis= tration (SBA) for participation in the SBA=E2=80=99s 8(a) program at the ti= me of release of this announcement/SIR.  Only those 8(a) vendors that are c= ertified under the SBA in Oklahoma and Texas will be allowed to participate=  in this SIR.

In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 pe= rcent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be e= xpended for employees of the prime Contractor.  This requirement is found i= n AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitations on Subcontracting. Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of resp= onsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilitie= s to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific infor= mation provided must be accurate and complete, because it will be used to d= etermine each vendor=E2=80=99s eligibility to participate.  Documentation m= ust be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vend= or=E2=80=99s eligibility pursuant to this SIR.  The FAA reserves the right = to contact references and verify each vendor=E2=80=99s information.  Any st= atement included in a vendor=E2=80=99s response that is verified by the FAA=  as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection. The Contractor provided documentation shall include, but is not limited to,=  that prepared to show compliance with the Special Standards of Responsibil= ity, such as information on Contractor developed Internet Marketing Strateg= y Reports, Contractor developed Section 508 compliant websites, and estimat= ed cost for the requirement.

Each submission for the two Speci= al Standards of Responsibility in the following sections 1.0 through 2.0 wi= ll be evaluated on an =E2=80=9Cacceptable/unacceptable=E2=80=9D basis.  Whe= re a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standa= rd of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable= . Sound judgment will be applied in determining appropriate variations and ad= aptations necessary for individual situations, provided that these do not c= onstitute a departure from the basic concepts and intent of this SIR evalua= tion. 1.0  Past Performance and Experience: =20 1.1  Past Performance and Experience Standards - Vendors combined with any = subcontractor(s) must demonstrate an acceptable level of responsibility in = the areas of past performance and experience.  Past performance means =E2= =80=9Chow well=E2=80=9D a vendor or subcontractor has performed.

All pages shall be stapled toget= her.  It shall be physically separate from section 2.0 submittals (i.e. not=  stapled together with them). 1.3  FAA Evaluation of Past Performance and Experience - The FAA will evalu= ate each vendor=E2=80=99s submittal to determine its acceptability in the s= pecial standard of responsibility for the areas of past performance and exp= erience as described in paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 above.  The level of effort = and detail of the evaluation will be at the FAA=E2=80=99s discretion. Where inquiries made pursuant to the vendor provided customer references re= veal the vendor=E2=80=99s performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated = for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administr= ative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level;=  poor past performance based on customer satisfaction, etc.), the vendor wi= ll no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process.

<DESC>The US Army TACOM-ARDEC at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with General Atomics for the Design, Fabricate, Integrate  and Demonstation support of a M-ACE Turret . It is currently the intention of  TACOM-ARDEC to issue a sole-source contract pursuant to FAR  6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). This is a follow-on contract for continued support of unique  services from the original developer, and award to any other source would  likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not  expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in  fulfilling the Armys requirements. This effort establishes and defines the non- specification requirements for Contractor efforts under a engineering services  contract associated with design, fabrication support, and integration and  demonstration support of a M-ACE Turret.  The M-ACE Turret will be required to   withstand the imposed firing loads, as defined by the government, while  minimizing weight. The turret/weapon system interface requirements will also be  defined by the government. Submittal of information is requested via electronic  mail only to Donna Apgar dapgar@pica.army.mil. A contract will be issued for  one year. This notice of intent is not a request for competition; no  solicitation is available, however, interested parties may express, in writing,  their interest and document their bona fide capability to fulfill the  requirement. Such information will be reviewed only to determine if it is  necessary to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination not to compete  this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. This is not  a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 25.

GOVERNMENT DEBT ISSUANCE AND MANAGEMENT ADVISORS 
EMERGING MARKETS  WORLDWIDE 

The U.S. Treasury Department provides technical assistance and policy advice to senior government and central bank officials and market participants in nearly 30 countries. We are recruiting candidates for positions as resident (long-term) and intermittent (short term) advisors in government debt issuance and management in countries throughout the world, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Southeast and Central Asia, Latin America, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. This recruitment is for global assignments and significant international travel is required.

For resident (long-term) assignments, we seek experts in domestic government securities issuance and management. Experience in international bond markets is highly desirable. Applicants for resident assignments ideally should have a combination of public and private sector experience in government debt management, investment banking or financial advisory work. For intermittent (short term) assignments, we are seeking advisors with particular expertise in: liability management policy and procedures; legal framework for government securities; market regulation; custody, clearing and settlement; fixed income trading; treasury operations; and mortgage and other asset-backed finance. For all positions, management experience is desired. Prior overseas work experience in challenging environments is a distinct advantage. Foreign language skills are highly desirable. While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of host government officials and provide sound but realistic advice to a sovereign government in an emerging market environment will determine ultimate success.   Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.

SALARY AND BENEFITS: Salaries are negotiated in accordance with program regulations, based on demonstrated salary history and the skills required. The salary range is from $85,000 to $134,000.

<DESC>This combined synopsis and RFQ advertises the Government's bona fide need for SEVEN (7) high data rate, fully programmable space data demodulators and test modulators for its command and data acquisition (CDA) stations in Fairbanks, AK and Wallops, VA. In subsequent text reference is made to "seven demodulators".  Priced options are also requested for up to three (3) additional units, although the Government's minimum requirement is for 7 demodulators and two (2) test modulators.  Offerors are instructed that if the test modulator is integrated in the demodulator chassis, each item may contain a test modulator; however, if a separate chassis is proposed for the test modulator, only 2 deliverable test modulator units, in addition to the seven demodulators, are required. FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES THE OFFERORS' ATTENTION IS DIRECTED TO THE RFI DATED March 21, 2003, AND ENTITLED: "59--Market Survey-High Data Rate-Fully Programmable Receiver/ Demodulator w/ Selectable Modulation".  However, this RFQ shall represent the final specification in all instances wherein a conflict appears.  All 7 demodulators and 2 test modulators must be delivered F.O.B. Destination to Harris Technical Services Corp. (Harris), Attn: Mr. Frank Bramhall, 301 N. Washington St., Bellevue, NE 68005-2599.  Four (4) units will ultimately be located at the NOAA/Fairbanks Command and Data Acquisition Station (FCDAS) 1300 Eisele Road, Fairbanks, AK 99712-1725; and three (3) at the Wallops Command and Data Acquisition Station (WCDAS) 35663 Chincoteague Rd Wallops, VA 23337-0039.  As part of the selection process defined by this RFQ, a test and evaluation "qualification unit(s)" (consisting of 1 demodulator and 1 test modulator) is required to be furnished to the Harris location for its evaluation by the Government by July 7, 2003, at the Offeror's own expense and at no risk to the Government; this unit will subsequently be sent to Fairbanks for testing and evaluation in the operational environment. The Government will be responsible for delivering these items to FCDAS and returning them in the same condition to each respective vendor following a 30-45 day test and evaluation period.  The Offerors may attend either or both of these tests on a non-interference basis, if they desire, and at their own expense, by furnishing the name(s) of the attendees. The rules of engagement in the test plan shall govern interactions with the offerors during the testing sequence. Following the Government's selection of the winning offeror, all seven units from the selected contractor must be delivered by the following time period: from September 30, 2003 (early delivery) to December 31, 2003 (late delivery). This advertisement is a Request for Quote, under RFQ Number IPO-RFQ-3-HDR-0001 to acquire high data rate, fully programmable space data demodulators and test modulators, which are commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101. This Request for Quote (RFQ) combines the synopsis and specification, and requests a firm fixed price proposal by May 30, 2003. The required system specifications set forth below correspond to the Government's need to accommodate multiple missions without the need for equipment customization, delays due to equipment integration, preliminary in-plant programming, or other modifications. Therefore, this commercial item specification must be for the acquisition of a fully programmable demodulator and test modulator that covers multiple data rates including rates from 1 Mbps to 400 Mbps for QPSK and from 1 Mbps to 200 Mbps for BPSK, as well as multiple modulation types. We immediately foresee supporting the list of missions below, but the multi-mission receiver shall not necessarily be limited to this list of selected missions:  WindSat Coriolis, METOP, AQUA, TERRA, AURA (Jan. 2004), , NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP), EO-1, ICESat, Radarsat, Landsat-7, ALOS, GIFTS, and JERS-1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), is conducting a commercial item acquisition to procure a high data rate, fully programmable (also referred to as "selectable"), space data ground terminal application.  The items being procured are a demodulator and a test modulator.  Other requirements include a training option, licensing, warranty, and an extended warranty option. The specific characteristics follow. All specifications are mandatory unless otherwise noted. The demodulator must be capable of accepting and processing data rates from 1 Mbps to 400Mbps for QPSK and from 1 Mbps to 200 Mbps for BPSK. The desired input rate must be software selectable.   The input frequency must be720 MHz +/-400 kHz.  The input impedance must be 50 ohms with a VSWR of 2:1 maximum.  The phase noise must equal or be less than: 70 dBc @ 10 kHz, -100 dBc @ 100 kHz, and -120 dBc @ 1 MHz.  The selectable modulation types must be: BSPK, QPSK, SQPSK (OQPSK), and UQPSK; the following modulation types are desirable: AQPSK and 8PSK.  The UQPSK demodulator (used for direct broadcast for TERRA) must accept and process a differential data rate on I and Q of up to 4:1 minimum in either order.  All digital outputs must be differential Emitter Coupled Logic (ECL).  The demodulator must output NRZ-L data and clock for the I and Q channels and a merged I and Q.  The demodulator must demodulate and bit-synchronize NRZ-L/S/M and SP-L (Bi-phase) PCM, and convert the differential decoding of NRZ-S/M to NRZ-L for output.    The demodulator must also perform CCSDS compatible down-link derandomization using the following Polynomial: h(x) = x8 + x7 + x5 + x3 + 1. The BER must not be worse than the theoretical probability of error more than the following: <150 Mbps: =<1 dB, 150 Mbps to400 Mbps: =<2 dB for an Eb/No of 2.0 to 12.5 dB.  The bit synchronizer data rate variation must be:  within 0.1% for data rates up to 150 Mbps and within 0.01% for data rates above 150 Mbps.  The demodulator must provide quality of service statistics (packets delivered, BER, etc.) on the output data to the control PC workstation upon request.  Eb/No should be shown to within 0.1 dB in 0.1 dB steps.  Input signal strength should be shown to within 2 dBm in steps of 1 dB.  The demodulator must provide software selectable CCSDS compatible Viterbi decoding for forward error correction with a constraint length of K=7, rate = 1/3, 1/2, 3/4.  The Viterbi decoder must be capable of being bypassed when receiving non-Viterbi encoded data.  The Viterbi decoding must be 3-bit soft-decision and must provide 5.2 dB of gain with an input Eb/No of 6.4 dB or greater.  The demodulator must provide I.F. band-limiting filters that are applicable to the data rate being received, including root-raised cosine and Sin(x)/X compensation.  The root-raised cosine filter must have a selectable alpha of 0.3 to 0.8 in steps of 0.05.  The filter types and combinations must be software selectable.  It is desired that the demodulator and test modulator have an MTBF of 20,000 hours or greater.    The unit must support remote command, control, and status via a TCP/IP interface, and an API must be provided.  Warranty of one-year parts and labor is strongly DESIRED.  The Government requests separately priced extended warranty periods covering software and hardware (priced in annual increments (1 or more years, up to 5 years), with pre-priced remote technical support.  The test modulator must be compatible with the demodulator specified above.    It must support end-to-end testing with a modulated RF signal at 720 MHz +/-3 ppm that can be injected into the demodulator and other devices as desired.  The modulation types, encoding, and data rates must be the same as those specified for the demodulator above.  The modulation type, encoding, and data rates must be software selectable.  The data set used for the modulation must be a known data set that can be used to determine the performance of the demodulator and other data processing devices.  The modulation must be capable of being turned off through software control so that the test modulator will output a continuous wave (CW).  The RF output of the test modulator must be capable of being switched off through software control.    The test modulator must provide software controlled simulated Doppler shift identical to that of a low earth orbiting satellite.  The Government intends to use its Contractor, Harris Technical Services Corp., Bellevue, NE, The Raytheon Corp., User Technology Associates, and The Aerospace Corporation, El Segundo, CA, as its support contractors to assist it in evaluating the merits of each system level feature. We anticipate setting up a test and demonstration period lasting approximately 30 days to first bench test all compliant units at Harris, Bellevue, NE, and then field test the units at NOAA's satellite command and data acquisition station in Fairbanks, AK. The tests will be rigorously and uniformly applied to each capable unit, and the results will be used as the primary weight of determination of mission technical suitability. The evaluation determination will rely on the written material in your response to this RFQ, and the performance of your unit(s) in the tests. Government personnel will exclusively make the determination of selection for award, based on the written material and test results, and the unit prices and sustainability of the systems. Technical suitability will be integrated with the offered price of all units and options to determine the BEST VALUE source selection. The following weights will apply to the evaluation:  Factor A. System-Level Compliance: The Offeror demonstrates on paper, and by direct test on the bench and in the operational environment in the delivery location(s) in the field, that the proposed commercial item conforms in all respects to the mandatory system specifications set forth in the requirement: Maximum Points, 50; if non-conformance to some specified requirements exists, but system trade space exists and excess compliance in one or more other requirements offsets the first non-complying requirement, the maximum points that can be earned are 30. Factor B. Past Performance: It can be shown that the commercial item or its closest architectural counterpart has performed reliably in an operational setting, supporting similar spacecraft missions with high quality products, without experiencing long periods of outage due to component or operational failures.  Reliability will be based on MTBF hours approaching 20,000 hrs.; ease of operational usage by trained personnel; level of dependence on LRU spares, or a complete, spare chassis; MTTR in hours; and the quality of the training package available for O&M support personnel. The maximum points that can be earned in this Factor are 20. Factor C.  System Set-up: The Offeror must demonstrate to the Government the ease and flexibility of the demodulator's embedded configuration menus and options to accommodate new satellite missions. The first unit that will be provided for demonstration and test must include an operations manual that will direct a first-time user through a set-up routine designed to add one or more satellite missions. The maximum points that can be earned in this Factor are 20.  Factor D. Sustainability: The offer will be evaluated for its proposal content for value-added training, remote technical support, quick response time on repairs, and the extent of the warranty protection. The maximum points that can be earned are 10. The preceding four Factors are termed Mission Suitability.  Mission Suitability is substantially more important in computing the final integrated score than price. If technical scores are rated in close proximity, the Government will rely to a greater extent on price to make its source selection decision. All deliverable items must be delivered by no later than December 31, 2003. A standard commercial warranty is requested as part of the price, and must be incorporated in the contract terms, if the offer is selected. An optional priced, extended warranty term is highly desirable.  The Offeror must price each UNIT PRICE as a firm-fixed-price (FFP), to include all direct and indirect costs, administrative costs and profit or fee, including but not necessarily limited to, all direct labor, manufacturing costs, materials, quality assurance and packaging, licensing, on-site testing support if elected by the Offeror, and other direct costs such as shipping, postage and handling costs for delivery of the units to the Harris Corp., Bellevue, NE, F.O.B. destination, training costs, the cost of performing any modifications to comply with the specifications, if applicable, and technical support costs, whether remote or on-site, as required. Offers must quote prices as follows:  CLIN 1001 through 1007, seven (7) each Selectable High Data Rate Demodulator, Unit Priced in U.S. Dollars (if Test Modulators are proposed as separate chassis, add CLINS 1001a and 1005a); CLIN 1008, Option 1 Demodulator; CLIN 1009, Option 2 Demodulators; CLIN 1010, Option 3 Demodulators; CLIN 1011, extended warranty and time period; CLIN 1012, on-site test and training (up to 10 staff); CLIN 1013, technical support (remote or on-site-specify limit on hours).
