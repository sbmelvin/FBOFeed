<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command , Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, has a requirement in support of PM-Force Sustainment Systems for the Advanced Low Velocity Airdrop System Light and Heavy (ALVADS-L/H).  The intent of the ALVADS-L/H program is to identify a new parachute which will replace the G-11 cargo parachute and will ensure load survivability at lower altitudes while being more cost effective than the G-11 over its lifecycle.  The Advanced Low Velocity Airdrop System's (ALVADS) is a suite of options when distribution of supplies and equipment is required by aerial delivery.  ALVADS consists of five components:  Component I - ALVADS Extraction Parachute Jettison System (EPJS), Component II - ALVADS Light, Component III - ALVADS Heavy, Component IV - ALVADS Advanced Cargo Parachute Release System (ACPRS), and Component V - ALVADS Rapid Rigging and De-rigging Airdrop System (RRDAS).  Component I ALVADS EPJS has already achieved a MS C Decision and has been initially fielded.  Component IV ALVADS ACPRS is currently pursuing a MS C, Type Classification and Full Materiel Release Decision.  Based on the US Army Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) priorities list for ALVADS and the recent decision to combine the Light and Heavy requirements, ALVADS Light/Heavy capability is the next priority.  The Government anticipates awarding several Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the base effort with a down select to one for the remaining portion of the contract.  Funds will be obligated for quantities ordered upon issuance of delivery orders and not by the basic contract.  The contract guaranteed minimum is $80,000.00.  The contract maximum shall not exceed $15,000,000.00.  Market Research has been conducted by technical experts, and has shown that this requirement will be procured under Full and Open Competition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 314999.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code is 2399 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. Anticipated RFP Release on the Natick Contracting Division's website https://www3.natick.army.mil will be on or about July 11th 2013.  Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Roberta Boswell, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at roberta.f.boswell.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Vaccine Branch Flow Cytometry Core, plans to procure on a sole source basis the MoFlo Astrios w/intellisort II from Beckman Coulter, 11800 SW 147th Ave, Miami, FL 33196.
<p><br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(2). The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>Delivery Date: 90 days from date of award.</p>
<p>The NCI CCR, Vaccine Branch Flow Cytometry Core was created in Bldg 41 to fulfill an urgent, unmet need on NCI's Bethesda campus for a Core with BL2/BL3 containment, able to safely sort live cells infected with retroviruses, such as HIV/SIV, and other infectious agents known or suspected in blood and tissue samples. The VB Flow Cytometry Core also supports multiple flow cytometry applications including: cell sorting of both infectious samples (HIV, SIV, HTLV) and non-infectious samples, multi-color immunophenotyping, cell cycle analysis, proliferation analysis (Ki67, PCNA, BrdU, CFSE), apoptosis measurement (Annexin V, JC1, Active Caspase 3, TUNEL), intracellular cytokine analysis, stem cell analysis and sorting, calcium flux analysis, bead array analysis of soluble proteins, phosphorylated protein analysis, fluorescent protein analysis and sorting, side population cell sorting and quantitative flow cytometry. The VB Flow Cytometry Core currently supports CCR investigators from 13branches including the Vaccine Branch, the Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, and the Cancer Genetics Branch.</p>
<p>The VB Flow Cytometry Core is currently equipped with one FACSAria II cell sorter. The FACSAria II is configured with 488 nm, 640 nm, and 405 nm lasers and 12-color capability for cell sorting. This laser configuration does not allow for cell sorting of samples utilizing the fluorescent fruit proteins (such as mCherry) that have become popular with CCR investigators due to the ability to use this label in assays along with other commonly used labels but can only be sorted on Flow Cytometry Core cell sorters in Building 37. There is an urgent and compelling need for another Core cell sorter in Building 41 with the 561 nm laser needed for this type of cell sorting.</p>
<p>The VB Flow Cytometry Core has been approved by CCR to purchase of a new cell sorter using Resource Request System funds. VB hopes to use the instrument to identify novel subsets of submicron biological particles, 1) for use as diagnostic biomarkers of disease and treatment responses, and 2) to discover characteristics of those particles that will enable the development of new therapies (vaccines or other targeted therapies) for cancers, immune disorders, and infections diseases. This cell sorter needs to be equipped with 488 nm, 561nm, 640nm and 405nm lasers, 18 color capability, index sorting into 96-well plates, and a biological safety cabinet for infectious single cell sorting, because several users in the Vaccine Branch will use the instrument for human and non-human primate infectious specimens.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting cell sorting of infectious cells and samples expressing fluorescent fruit proteins, this cell sorter needs to support the new nanoFACS application currently being developed at NCI. The Beckman Coulter AstriosEQ cell sorter is the only commercially available cell sorter with the sensitivity needed to detect particles in the 80-100 nm ranged required for the nanoFACS application.<br /><br />Contractor Requirements are:</p>
<p>The cell sorter to be purchased for the Vaccine Branch Flow Cytometry Core Facility must also meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Dual multi-fiber Beam Shaping Optic (BSO) for fiber coupled lasers (reduces footprint, improves beam characteristics, and simplifies alignment) <br />&bull; Supports two independent FSC channels, FSC-1 and FSC-2 with multiple mask selection for application-specific setup <br />&bull; FSC PMTs provide adjustable voltages down to 100V <br />&bull; Voltage &amp; gain settings stored in software protocols and FCS files and displayed in a new Mini-Pod view on the instrument control panel <br />&bull; Minimum threshold trigger of 0.001% <br />&bull; Define and use custom filters fully integrated with the standard filters <br />&bull; Automatically store filter setup in an FCS file for retrieval and application between Astrios Instruments <br />&bull; Display and print instrument filter setup as part of the Run Report extracted from an FCS file <br />&bull; QC criteria and results for each detector available for each POD display <br />&bull; New mini-POD displays two-channel Forward Scatter (FSC) optical path, which supports all of the above features <br />&bull; Selectable factory-masks allow user to adjust small and large particle sensitivity <br />&bull; Seven (7) laser alignment through only two (2) alignment stages for quick sorter setup <br />&bull; Flat-Top beam profile on fiber coupled lasers increases beam stability and power, alignment ease <br />&bull; Touch Screen Control Panel for instrument set up and sort monitoring (intuitive operation and cross-training) <br />&bull; Auto Start Up enables lasers to automatically turn on and fluidics to pressurize (time savings) <br />&bull; Bead-less drop delay determination and monitoring (fewer foreign particles in the fluid line that carries the sample) <br />&bull; Single button Auto QC with enhanced troubleshooting guidance <br />&bull; Sort chamber free of hard edges designed for aerosol containment and cleanability <br />&bull; Aerosol Evacuation System (AES) pulling particulates from three (3) chambers with verified performance to meet the ISAC guidelines <br />&bull; SmartSampler sample tube input from 0.5ml to 50ml with optional temperature control (largest sample input range) <br />&bull; Quick Release nozzle design for easy access to nozzle tip <br />&bull; Electronic capability to simultaneously detect 32 parameters (32 bit processing and 100 MHz sampling speeds); Zero electronic dead time equates to no hard aborts. <br />&bull; Only sorter capable of &gt;70,000 sort decisions/second validated performance <br />&bull; &gt;100,000 acquisition rate/second validated performance <br />&bull; Mixed Mode sorting: only sorter where each sort stream is capable of having its own sort mode (Enrich, Purify, Single) programmed.

<p>The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 811219 - with a size standard of $19M in revenue.</p>
<p>This Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being request and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  NO SPECIFICATIONS OR DRAWINGS ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  

A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to obtain contractor qualifications for which the resulting contract, by means of a negotiated firm fixed-price procurement, will be awarded.  The solicitation will be advertised as Unrestricted Full and Open Competition.  Formal source selection procedures will be followed to award to the Best Value Source Selection (BVSS) offeror as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 as applicable.  The contract will be procured using competitive proposals as it has been determined in accordance with FAR 6.401 to be the most appropriate method of contracting for the subject project.

This solicitation will be issued as N40085-14-R-3507.

The awarded contract will be a DESIGN/BID/BUILD CONSTRUCTION PROJECT FOR P-266 STRUCTURAL SHOPS CONSOLIDATION, LOCATED AT THE PORTSMOUTH NAVAL SHIPYARD BASE KITTERY, MAINE.

Project Description: 
 
The project will construct a new addition in the center of Building 76 and will include shop space, personnel support areas, and storage.
 

Facility and infrastructure renovations for buildings 75 and 76 will meet industrial shop equipment requirements and bring facilities up to current building codes.   Renovations will include upgrades to the following systems: electrical (e.g. power, grounding, etc.), mechanical (e.g. ventilation, dust collection, etc.), plumbing (e.g. compressed air, gases, water, etc.), and fire protection and life safety (e.g. fire separation, sprinklers, and storage and venting of hazardous materials, etc.).   New special foundations will also be provided for relocation of industrial shop equipment.  Existing office HVAC will be upgraded with more efficient variable refrigerant systems. Industrial ventilation will be upgraded to satisfy process requirements and maximize heat recovery.
  New make-up air systems will be installed separating industrial and administrative functions.  Renovations of Buildings 75 and 76 will also include exterior window, masonry wall, and roof repairs.  Exterior building repairs will be completed in accordance with the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties. 

The existing LAN, located in building 46, will need to remain undisturbed and operational during demolition and construction activities.  The existing CIA fence line and turnstiles will be relocated to accommodate transfer of material from Building 75. 

The magnitude of construction for this project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. 

The Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 236210.

Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider.
 Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed/renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS is forthcoming.

This contract will establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability that is considered essential be meet current and future Navy requirements.  Maintaining this capability is critical for the continued development of these highly specialized AUVs especially at is relates to both mid to deep range systems.

WHOI is also the only known institution that can launch and recover large AUVs through a moon pool.  

This contract will only cover developmental versions of AUVs.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. Therefore this requirement is intended for Northrop Grumman (76823). -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

<DESC><p>The U.S. Mission in Afghanistan has established a strategy and performance monitoring plan for all U.S. government activities to ensure that results are being achieved. Development Objective 1 is a "Foundation Created for Sustainable, Agricultural-led Economic Growth". A key Intermediate Result for achieving this Development Objective is a "Vibrant and Prosperous Agriculture Sector Developed". The Regional Agricultural Development Program (RADP) is working towards this intermediate result.</p>
<p>The goal of the RADP is to "Improve food and economic security for rural Afghans in targeted areas by improving the productivity and profitability of targeted value chains". RADP supports the consolidation of licit economies to fuel economic growth, including providing alternatives to poppy cultivation.</p>
<p>RADP-E is expected be the fourth of five contracts to be awarded under the RADP. The focus will be on improving the productivity and profitability of targeted value chains to be selected from within the fruits, nuts, cereals, livestock, and vegetable sectors. RADP-E will utilize interventions that facilitate improvements in how markets function without taking over functions within the market.</p>
<p>RADP-E is expected to be a performance-based, five-year contract, commencing in approximately December 2014, with a total estimated cost of $48,000,000 - $58,000,000. The activity will focus on Nangarhar, Logar, Laghman, Kapisa, Parwan, Wardak, Ghazni, and Kabul provinces. The eight provinces selected for RADP-E are part of the Eastern Regional Economic Zone.</p>
<p>The contractor will be expected to provide wide-ranging consultant services to identify end-market opportunities and link value chain actors to identified opportunities, strengthen vertical and horizontal linkages and relationships in selected value chains, and strengthen input supply and other supporting services and improve farmer access to these interconnected markets.</p>
<p>Objective and illustrative list of deliverables:</p>
<p>&bull; Develop inclusive, self-sustaining agricultural markets which increase incomes for Afghan farmers<br />a) Provision of market analysis for selected value chains, including an end market analysis <br />b) Production of causal models and theory of change for each selected value chain<br />c) Completion of a baseline survey for each selected value chain<br />d) Production of strategic frameworks for each value chain, including interventions, targets, and exit strategy <br />e) Implementation of interventions within strategic frameworks<br />f) Development of a performance monitoring plan including systematic change indicators<br />g) Development of a knowledge capture system for tacit and explicit knowledge<br />h) Development of quantitative and qualitative data collection tools</p>
<p>Illustrative example of potential contractor services:</p>
<p><em>The USAID-funded Zambia Production, Finance and Improved Technologies (PROFIT) program increased incomes for 143,000 farmers of maize, beans, and groundnut by 273%. Instead of working directly with farmers, the project identified market participants, commercial input suppliers, which viewed farmers as potential customers and therefore saw a win-win relationship with farmers. Input suppliers saw that if farmers' yields and profits increased then their need for additional products would increase. Even with this potential, input suppliers faced inherent risks of trying to provide services in a dispersed network of smallholder farmers. The program used "smart subsidies" to work with the commercial input suppliers to create a cadre of for-profit input supply agents operating in villages and towns. The commercial input suppliers provided product training to the agents along with a supply of inputs and the agents provided feedback from the farmers to the commercial input suppliers. The PROFIT project did not become part of the market by delivering services directly but instead worked with input suppliers and agents to understand their risks and incentives to create an agent network that would last beyond the life of the project.<br /></em></p>
<p><strong>******<br /><br />Issuance of this notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal.&nbsp; </strong>In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.201.</p>
<p>All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package, which will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov, no less than 15 days after this notice. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement. Telephonic requests or inquiries will not be taken.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLICIT USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: This is notice of intent for the General Services Administration to solicit space for the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Farm Service Administration (FSA) located at Edgecombe County Administration Building, 201 St. Andrews Street, Tarboro, NC from the current lessor. The Government will negotiate a lease contract at the existing location and consider an alternate space only if economically advantageous. This is due to the economic benefit of cost avoidance of relocation costs for personal property and telecommunications equipment, tenant improvement costs not expected to be recovered through full and open competition, and the impact of disruption to lessee. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Government will negotiate with the current lessor to lease for the USDA 5,307 rentable square feet of office, storage, and related space. Space must be "as is" and in "move in" condition.
<p>REQUIRED: All services, supplies, utilities, and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.</p>
<p><span style="TEXT-TRANSFORM: uppercase">Occupancy</span>: The space is required on or before May 9, 2014.</p>
<p>TERM: 10 years total - first 5 years firm. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

Ensure responses are structured and clearly labeled in the same order as outlined in the above mentioned key requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming should be provided.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />4.&nbsp;Interested parties&nbsp;responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are an other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone).

This notice is part of government market research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the "art of the possible" and associated material procurement and approach risks from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies and implementation possibilities. The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. If it is determined to be a small business set-aside, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting will apply. Therefore, small businesses that want to be considered for a small business set-aside should demonstrate how they could comply. Potential sources are encouraged to submit recommended small business utilization requirements as a percentage of total contract value for consideration, in the event the acquisition is not set-aside for small business.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />6.

Any material that is not marked proprietary will be considered publicly-releasable. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />7. When submitting a response, please be aware that the Air Force workforce is supplemented by contracted support personnel.

<a href="mailto:emily.kundel@us.army.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT to identify sources interested in producing the M201A1 (and variants) pyrotechnic delay fuzes.  <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) is conducting a market survey of industry to identify sources interested in manufacturing the subject fuzes.  <br>  <br> TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Fuze, Hand Grenade, M201A1, NSN 1330-00-293-9516, DODIC G874. The M201A1 is a pyrotechnic delay igniting fuze used on M18/M83 smoke grenades and AN-M14 incendiary grenade.  The fuze is equipped with a steel safety Pin and Pull Ring. The safety pin is removed to arm the grenade while holding the lever tight to the grenade body. When the lever is released, the spring-loaded striker rotates and initiates the primer.  The primer ignites a delay element, which initiates the igniter.  The igniter then activates the smoke mix or thermate mix achieving the desired signal, screening effect, and/or heat output.  Variants of the M201A1 fuze include, but are not limited to, the M208 fuze for the M8 smoke pot and M201A1 MOD3 fuze the new SOD-VR smoke grenade.  VARIANT 1:  Fuze, Smoke Pot, M208, NSN 1365-01-564-8799, DODIC K885.  The M208 ignites the smoke mixture within the M8 Floating Smoke Pot.  VARIANT 2: Fuze, Hand Grenade, M201A1 MOD3, NSN 1330-01-603-9230, DODIC GG35.  Like the M208, the M201A1 MOD3 differs only slightly from the M201A1 fuze. The M201A1 MOD3 ignites the burster tube in the M106 SOD-VR grenade. This market survey is for information purposes only to identify sources that are interested in manufacturing any or all of the above components and not a request for proposal or an announcement of a solicitation.  The NAICS code for this item is 332993 with a business size standard of 1500 employees.  Please indicate your business size in your response.  <br>  <br>  <br> ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS:  The following requirements are provided for the purposes of this survey.  Estimated requirements are expected to be from 1.5M to 2.0M fuzes over a five (5) year period to support the Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) requirements of the government and the order may be split between 2 vendors.  M201A1 requirements comprise well over 95% of the total.  M208 requirements comprise less than 1%.  M201A1 MOD3 requirements will comprise less than 2%.  The work might also include some engineering or product improvement efforts which might arise from technology insertion or standardization requirements. <br>  <br> A respondent to this market survey should be able to show that they have adequate technical capability, manufacturing capacity, certification to receive export-controlled technical data (as applicable), and good past performance record in the pyrotechnic processing industry as an indicator of qualifications.   <br>  <br> EXPORT RESTRICTIONS:  The drawings for this requirement are restricted.

<p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is issuing this sources sought RFI as a means of conducting market research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the market research is to obtain feedback from interested contractors regarding the current plan for competition for the Global Network Services (GNS) procurement and to notify prospective contractors of specific ALLA/NALLA requirements. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>GNS will primarily be a transport services contract, but with the ability to purchase end-to-end solutions as the customer requires.</p>
<p>DISA is planning to compete GNS as a global, multiple award IDIQ with the potential to cover all DISA theaters of operation: <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Americas </strong>(North America and South America), <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Europe</strong> (Europe and Africa), <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">PAC</strong>, and <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">CENT</strong> (Southwest Asia). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Interested contractors are asked to review and respond to the RFI questions below. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The results of this market research will contribute to determining the GNS procurement approach.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background/Scope: <br /></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 3pt 0in 6pt; mso-add-space: auto"><br />The DISN is comprised of owned and leased telecommunication networks, subsystems, and operations support. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Leased services include voice, data, video and other telecommunications and network management services transported via landline circuits, undersea cables, wireless, and satellite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These services are currently procured under several distinct contracts, including DISN Access Transport Services (DATS) [HC1013-07-D-2005, HC1013-07-D-2006, HC1013-07-D-2007], DISN Transmission Services - Pacific II (DTS-PII) [HC1019-09-D-2000], Joint Hawaii Information Transfer System (JHITS) [HC1019-06-D-2002], GSA Networx PLS [GS00T07NSD00], Transoceanic Optical Transport - Atlantic (TOT-A) [DCA200-92-H-0104], Transoceanic Optical Transport - Pacific (TOT-P) [DCA200-92-H-0104], Hawaii Terrestrial Transport - Pacific (HTT-P) [DCA200-92-H-0104], and Alaska Infrastructure Project (AKIP) [DCA200-92-H-0104]. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 3pt 0in 6pt; mso-add-space: auto">&nbsp;GNS is being developed as a new contract vehicle to support the global telecommunications/transport requirements of the current and future DISN. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>GNS will align with the goals of the Joint Information Environment (JIE) initiative to provide Unified Capabilities and a secure, global, integrated mesh architecture to provide seamless performance across contract boundaries.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto">To support operations in Europe, DISA is bound by ALLA/NALLA requirements. Based on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Alliance telecommunication contract requirements, if one or more of the end points of a circuit terminates in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) country the Telecommunications Provider (TP) must be an accredited NALLA provider for that country.</p>

<DESC>Fiscal Service on behalf of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) intends to award an Order to GitHub Inc. on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for GitHub Enterprise Licenses.<br />Github Enterprise (GE) is a web-based, project management and source code control software used by software developers. GE resides behind CFPB's firewall, and includes such features as issue tracking, collaborative code review and assignment, documentation and permissions, which when combined allow a software developer to manage an entire team of software developers working on a particular project. The source code is vital to the development of all of CFPB's software applications featured on its website. GE also allows CFPB to publish its open source code to Git, which enables users in the public domain to use the open source code. CFPB needs a project and source code development management software to effectively and efficiently continue its software development, and continue to push source code to the public domain. Ceasing pushing source code to public domain would be a violation from CFPB's Source Code Policy, available here: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/.
<p><br />Additionally, GE features two-factor security authentication. The authentication prevents unauthorized access to CFPB's GE account and its proprietary, non-public source code. Any product used by CFPB for source code and project management must utilize two-factor authentication for its security procedures.</p>
<p>Since the launch of CFPB, the Technology and Innovation (T&amp;I) division has used Git and GE for its source code management and software development process. Currently, CFPB has thousands of lines of programming code<br />contained in 10 public and 100 internal repositories in both GE and Git. Switching to another source code management framework or software would require this code to be copied and retested before being deployed, and<br />force CFPB to restructure and write new standard procedures for its Development team. At least sixty (60) different CFPB employees at any given time have been working on writing source code into GE and Git since CFPB's inception. CFPB has been writing source code into GE and Git since 2011. It is estimated it would take a similar number of resources a minimum of six (6) months to move the source code over to new software. During which time CFPB would not be able to take on new software development projects, as the resources that would handle the coding of those projects would be dedicated to transferring source code to the new repository. Such changes would carry a significant administrative burden, and would ultimately be detrimental to the CFPB development team's ability to develop and maintain software code.</p>
<p>Therefore, Github Enterprise is the only software capable of meeting CFPB's needs. This software is only available through the manufacturer, GitHub, Inc. Accordingly, GitHub, Inc. is the only source capable of meeting CFPB's needs.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by December 16, 2013 by 2:00 pm ET. Responses shall be submitted to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, ATTN: K. Mahurin/ C. Gropp.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of this notice is to advertise the opportunity to LEASE the Historic Grant  Building and some surrounding area on the gated Washington, DC Campus of the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH). This 169,006 square foot building located, just minutes from the Capital, at 3700   North Capital Street, NW, was built in 1910 as a dining hall and dormitory, which housed 2 to 4 men per room (meaning fairly large rooms).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The surrounding campus and area offer a fair amount of amenities. The open historic campus is secured by a perimeter fence and a security controlled gate. Large parking lots are located on campus that can accommodate motorist. Three city bus route stops are located at the main gate to the campus and the metro is within 1200 yards (less than 3/4 of a mile). Within a mile and half of the Grant Building, approximately 250,000 square feet of retail space and 1500 residential units are being built or started within the next three years. The attachments provide more details related to the building and surrounding area.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Any interested party in the lease of the Grant  Building shall be allowed to renovate/modify the facility and surrounding area within the guidelines and restrictions of the historic and applicable building code requirements along with any pertinent federal regulations and AFRH policies. All interested parties may contact AFRH for tours and any information or data that is available and that the perspective deems useful.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By the response deadline, all interested parties shall propose their concept for usage, renovation and occupancy timelines, and approximate rental fee structure and amounts that will be paid to AFRH. After the response deadline, AFRH will narrow the list down to 2 or more plausible and compatible concepts that fit best with AFRHs needs and campus. After AFRH has narrowed down the list, the remaining interested parties will be interviewed. After the interview or interviews, AFRH will narrow the list to one interested party. That party will be put in contact with the Corp. of Engineers (the leasing agent and property managers for AFRH) for negotiations and lease award.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">AFRH encourages the interested parties to be creative. We are open to all ideas and rental fee concepts. We understand that the Grant Building will require repairs and modifications, and we are willing and expecting to allow the developer to defer rental payments to offset the cost to make the Grant Building and surrounding area a usable product that can be profitable (this deferred payment concept is also known as &ldquo;in-kind consideration&rdquo; as described in the AFRH Legislation U.S.C. Title 24, Chapter 10, Subchapter I, Section 411 (i))</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">AFRH is an independent government agency with the authority to lease real property to generate revenue for its trust fund. The United States Congress established the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) as a separate federal agency in 1991 when it enacted the Defense Authorization Act, Public Law 101-510.&nbsp; AFRH is the only Federal Agency that does not receive tax payer funds for every day operation. The Agency&rsquo;s source of income flows from the enlisted men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States through a small payroll deduction and forfeitures. In addition to the contributions from enlisted personnel, AFRH enjoys donations from generous individuals and the interest income from a trust fund established in 1855 for the Forefather to AFRH, the United States Soldiers Home.&nbsp; While the total number of residents varies from month-to-month, AFRH provides a home for approximately 600 former enlisted personnel in their retirement years at both the Gulfport and Washington campuses. This Home provides retired veterans with the common daily living needs such as: private rooms, bank, chapel, convenience store, mail room, laundry facilities, barber/beauty shop, dining facility, and a 24-hour security and staff presence. In addition to these common needs, AFRH offers social, recreational, and occupational activities for many interests. While residents live in this community, AFRH provides for their overall health care needs in a high quality manner; including on site primary care, medical care, and a continuum of long-term care services as residents transition from independent living. Our residents found it to be an honor to serve our country. AFRH finds it to be an honor to serve them now.</p>

The United States Congress established the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) as a separate federal agency in 1991 when it enacted the Defense Authorization Act, Public Law 101-510.&nbsp; AFRH is the only Federal Agency that does not receive tax payer funds for every day operation. The Agency&rsquo;s source of income flows from the enlisted men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States through a small payroll deduction and forfeitures. In addition to the contributions from enlisted personnel, AFRH enjoys donations from generous individuals and the interest income from a trust fund established in 1855 for the Forefather to AFRH, the United States Soldiers Home.&nbsp; While the total number of residents varies from month-to-month, AFRH provides a home for approximately 600 former enlisted personnel in their retirement years at both the Gulfport and Washington campuses. This Home provides retired veterans with the common daily living needs such as: private rooms, bank, chapel, convenience store, mail room, laundry facilities, barber/beauty shop, dining facility, and a 24-hour security and staff presence. In addition to these common needs, AFRH offers social, recreational, and occupational activities for many interests. While residents live in this community, AFRH provides for their overall health care needs in a high quality manner; including on site primary care, medical care, and a continuum of long-term care services as residents transition from independent living. Our residents found it to be an honor to serve our country. AFRH finds it to be an honor to serve them now.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed an insulation technology, which combines the superb heat resistance and dielectric properties of Langleys RP46 polyimide with glass or quartz fibers or fabric. RP46, developed at NASA, exhibits high mechanical strength and structural durability at elevated temperatures. It also features significantly less moisture absorption and is therefore less susceptible to moisture-induced damage. RP46 demonstrates excellent thermal oxidative stability and chemical corrosion resistance. The advantage of using glass or quartz fiber reinforcement is their ability to maintain physical integrity over a wide range of temperature, humidity, voltage, and frequency. A copper or aluminum bus pipe insulated with the new insulation material withstood several rounds of 3-hour gas flame tests, each time being exposed to temperatures between 2,100F and 2,300F. No fire or fuse failure was observed. Results show that the insulated bus pipe has the ability to maintain both structural and electrical circuit integrity in extreme and corrosive environments. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at http://technology.nasa.gov/. These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development (OSACB) for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a high output flame in support of the efforts to design a jet engine simulator for infrared plume studies. Previous tests had shown that off-the-shelf components would melt or burn up in a short time. Given these design and performance criteria, NASA developed a ceramic flame holder that has a much longer life cycle and can be used with a variety of torches or burners. Where the stainless flame holders showed signs of oxidation, flaking after only three hours of testing, NASAs ceramic flame holder has over 150 hours and 200 cycles of use in a casting furnace, and soot marks are the only signs of use; there are no signs of deterioration.

<DESC>Synopsis: NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a novel approach for active jet nozzle flow effectors, or chevrons, based upon shape memory alloy hybrid composite (SMAHC) technology. The concept involves embedding pre-strained SMA actuators on one side of the chevron neutral axis in order to generate a thermal moment and deflect the structure out of plane when heated. The force developed in the host structure during deflection and the aerodynamic loads are used for returning the structure to the retracted position. The NASA chevron design is highly scalable and versatile, and easily affords active and/or autonomous (environmental) control. Prototype chevrons at 1:9 scale have been built and tested, including thermal cycling tests, repeatability tests, and tests with representative flow conditions at NASA Langley. All aspects of the chevron performance were found to be very repeatable, including closed loop performance of the chevron tip to prescribed positions while immersing into and retracting from the flow.

<DESC>Synopsis: NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed NASA Langley has created a modified electrospinning apparatus for spinning highly aligned polymer fibers and also a companion simulation software program that helps tailor the process for a particular application. Fiber placement is difficult to control in conventional electrospinning, which creates randomly oriented fibers that are well suited to nonwoven mats, but not to other applications. Now, NASA Langley has developed an auxiliary electrode that creates an opposing electric field to control the alignment and porosity of fibers for mats. The new apparatus and its companion software will enable the production of single fibers and mats of micro- and nano-fibers with controlled orientation, and allow controlled orientation of the fiber lay-up for multiple layers of fiber to form a thicker mat.  The process begins when a pump slowly expels polymer solution through the tip of the spinneret at a set flow rate as a positive charge is applied. The auxiliary electrode, which is negatively charged, is positioned opposite the charged spinneret. The disparity in charges creates an electric field that effectively controls the polymer jet behavior as it is expelled from the spinneret and ultimately the distribution of the fibers and mats formed from the polymer solution as it lands on the rotating collection mandrel. Modifying various parameters of the process and/or polymer solution can make a broad range of fiber diameters. The companion simulation software provides the optimal spin parameters, such as electrical field distribution and fiber trajectory, for a particular fiber application.  Performance data has confirmed the substantial role that the electric field plays in the significant improvement in fiber alignment and control relative to using the rotating collector alone. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.

<DESC>Synopsis: NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed NASA Langley has developed a new non-destructive method for characterizing nanomaterials. Based on modified atomic force ultrasonic microscopy (AFUM) methods, the technology allows imaging and quantifying of material properties at the surface and subsurface levels. NASA developed the technology to reveal the orientation of nanotubes within a composite structure. The technology offers the ability to determine subsurface characteristics without destroying the nanomaterial structure. The method is widely applicable for basic nanomaterials characterization, including distribution and orientation of particles in a nanocomposite, localized elastic constants and changes in elastic constants, adhesive surface properties, sound velocity, and material damping coefficient. This new scanning probe microscope methodology is called resonant difference frequency atomic force ultrasonic microscopy (RDF-AFUM). It employs an ultrasonic wave launched from the bottom of a sample while the cantilever of an atomic force microscope engages the sample top surface. The cantilever is driven at a frequency differing from the ultrasonic frequency by one of the contact resonance frequencies of the cantilever. The nonlinear mixing of the oscillating cantilever and the ultrasonic wave at the sample surface generates difference-frequency oscillations at the cantilever contact resonance. The resonance-enhanced difference-frequency signals are used to create amplitude and phase-generated images of nanoscale near-surface and subsurface features. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at http://technology.nasa.gov/. These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development (OSACB) for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<DESC>Proposed Synopsis for Green Delta Tech Modification 2:
Synopsis for the proposed modification to Purchase Order EP-12-C-000094 - Continued Development and Modification of OpenLCA Open Source Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Software and Database Framework
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD), and the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) located in Cincinnati, OH awarded Purchase Order EP-12-C-000094 under FAR 12 & 13 procedures to Green Delta TC on 07/03/2012.  This purchase order was previously synopsized and modified for similar reasons on 08/14/2013
The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A), with Green Delta TC to modify Purchase Order EP-12-C-000094, increasing the scope of work to provide support for the continued development of OpenLCA and modifications necessary for the system to meet the demands of the next stage of research.  Green Delta TC is the original developer of OpenLCA and is the owner of OpenLCA SourceForge open source software.
The overall objective of this modification is to implement a generic user interface and functionality to allow for the development of application-specific, non-expert user interfaces for interacting with life cycle assessment models and address high priority items related to the basic functionality of OpenLCA and the attractiveness of OpenLCA to a broader pool of open source software developers. 
Specific work that will be added to this order will include the following: ?	Edit the OpenLCA Modifications Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP ?	Utilize publicly available data and data previously developed for the Tool for Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) to create a U.S. input-output life cycle assessment dataset suitable for use in OpenLCA. ?	Create a version of the SMM Tool IO-LCA database modified to reflect Georgia-specific conditions. ?	Create a functional version of the Tool for Sustainable Materials Management implemented in OpenLCA. ?	Create unit process datasets for use in OpenLCA in support of the implementation of WARM in OpenLCA. ?	Integrate existing code with openLCA to create an openLCA module for RDF-based data exchange, map the RDF database/ontology onto the openLCA relational database, and add functionality to allow writing from the triplestore database to openLCA ?	Modify the OpenLCA-integrated version of the LCA Harmonization Tool (outcome of Task 6) to allow for the transfer of data directly from OpenLCA to the triplestore database via the LCA Harmonization Tool interface. Modify LCA Harmonization Tool Java code to ensure proper functioning of the harmonization routines and interface for OpenLCA to LCA-HT triplestore . In addition, the EPA seeks to negotiate pricing for the following optional items: ?	Incorporate user feedback to improve the intuitiveness and workflow of the OpenLCA-based Tool for Sustainable Materials Management ?	Implement new routines to model advanced scenarios in the Tool for Sustainable Materials Management. ?	Integrate unit processes to better represent sub-sector level processes into the SMM Tool LCA database using existing unit process data if available or through creating new unit process data if not. ?	Create materials accessible from within the OpenLCA-based Tool for Sustainable Materials Management to assist a new user to operate the system. ?	Create a procedure to automate the import of data from process models/descriptions into OpenLCA unit processes. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) seeks interested parties for commercializing remediation technologies.  Sandia has developed a shaped body formed of a crystalline molecular sieve powder. The shaped body, which may be composed of crystalline porous materials such as zeolites, molecular sieves, clays and metal-organic framework (MOF), retains the sorption capacity and accessible surface area of the initial synthesized crystalline powder product.  The technology is described in further detail in US patent 8,262,950. Additional US patents are pending.  The technology developed by Sandia is able to remediate ions from solution, light gases (such as H2, CO2, CH4), and small chain length hydrocarbons.  Sandia seeks licensees to manufacture and/or deploy this technology as an alternative to highly static powders used in engineering separations processes that might cause environmental health and safety concerns to workers.  The Sandia-developed technology can be utilized for clean-up at mining, electrorefining and construction sites and in other industries that make use of heavy metal ion remediation processes. Furthermore, it could benefit clean-up efforts in nuclear energy and processing sites in which accidents, spills and remediation of plant operations may need (1) dissolved radiological ions separated and stored from complex aqueous streams, and/or (2) fission gases separated and stored such as I2, Kr, Xe from complex gas streams. In related technological methods, the shaped form could be applied to separate light gases from chemical and petrochemical processes, such as syngas production, as well as in catalytic reaction beds as a means for avoiding dust and powder dispersion of catalytic materials in process.<br /><br />Sandia seeks to license this technology as part of its technology transfer mission for the benefit of the environment and the US economy.<br /><br />Qualified parties include companies with the capability to manufacture the molecular sieves and offer them for use/sale. Sandia will evaluate responses and select prospective partner(s) based on the following criteria, pursuant to Sandia's technology transfer mission. 1) The respondent's specific capabilities and resources relative to this technology; 2) The respondent's ability to deploy the technology for the benefit of national security and the US public good; and 3) the respondent's ability to use the technology to benefit US economic competitiveness.<br /><br />Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: The Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection process will be used. Offeror's technical proposal will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. Only the lowest priced offer will be evaluated for technical acceptability. In addition, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. By submission of its offer, the offeror agrees to all solicitation requirements. This includes the terms and conditions, representations and certifications, technical requirements, and funds in the solicitation and all attachments. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined non-responsive and thereby excluded from any further consideration. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. PRICE PROPOSAL<br />(1) Offerors will be evaluated on their entire contract price inclusive of options as indicated in paragraph (2) of this provision.<br />(2) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>B. TECHNICAL</p>
<p>Offerors must submit with their proposal their technical approach for meeting the requirements of the Performance of Work Statement (PWS). This should entail the offerors expected full time equivalent (FTE's), labor categories, qualifications, and management approach to meeting the requirements of the PWS. The technical portion will be graded on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.</p>
<p>Manning Levels <br />Labor Catagories</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information to ensure a proper technical evaluation.</p>
<p>Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revisions. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>

<p>(e) Any adjustment will be limited to increases or decreases in wages and fringe benefits as described in paragraph (d) of this clause, and the accompanying increases or decreases in social security and unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but shall not otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any increase claimed under this clause within 30 days after receiving a new wage determination unless this notification period is extended in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of any decrease under this clause, but nothing in the clause shall preclude the Government from asserting a claim within the period permitted by law. The notice shall contain a statement of the amount claimed and the change in fixed hourly rates (if this is a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract), and any relevant supporting data, including payroll records, that the Contracting Officer may reasonably require. Upon agreement of the parties, the contract price, contract unit price labor rates, or fixed hourly rates shall be modified in writing. The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment and its effective date.</p>
<p>(g) The Contracting Officer or an authorized representative shall have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the Contractor until the expiration of 3 years after final payment under the contract. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph<br />(c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the <br />Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and <br />Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>

A "deficiency" is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.
Evaluation Criteria/Weighting:        
    
Acceptable	If a Proposal shows that the Offeror meets evaluation standards and weaknesses are readily corrected.  Good probability of success. Exceeds the minimum standard requirements for a given rating factor, it should be rated as "Acceptable".
Unacceptable	If a Proposal shows that the Offeror fails to meet the minimum requirements of the RFQ and the deficiency is not correctable without a major revision of the proposal, it should be rated as "Unacceptable".

The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined below. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, sister or subsidiary companies of the same parent company, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</span></p>

<DESC>The GSA Center for Innovative Acquisition Development is currently reconfiguring its Financial and Business Solutions Schedule (Schedule 520) offer intake system.  As such, we will temporarily postpone accepting any new Financial and Business Solution (FABS) offers at this time.  For those companies that already have an offer in house or that have modifications to their existing contract, or if their contract is up for renewal, those will still be processed accordingly.  Should you have any further questions, please contact Mr. Bruce Spainhour, Director, Center for Innovative Acquisition Development at (703)605-2823 or by email at bruce.spainhour@gsa.gov

The General Services Administration is issuing Refresh 22 to Solicitation Number FCXB-F4-020002-B for Schedule 520 - Financial and Business Solutions. This solicitation was originally synopsized on April 1, 2002, under FCXB-F4-020002-N. Resultant contracts will be indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), multiple award schedule (MAS) contracts under the Federal Supply Schedules program. Contracts awarded under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award and lasting for five years unless cancelled or terminated. The award also includes three five-year option periods.

The scope of services includes the following Special Item Numbers (SINs):

PLEASE NOTE: Effective February 28, 2010, all responses shall be submitted electronically as an eOffer (http://eoffer.gsa.gov). Hard copy responses will no longer be accepted.

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 72 days before your offer is evaluated.

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

ULTRASONIC MODULE, 20W GENERATOR, 60KHZ.  BONDING SOFTWARE  Item 0003  UID LABEL COST (IF ANY).   Flip-chip die attach system  Overview A versatile, accurate die attach system that is capable of less than or equal to 5um accuracy placement, and die attach using ultrasonic and thermal energy is required. The application targeted is one mainly of Thermosonic bonding of gold-bumped die that are 1x1mm in size, and have a small (4-16) number of bumps per die. The application is one of low-volume, prototyping in a laboratory/research environment. The equipment is also called a "flip-chip bonder", "flip-chip aligner/bonder" or a "flip-chip die attach system". Configurability for hot air re-work of printed circuit boards and components is a desirable feature for versatility of the equipment. Capability to be configured as a dispense module for epoxy die attach, and precise die bonding face up is also a desirable feature. This section covers the basic set of specifications that a flip-chip die attach system must meet: Process: The equipment must be capable of the following process: Thermosonic bonding process for gold-bumped tiny die: The die in this process are gold stud bumped. The dies are commonly silicon, but can be sapphire. They are 1x1 mm in size, but can range up to 5x5mm. The dies are picked from waffle or gel packs, and the bumps are aligned with the bond pads on the substrate. The bond pads are commonly gold-coated copper pads. Substrates commonly in use are FR4, LCP, polyimide, or combinations of materials which need to be accommodated up to at least 4x4 inches, with 6x6 inches being desirable.  The substrate is placed on a stage, mechanically clamped and heated. The die is vacuum picked from a waffle or gel-pak container, (die flipping is desirable, but is usually an option and an additional expense) aligned with the substrate pads  (usually using split optics) and brought into contact with the substrate and pads. A known pressure is applied and ultrasonic energy is applied with a time/temperature profile until the gold bumps are fused with the pads. A microscope system that can observe the process in-situ is desirable. Underfills (a liquid epoxy material) may be used subsequent to this process to enhance reliability.  Minimum Specifications:  1. A heated stage with mechanical clamping to firmly hold the substrate in place is required.  2. A holder that can present waffle or gel-packs is needed for die pick- up.  3. A method to flip die from packs to the correct face-down orientation is desired.  4. A die bonding collet with vacuum is required to pick up die and securely hold it during the bonding process. The collet for a 1.1x1.1mm die may or may not be included in the price of the system.  5. An ultrasonic generator and transducer capable of applying enough energy to sufficiently bond the bumped die to the substrate pads.  6. A vision system that shows the substrate pads and die bump alignment is required, along with a means to make fine adjustments in x,y, and theta to achieve correct alignment to 5 microns accuracy.  7. A process capture/management system for process development and statistical process control.   NOTE: QUOTES MUST BE UPLOADED IN THE SPAWAR E-COMMERCE WEBSITE TO BE CONSIDERED.  Basis for award: The government anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price purchase order to the lowest bidder, technically acceptable.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Fac 2005-70, Effective 30 Sep  2013  and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), DPN 20131118 (Effective 18 Nov 2013) Edition.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to the complex emergency in Sudan, OFDA operates an office headquartered at the USAID Mission in Khartoum, Sudan, which is responsible for overseeing more than $80 million OFDA funding in Sudan during fiscal year 2013.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor (SHA) is OFDA's principal humanitarian representative in Sudan and is located in Khartoum.  The Senior Program Officer (SPO) for Sudan supports the SHA by providing program strategy development and implementation oversight.  The SPO oversees field monitoring of OFDA programs and ensures reporting on humanitarian needs and programming in Sudan, to include Darfur, the Three Areas, the East and country-wide issues.  The SPO assists the SHA with assessment, analysis and reporting on existing or evolving crises, maintenance of partner relationships, and coordination of award management activities.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the SHA, the SPO will coordinate closely with USAID Mission and Embassy staff and exchange information regularly with colleagues covering the South Sudan portfolio, as well as with the field and headquarters-based OFDA regional team.  This includes sharing project ideas, strategies, and soliciting advice and guidance. The SPO will also work closely with the Agreement Officer's Representative for all assigned awards.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of one SPO for the Sudan portfolio to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, risk reduction, resilience programming, strategic reporting, and interagency coordination for the region, are met.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OFDA SPO will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of OFDA programming for humanitarian emergency and disaster risk reduction activities throughout Sudan.  The SPO may assist in humanitarian assistance activities elsewhere in the region as needed.</p>
<p>This position requires effective daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices, Embassy staff, and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.  The SPO must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. government disaster assessment team, DART, RMT, or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.</p>
<p>The Senior Program Officer's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as the principal contact point for OFDA programming in Sudan, which includes the Three Areas, the East and Darfur.  Coordinate closely with both field and headquarters-based components of OFDA's Regional Team and maintain regular contact with concerned staff in both the Khartoum and Juba USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>&bull;	Lead OFDA's Sudan-based program staff in the development of OFDA's programming for response and disaster risk reduction activities in Sudan, ensure complementarity between the two strategies, and oversee implementation of each.</p>
<p>&bull;	Continually assess emergency response and disaster risk reduction needs in Sudan in order to ensure that OFDA's programs are appropriately responsive.</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the SHA in maintaining relations with the senior leadership of the Sudan humanitarian community in representing USAID and OFDA on humanitarian issues. This will include but is not limited to UN agencies, IOs, and NGOs, U.S. government personnel, donors, host government authorities, and others.</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel as permitted to assess, evaluate and monitor humanitarian conditions in Sudan, and make strategic recommendations for appropriate interventions.</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate in and report on joint donor humanitarian evaluations and UN-led assessments, and participate actively in the international community response structures.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in Sudan.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /><br /></strong>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKB) at Lackland AFB, TX, has been asked to provide engineering, restoration and construction services to achieve Site Closeout (SC) through remedial action at Scott AFB, Illinois. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 4 September 2013. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, IL for approximately 29 sites. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). Reference the latest SOO dated 4 September 2013 and attachments posted to FEBBIZOPPS for the latest documents. <br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: <br /><br /></strong>The 772 ESS/PKB intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Scott AFB, Illinois. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a firm-fixed price (FFP) pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. This requirement is being issued as a Small Business Set-Aside.<br /><br />NOTE: You are hereby notified that the project owner has certified this project as a valid requirement. Firms will NOT be reimbursed for bid and proposal costs incurred. Therefore, if your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.<br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the third quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's ROM for this PBR is anticipated to be between $30,000,000 and $37,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Mr. Daniel Cevallos, Jr. Email correspondence shall be sent to Mr. Cevallos with a copy to the contract specialists, Ms. Laura Stewart and Ms. Rebecca Robinson. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements</span>: Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Environmental Insurance (EI)</span>: The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonding Capacity</span>: The Air Force is currently proposing to require performance and payment bonds for only the construction portion of this PBR. The bonding required for the construction portion of this effort is anticipated to be 52% of the total estimated contract amount if all options are exercised. An estimated bonding stream is provided to show estimated bonding amounts per year. Note: Bonding may differ from the estimated bonding stream provided based on the proposed technical approach. (Reference Presolicitation FA8903-13-R-0040 RFI documents.)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)</span>: An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers
<p><br />Question<br />Schedule B "Quantity" is listed as 50 and the Unit is listed as "Lot". How does the Quantity of 50 enter into the pricing? Please clarify.</p>
<p>Answer<br />The Quantity of 50 is to help us with the systems we have. We are going to award task orders and because we don't know how many we are going to order we put a bigger number in to make sure we have enough in the long run.</p>
<p><br />Question<br />The PWS specifies tasks that are clearly covered by the Department of Labor Service Contract Act. What Wage Determination is applied to the Solicitation?</p>
<p>Answer<br />These are professional task and we will not be using a Wage Determination.</p>
<p><br />Question<br />Will the safety plan be counted towards the 20 page limit in the technical proposal? Would you like to see an overview description of the safety plan or an entire plan?</p>
<p>Answer<br />The safety plan does not have a page limit.</p>
<p><br />Question<br />Could you tell me what the page limit is for the Past Performance section in solicitation FA8224-14-R-0089?</p>
<p>Answer<br />Past performance is limited to seven recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items over the past three years. There is not a page limit.</p>
<p><br />Question<br />How will this be evaluated during the proposal evaluation process? How do we prove that each person hired will have a Secret Clearance?</p>
<p>Answer<br />The government wants you to tell us how you are going to insure your employees will have Secret Clearance. You won't need to provide names; we just need to know that your employees will be able to get Secret Clearance.</p>
<p><br />Question<br />The SF 33 section B items 0001 - 0005 and 0007 list a quantity of "50" and a unit of "Lot". Items 0101 - 0105 and 0107 list a quantity of "5" and a unit of "Lot". Should this be in units of "Months" and the quantities adjusted to match the POP? If not please define what comprises a "Lot" and identify what constitutes the quantities of "50" and "5" respectively.</p>
<p>Answer<br />The Quantity of 50 is to help us with the systems we have. We are going to award task orders and because we don't know how many we are going to order we put a bigger number in to make sure we have enough in the long run.</p>
<p><br />Question<br />In table 2 Price Proposal spreadsheet there are not estimated hours for the "Master Analyst" which prevents this position from being priced. Please provide the estimated hours for the Master Analyst.</p>
<p>Answer<br />The government doesn't have estimated hours for the Master Analyst but wanted to put it in to make sure if one or two are needed we have the option. The government is just asking for an hourly rate if a master analyst is needed.</p>
<p><br />Question<br />Section L - Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Bidders, paragraph 2 provides the specific PWS paragraphs that will be evaluated for the Part II Technical Proposal. Are we correct to assume these are the only items we are to respond to in the proposal response or does the government want responses to all PWS requirements? Please clarify.</p>
<p>Answer<br />The government wants a response to all the PWS requirements.</p>
<p><br />Question<br />The FedBizOpps notification for this solicitation states "Note: This is a bridge contract to a strategic long term contract. Its estimated this will be a one to two year bridge effort." To what is this bridge contract supporting? Please explain to what strategic long term contract this also refers. This also contradicts the POP of the solicitation. Please clarify.</p>
<p>Answer<br />OO-ALC will have a long term strategic contract for overhead/indirect support for depot operations which will encompass the scope of the NWRM stand alone. This will not affect the POP or usage of the NWRM contract but will be the follow-on long term support required. The new requirement is anticipated in 18 - 24 months.</p>
<p><br />Question<br />PWS Para 8.1 states "The Government intends to convert these services to organic (Government) support at the end of the contract period. " Is this by chance related to the FBO posting referencing this as a bridge contract? (related to question #4 above)</p>
<p>Answer<br />Individual Services rendered are intend to be short term (12 to 24 months) and are intended to be converted to civilian positions. There will be a need for contract support to fill the gaps for differing positions throughout the POP of the contract but they may not be the same workload, bldg., or type (planner, scheduling, PST).</p>
<p><br />Question<br />Is there an incumbent to this contract or is this a new requirement?</p>
<p>New requirement</p>
<p><br />Question<br />Is there a bidder's library? If so please provide all instructions referred to in the PWS to include all command and local supplements.</p>
<p>Answer <br />There is not a bidder's library. All instructions will be posted to FBO.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.<br /><br />Request for Information<br />T-38A/C Forward Canopy Panel Redesign With Through-The-Canopy Ejection Capability, PN-2-13201-49, NSN 1560-00-996-1399<br /><br />This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). This not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.<br /><br />1. Purpose: The purpose of this RFI is to gather comments and identify potential sources, materials, timeframe, and approximate costs to redesign, test, and produce 550 T-38 forward canopy transparencies to increase bird strike capability. This does not require the retention of Through-The-Canopy (TTC) ejection capability.<br /><br />2. Background: The T-38 System Program Office (SPO) requires an industry response regarding innovative or diverse technology to optimize the design for maximum bird impact resistance. The current 0.23 inch thick stretched acrylic transparency can resist a 4-pound bird impact at 165 knots which does not offer a capability to resist significant bird impacts, and has resulted in the loss of six (6) aircraft and two pilot fatalities. Numerous attempts since 1970 were made to evaluate existing materials and redesign a transparency that could withstand a bird impact of 4 pounds at 400 knots. However, the increased transparency thickness proposed to increase bird strike survivability would have required modification of canopy operating mechanisms and the addition of a transparency fracturing system, which significantly increased the cost of the modification. Although it would increase the level of bird impact protection, the proposal was cancelled due to the high cost of the modification.<br /><br />3. Scope of Task: <br />&bull;Develop a new state of the art technology that will optimize the transparency design to maximize bird strike resistance while maintaining a total transparency weight of less than 68 pounds. Maintaining the weight below 68 pounds will negate the need to modify canopy operating mechanisms.

Purpose:&nbsp;The purpose of this RFI is to gather comments and identify potential sources, materials, timeframe, and approximate costs to redesign, test, and produce 550 ea. T-38 forward canopy transparencies to increase bird strike capability while maintaining the existing Through-The-Canopy (TTC) ejection capability.<br /><br />2. Background: The T-38 System Program Office (SPO) requires an industry response regarding innovative or diverse technology that meet, what can only be described as, &lsquo;conflicting' canopy performance needs i.e. maintain TTC capability and increase bird impact resistant capabilities. The current 0.23 inch thick stretched acrylic transparency can resist a 4-pound bird impact at 165 knots which does not offer a capability to resist significant bird impacts, and has resulted in the loss of six (6) aircraft and two pilot fatalities. Numerous attempts since 1970 were made to evaluate existing materials and redesign a transparency that could withstand a bird impact of 4 pounds at 400 knots. However, the increased transparency thickness proposal to increase bird strike survivability would have required modification of canopy operating mechanisms and addition of a transparency fracturing system, which significantly increased the cost of the modification. Although it would increase the level of bird impact protection, the proposal was cancelled due to the high cost of the modification.<br /><br />3. Scope of Task: <br />&bull;Develop a new state of the art technology that will optimize the transparency design to maximize bird strike resistance while maintaining a total transparency weight of less than 68 pounds. Maintaining the weight below 68 pounds will negate the need to modify canopy operating mechanisms and significantly reduce costs. The contractor's response to the RFI should include an estimate of final bird strike resistance. <br />&bull;Redesigned transparency must retain the TTC ejection capability. <br />&bull;Materials must be manufactured in accordance with aviation industry standards, design specifications, requirements, and tolerances.<br />&bull;Incorporate existing transparency to canopy frame, fuselage attachment fitting, and canopy support.<br />&bull;Redesigned transparency should be able to maintain or improve current aircraft optical requirement (Optical requirements must meet approval of qualified FCF pilot), or current industry standards. <br /><br />4.

<DESC>U.S. Army Market Survey - Blast Mitigating Seat Overview <br>  <br> ***NOTE - Please address any questions regarding this Market Survey via email to: usarmy.detroit.redecom.mbx.tardec-gss-ocp@mail.mil <br>   <br>  This document is a U.S. Army Market Survey specifically relating to Blast Mitigating Seat capabilities. The goal of this Market Survey is to provide a mutually beneficial opportunity to understand the U.S. Army's needs regarding blast mitigating seats and the capabilities of commercial blast mitigating seats that may meet those needs. Additional information regarding this survey is provided below. Please address any questions regarding this Market Survey via email to usarmy.detroit.redecom.mbx.tardec-gss-ocp@mail.mil. Use  quote mark Blast Mitigating Seats quote mark  in the subject line and include name, phone number, and email address for response. Questions may be answered via email or phone. We thank you in advance for your time and participation with this Market Survey.  <br>    <br>  I.	Objectives  <br>  A.	This document is a Market Survey for use in the U.S. Army Interior Blast Mitigation Teams' Occupant Centric Platform investigation activities into blast mitigating seats. The objectives of market research are for the U.S. Army to better understand the availability and capabilities of commercial products and the potential of the associated products manufacturers. The information gathered by the U.S. Army through this Market Survey is for internal U.S. Army's use and will not be shared amongst competing companies. For instructions and more information regarding proprietary information please refer to section IV of this document.  <br>  B.	Participation in the Blast Mitigating Seat Market Survey provides an important opportunity to influence the solicitation provisions, contract clauses, budget requests, and a full range of other elements that support the acquisition strategy for this Blast Mitigating Seat project. The U.S. Army will not provide compensation for any resources spent on this Market Survey and participation is at the discretion of the seat manufacturer/developer.  <br>    <br>  II.	Instructions  <br>  A.	Read the Capability Summary for Blast Mitigating Seats in Section III of this Market Survey.    <br>  B.	Answer all questions in the Market Survey. If certain blast mitigating seat capabilities shown in the survey are deemed not available or may not be achievable by the respondent's company, please include alternate proposals that may meet the intent of the capability as described.  <br>  C.	Provide product brochures or other forms of information that is relevant to this Market Survey as deemed appropriate. Additionally, it is encouraged to provide any additional information that enables the Interior Blast Mitigation Team to have insight into the company and product performance.  <br>  D.	There are eighteen (18) sections in this document requesting information. The sections are as follows: Company Information, Company Capabilities, General Blast Mitigating Seat Requirements, Specific Blast Mitigating Seat Requirements (Listed A-N), and General Blast Mitigating Seat Information. Please answer each section as described above. Each section has specific applications and the information provided will help us determine how the seat will integrate in that application.  <br>    <br>  III.	Capability Summary for Blast Mitigating Seats  <br>  The Occupant Centric Platform (OCP) program is a top priority program for which the US Army seeks to build a demonstrator vehicle by identifying the needs of the occupant and developing a vehicle around the occupant. This is contrary to previous designs which builds a vehicle first with occupant needs second. The purpose of the OCP program is to address the needs, comfort, and space claim of the occupants as well as mitigating injury during underbody blast, crash and rollover events during the continuously evolving threats against military vehicles. The Government currently leads a program to address the OCP philosophy called the Occupant Centric Platform - Technology-Enabled Capability Demonstrator (OCP - TECD) that will require quick turnaround on occupant protection designs, modeling and simulation, testing and prototypes.  A major component of the OCP program is the development of seats that enhances the protection of the occupant. These seats shall reduce the amount of energy transferred to the occupant during a blast through any appropriate Energy Absorbing (EA) method.  <br>    <br>  IV.

The initial vertical loading, simulating underbody blast, shall be characterized by a Delta-V greater than or equal to 12.0   0.5 m/s within 5.0   1.0 ms and slam down shall be characterized by 25% of the initial load characterization for 3.0   1.0 m/s. Injury sustainment and severity values obtained from ATDs, 5th percentile female (110 pounds) to the 95th percentile male (230 pounds) fully burdened with gear (up to additional 65 pounds), used in testing, shall be used to determine the effectiveness of the EA method. Provide the calculations showing how your change in velocity is determined, any analysis to support EA method performance, and any certification standards that you currently meet.	 	   <br>  2		All materials used in the blast mitigating seat design shall withstand chemical and environment exposures to include: storage temperature ranges of (-40) degrees Fahrenheit to (160) degrees Fahrenheit; 95% humidity level; low pressure tests to simulate military aircraft transportation; exposure such as salt, fog, sand, dust and fungus; vehicle vibrations; and solar radiation exposure IAW the latest released version of MIL-STD-810.	 	   <br>  3		The blast mitigating seat with all components and its interfaces (the seat back may be upright or folded flat) shall withstand static loading up to (690) pounds. If not, what is your current static load limit?	 	   <br>  4		The materials used to develop the blast mitigating seats and if applicable, any mechanisms that allow the seat to move or adjust, shall be able to function and withstand the military environment throughout its entire lifespan not including a blast, crash, or rollover event. Lifespan is defined as ten (10) years. What is your current blast mitigating seat designated lifespan?	 	   <br>  5		The materials used to develop the blast mitigating seats and if applicable, any mechanisms that allows the seat to move or adjust, shall be able to undergo routine cleaning approximately once a month with detergents and water, during a spray hose wash.  Immersion in the latest version of MIL-STD-810 shall be met.	 	   <br>  6		All electrical components, if applicable, shall have a fail-safe mode in the case of an electrical outage or vehicle/component water immersion while in operation.

The minimum acceptable range shall be the following: forward one and a half (1.5) inches, lateral half (0.5) inch, vertical downward five and a half (5.5) inches and vertical upward zero (0) inches.	 	   <br>  8		The blast mitigating seats shall withstand the initial blast event and the resulting slam down event simulated on a drop tower. The initial criteria for the drop tower will be a  vertical loading characterized by a Delta-V greater than or equal to 12.0   0.5 m/s within 5.0   1.0 m/. Slam down will be characterized by 25% of the initial load characterization for 3.0   1.0 m/s. (Provide the calculations showing how your change in velocity is determined.)	 	   <br>  9	 	The blast mitigating seat shall be analyzed to determine the effects of shocks and repetitive or dynamic loading on the seat to determine if any performance characteristics are diminished. To simulate the abuse the seat will be subjected to during normal driving operations, the seat shall be tested to the following criteria: a fully burdened 95th percentile male with a repetitive load being applied to the seat resulting in a maximum of six (6) watts occupant average absorbed power during 25,000 hours of total simulation. Provide any data to support previous testing.	 	   <br>  10		The blast mitigating seat design shall be analyzed for vehicle rollover and vehicle crash (front, side, and rear impact) events using finite element modeling and simulation. 5th% female (with and without gear) and 50th% male and 95th% male (with gear) ATDs will be used to determine injury types and severity. (The ATD gear data can be provided as required.)	 	   <br>  11		The blast mitigating seat shall dissipate all of the heat being generated during normal operation to keep the occupant from getting injured and to keep performance characteristics from being diminished. Assume the following worst case scenario: (160) degree Fahrenheit ambient temperature; zero humidity; ten (10) hour duty cycle; and six (6) watt average absorbed power into mechanism caused by vehicle motion. Provide any data to support previous testing.	 	   <br>  12	  	Have the blast mitigating seats shown proof of execution for off axis blast greater than or equal to 15 degrees about the seats X, Y, and Z -Axis while meeting survivability criteria?

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command , Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA, has a requirement in support of PM-Force Sustainment Systems for the Advanced Low Velocity Airdrop System Light and Heavy (ALVADS-L/H).  The intent of the ALVADS-L/H program is to identify a new parachute which will replace the G-11 cargo parachute and will ensure load survivability at lower altitudes while being more cost effective than the G-11 over its lifecycle.  The Advanced Low Velocity Airdrop System's (ALVADS) is a suite of options when distribution of supplies and equipment is required by aerial delivery.  ALVADS consists of five components:  Component I - ALVADS Extraction Parachute Jettison System (EPJS), Component II - ALVADS Light, Component III - ALVADS Heavy, Component IV - ALVADS Advanced Cargo Parachute Release System (ACPRS), and Component V - ALVADS Rapid Rigging and De-rigging Airdrop System (RRDAS).  Component I ALVADS EPJS has already achieved a MS C Decision and has been initially fielded.  Component IV ALVADS ACPRS is currently pursuing a MS C, Type Classification and Full Materiel Release Decision.  Based on the US Army Combined Arms Support Command (CASCOM) priorities list for ALVADS and the recent decision to combine the Light and Heavy requirements, ALVADS Light/Heavy capability is the next priority.  The Government anticipates awarding several Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the base effort with a down select to one for the remaining portion of the contract.  Funds will be obligated for quantities ordered upon issuance of delivery orders and not by the basic contract.  The contract guaranteed minimum is $80,000.00.  The contract maximum shall not exceed $15,000,000.00.  Market Research has been conducted by technical experts, and has shown that this requirement will be procured under Full and Open Competition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 314999.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code is 2399 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. Anticipated RFP Release on the Natick Contracting Division's website https://www3.natick.army.mil will be on or about December 2013.  Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Hortense M. Mageroswski,Contract Specialist, via e-mail at Hortense M. Mageroswski @ hortense.m.magerowski.civ@mail.mil

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of this notice is to advertise the opportunity to LEASE the LaGarde Building and some surrounding area in the new Zone A Development Area on the Washington,  DC Campus of the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH). This 214,000 square foot building located, just minutes from the Capital, at 3700 North Capital Street, NW, was built in 1992 as a Senior HealthCare Facility.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The surrounding campus and area offer a fair amount of amenities. The open historic campus is secured by a perimeter fence and a security controlled gate. Large parking lots are located on campus that can accommodate motorist. Three city bus route stops are located at the main gate to the campus and the metro is within 1200 yards (less than 3/4 of a mile). Within a mile and half of the LaGarde &nbsp;Building, approximately 250,000 square feet of retail space and 1500 residential units are being built or started within the next three years. In the future, this building will be within the boundaries of the 77 acre development that includes over 4 million square feet of retail, office space, and residential. The attachments provide more details related to the building and surrounding area.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Any interested party in the lease of the LaGarde  Building shall be allowed to renovate/modify the facility and surrounding area within the guidelines and restrictions of the historic and applicable building code requirements along with any pertinent federal regulations and AFRH policies. All interested parties may contact AFRH for tours and any information or data that is available and that the perspective deems useful.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By the response deadline, all interested parties shall propose their concept for usage, renovation and occupancy timelines, and approximate rental fee structure and amounts that will be paid to AFRH. After the response deadline, AFRH will narrow the list down to 2 or more plausible and compatible concepts that fit best with AFRHs needs and campus. After AFRH has narrowed down the list, the remaining interested parties will be interviewed. After the interview or interviews, AFRH will narrow the list to one interested party. That party will be put in contact with the Corp. of Engineers (the leasing agent and property managers for AFRH) for negotiations and lease award.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">AFRH encourages the interested parties to be creative. We are open to all ideas and rental fee concepts. We understand that the LaGarde Building will require modifications and alterations to be usable, and we are willing and expecting to allow the developer to defer rental payments to offset cost to make the LaGarde Building and surrounding area a usable product that can be profitable (this deferred payment concept is also known as &ldquo;in-kind consideration&rdquo; as described in the AFRH Legislation U.S.C. Title 24, Chapter 10, Subchapter I, Section 411 (i))</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">AFRH is an independent government agency with the authority to lease real property to generate revenue for its trust fund. The United States Congress established the Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) as a separate federal agency in 1991 when it enacted the Defense Authorization Act, Public Law 101-510.&nbsp; AFRH is the only Federal Agency that does not receive tax payer funds for every day operation. The Agency&rsquo;s source of income flows from the enlisted men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States through a small payroll deduction and forfeitures. In addition to the contributions from enlisted personnel, AFRH enjoys donations from generous individuals and the interest income from a trust fund established in 1855 for the Forefather to AFRH, the United States Soldiers Home.&nbsp; While the total number of residents varies from month-to-month, AFRH provides a home for approximately 600 former enlisted personnel in their retirement years at both the Gulfport and Washington campuses. This Home provides retired veterans with the common daily living needs such as: private rooms, bank, chapel, convenience store, mail room, laundry facilities, barber/beauty shop, dining facility, and a 24-hour security and staff presence. In addition to these common needs, AFRH offers social, recreational, and occupational activities for many interests. While residents live in this community, AFRH provides for their overall health care needs in a high quality manner; including on site primary care, medical care, and a continuum of long-term care services as residents transition from independent living. Our residents found it to be an honor to serve our country. AFRH finds it to be an honor to serve them now.</p>

Contractors are strictly prohibited from discussing this requirement with any member of the identified program office.
