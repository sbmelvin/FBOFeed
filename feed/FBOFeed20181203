<p>The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data needed to manufacture this item. Firms interested in participating in this procurement are encouraged to contact the OEM, Hamilton-Sundstrand CAGE 73030 to inquire about the data or rights to the data.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.</p>
<p>It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<br />Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.</p>
<p>20. Buyer name, phone#, and email address Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer Christopher J. Cook, 405-739-4478, christopher.cook.62@us.af.mil</p>

<a href="mailto:james.leal@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (PEO C4I), and Program Management, Warfare (PMW) Information Assurance and Cyber Security Program Office (PMW 130) intends to award a sole-source single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems (LMRMS) located at 12999 Deer Creek Canyon Rd, Littleton, CO 80127 for its General Service (GENSER) Cross Domain Solution (CDS), Radiant Mercury (RADMERC).  This sole-source IDIQ contract will be a follow-on to the current contract with LMRMS.
Under this procurement, LMRMS will continue to provide the Navy with the only CDS, RADMERC, that currently has the capabilities that meet the Navy's, NSA's, and other customers' baseline software requirements and is able to meet the continuing delivery and sustainment requirements at all security levels.  Additionally, RADMERC is composed of baseline software that is reliant on LMRMS' proprietary MAG software code, which is required to make RADMERC fully functional, and only LMRMS has the Intellectual Property (IP) rights to use the MAG software.
The resultant contract will provide for the support of Navy and other Agencies' RADMERC operations to ensure the capability to securely transfer data across different security domains. The scope of work is for installation, program management, maintenance, modernization, and sustainment of RADMERC systems and will provide system security authorization support, and logistics and training services. The work scope will also sustain existing National Cross Domain Strategic Management Office (NCDSMO) approved baselines, ensuring that the RADMERC CDS sanitizes, guards, and downgrades classified data from designated communications channels, and verifies that the data meets a set of rigorously controlled criteria.
This sole-source contract action will substantially reduce the risk of unacceptable delays or duplication of costs associated with modifying any other existing CDSs and attaining the required National Security Agency (NSA) and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) certifications.
The anticipated Period of Performance (PoP) will be from 01 September 2019 to 31 August 2029. The resultant contract will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) with a five-year base and one five-year option. Be advised that the aforementioned information is anticipatory in nature and is not binding.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 541512.
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS OR A SOLICITATION OF OFFERORS. A solicitation will not be posted. Any responsible sources may submit a capability statement that demonstrates that they can satisfy the Government's requirement which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government to not compete the anticipated contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Efforts described above should be submitted no later than (15) calendar days from the date of this synopsis to Ms. Cindy Ledesma, Contracting Officer, at cindy.ledesma@navy.mil and Mr. James Leal, Contract Specialist, at james.leal@navy.mil. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted.

<DESC>This project is advertised on an unrestricted basis utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection Procedures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 236220. The estimated completion time will be 540 days. The estimated cost range is from 1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00. The solicitation is schedule to be posted around 10 January 2019.
<p>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers has a need for construction of a reinforced concrete wall at three locations immediately downstream of the Unit 4 intake bulkhead at West Point Power House, West Point, Georgia. Each wall is 12'-6" thick, 17' long, and 33' tall. The wall will be tied to the existing powerhouse structure with steel dowels and two water-stops will be installed to insure water tightness. During construction the temperature of the concrete at the time of placement will not be able to exceed 70 degrees (mass concrete pour). Additional challenges include the physical location of these walls and the limited access for construction materials. Two water leaks in the existing west intake concrete bulkhead joint will require piping to discharge the water. The rate of leakage is calculated to be approximately 70 to 90 gallons per minute. No debris of any kind will be allowed to be disposed of in the draft tubes during construction. In order to access Unit 4 intake and redefine the workspace from confined to open, the contractor must remove two pre-stressed double tees that are roughly 8 feet wide by 40 feet long. The contractor shall be responsible for removing the double tees and the construction and subsequent removal of a temporary secondary means of egress. The existing overhead crane in the powerhouse will be available to move construction materials in and out of the Unit 4 cavity. The crane will be operated by government personnel. The contractor shall coordinate the need for the crane and associated logistics with the powerhouse supervisor at least two days prior to the need. Any powerhouse project or maintenance activity requiring the crane takes precedence over the contractor's use of the crane and cannot be used as the basis of a claim. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract will be awarded based on FAR Part 15 "best value" procedures.</p>

The contract will specify discharge ring template requirements to verify the profile matches the design profile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Epoxy injection will also be required. The overlay of the stainless steel will inevitably have resulting voids that must be filled with epoxy. Work includes drilling and washing the epoxy injection holes and air relief holes; making epoxy-injection connections; furnishing, transporting, mixing, and injection of the epoxy; patching the finished epoxy injection holes; clean-up of the draft tube lining; and such other incidental operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. <strong>Cavitation repair of hub and blades</strong> - Spot repairs will be completed on the turbine hub and blades. The turbine hub and blades were manufactured from plain carbon steel. For the hub and blade cavitation repairs, the weld material will be mild steel except for the outermost portion of the repair (approximately &frac14; inch thickness), which will be comprised of a stainless steel overlay. The stainless steel overlay surface will be ground and machined to the finished profile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. <strong>Sandblast and painting of unit discharge ring, blades, and hub</strong> - After all the repairs are completed, the turbine runner, hub, and blades will be sandblasted and painted. For this work, a detailed paint specification section will be completed, utilizing the USACE vinyl paint system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">d. <strong>Blade inspections</strong> - NDE of the blades to determine the presence of fatigue cracks, particularly near the turbine connections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">e. <strong>Draft tube/turbine maintenance platform</strong> - Complete all work necessary to certify the existing maintenance platform IAW EM 385-1-1. Work will likely include the contractor to take a sample of the existing steel and analyze its contents, remove and re-weld the platform's lugs, perform a NDT of welds, and perform a load test on the platform for certification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Contractor will be required to commence work upon receipt of contract award and <strong>complete the work 1052 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed</strong>. Work will be performed as single unit outages between mid-November to mid-May of three (3) consecutive years, beginning in Nov 2019 and ending May 2022.

Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:  : 
VA funded Research requires a GE AKTA pure 25 L protein and other biomolecule purification system.  This instrument will best suit the needs of the research projects it is being procured for.  The only other FPLC on the market is sold by Knauer, a German company.  It is called the Azura Bio Sec system.  The requested FPLC, the AKTA pure made by GE Healthcare (USA-based), has a broader range of flow rates over which it can operate and also a higher maximum operating pressure than the Azura system.  Most importantly, the AKTA FPLC and accompanying GE Healthcare columns (Superose Increase 6 and Superdex Increase 200 columns) have been used successfully by other investigators to carry out the type of protein purification required by the VA for the research project funding this procurement.  Specific conditions optimal for fractionating serum into lipoprotein components and isolating smaller molecular weight amyloid proteins using GE Healthcare products are available in published scientific literature. 


Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted: 
VIP was queried for NAICS 334516 and 85 SDVOSB/VOSB concerns were returned.  A Query of VIP for NAICS 334516 and key words GE ATKA Pere 25L and 79 SDVOSB/VOSB concerns were returned.  Customer market research also revealed that there are 2 or more SDVOSB entities that could provide this system and the required accessories.

<DESC>&nbsp;RFI / SOURCES SOUGHT Synopsis: 1. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information purposes only and neither constitutes a solicitation nor a commitment by the government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be compensated. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information in this RFI. Your response will be treated as information only, it shall not be used as a proposal. 2. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Cycle, Special Operations Forces and Personnel Recovery Division (AFLCMC/WIS) is requesting information to identify potential sources that may possess the technical data, expertise, capabilities, and experience to support the Air Force Special Operation Command requirement to improve GPS Hardening capabilities onboard the MC-130J and EC-130J aircraft. 3. The MC/EC-130J aircraft require an upgraded GPS capability to meet the FY 2011 National Defense Authorization Act mandated Military Code (M-Code) compliance. Due to the non-availability of M-Code hardware until after the CY21 timeframe, the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) requires an interim upgraded system to improve GPS performance in a GPS degraded/denied threat environment. This GPS Hardening Anti-Jamming solution is intended to mitigate and offset these threats until the mandated M-Code solution becomes available. 4. For the interim solution, the USG is pursuing the acquisition of two digital GPS hardening technologies to replace the existing GAS-1 Antenna Electronics with digital nulling (i.e., ability of antenna to remove threat signals from GPS interference) and digital beam steering (i.e., ability to improve extra gain toward GPS satellite). Integrating these improved GPS nulling and beam steering capabilities onboard the MC/EC-130J aircraft will require procuring the Digital Antenna Electronics (DAE) equipment, upgrading the GPS receiver and making the software updates or upgrades to the Dash (-) 5 Embedded GPS/Inertial Navigation System (EGI) without incurring research and development costs. 5. The contractor will be required to provide information that they can demonstrate experience in the capabilities listed below to satisfy this improved GPS hardening requirement. The anticipated scope will include providing services, engineering, testing and manufacturing. The USG requests the contractor to respond to their ability to satisfy the following requirements (not all inclusive). a) The proposed Digital Antenna Electronics (DAE) system must meet the following system requirements: 1. ICD-TNL-DAE Interface Control Document for the Digital Antenna Electronics (DAE), revision A, 23 June 2008, Trimble Military and Advanced Systems, Inc 2. ICD-TNL-167 Interface Control Document for the GPS Receiver Application Module Modified Standard Electronics Module (GRAM-S). Revision 1.16, 21 October 2009, Trimble Military and Advanced Systems, Inc 3. DAE tuned to work with the electrical signals matching those provided by the controlled radiation pattern antenna (CRPA). The CRPA is a 7 element that connects to specified port on the DAE 4. DAE capable of carrying the digital beam data from the GPS Receiver, Trimble 524D, as described in the ICD-TNL-DAE. 5. DAE coordinates the digital beam steering with the Trimble GPS Receiver that is part of the Honeywell H-764 Advanced Configurable EGI (ACE). 6. The Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) is a Form Fit as a replacement to the Raytheon GAS-1 Antenna Electronics unit that accepts seven RF signal inputs from the CRPA. 7. Requires the following outputs: i. RF cable output from the DAE for digital beam data ii. RS-422 Control for high speed digitized IF data link iii. Two Additional protected RF outputs for Legacy GPS receivers iv. Power v. Test/Status b) Explain and outline the contractor digital GPS hardening (nulling and beam steering) system. c) Is the designated hardening solution fielded, development, or in production? d) Fielded on military aircraft or COTs? e) Ability of the contractor to meet the pre-manufacturing "Need Date" of 1 July 2019. This date derived from the requirement to perform cyber security and airworthiness assessments before DAE manufacturing plus notifying the EGI vendor of the DAE solution. f) Solution applies only to the front end of the aircraft, not the backend mission. g) Will testing be required? If so, what type? h) Estimated schedule i) Any research, development prototyping required? j) Quality assurance/inspections/certifications k) Engineering and technical support 1. Non-recurring engineering design 2. Reverse engineering 3. Engineering support services 4. Technical documents 5. Technical Orders 6. Engineering analysis 7. CAD/CAM drawings l) Aircraft modification/installation; i.e., ability to produce a trial kit install unit (TKI) and production kit install (PKI) units m) Developing training and training materials n) Generation and interpretation of data and drawings o) Kit fabrication and build p) Program management q) Ability to perform manufacturing work at contractor location r) Performing aircraft field installations at other CONUS locations s) Ability to obtain Secret clearances 6. If after reviewing this information your company desires to participate by responding to this notice, provide documentation that supports your company&rsquo;s ability to support this improved GPS-H Hardening requirement. Failure to provide adequate documentation will inhibit the government&rsquo;s assessment of your capabilities. If your company lacks sufficient capability, please provide details explaining how the company would overcome the shortfall in order to perform. The information gathered by this RFI may be utilized to plan for a follow-on contract. Joint ventures or teaming arrangement are permissible. 7. Please provide the following business information for your company, institution, or any teaming or joint venture partners: company name; address; point of contact; CAGE code; telephone number; email address; web page URL; size of business pursuant to the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 334220; based on the above NAICS code, state whether your company is a Large Business, Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Economically-Disadvantaged Woman-Owned Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) Certified, HUBZone Certified, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, and Central Contractor Registration. Also include a statement indicating whether the company is domestically or foreign owned. If foreign owned, please indicate the country of ownership. Finally, interested parties should submit information regarding possible subcontracting opportunities, type of supplies/services offered (i.e., commercial and/or non-commercial), and examples of contracts held for similar efforts, including contract number and contracting point of contact. 8. General capabilities and experience with the scope of efforts listed in para 5 should be submitted on CD-R or DVD-R in an electronic format that is compatible with Microsoft Windows and Office 2016. Send this CD/DVD to Mr. John Lindsay, AFLCMC/WISK 1895 5th Street, Bldg. 46, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7200 not later than 4:00 PM EST, 14 December 2018.

<p>Army Contracting Command-Orlando is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify potential sources having an interest and industry technologies available to consolidate the integration and development of the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) platform.</p>
<p>The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement, if a requirement materializes. Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition. All small business set-aside categories will be considered. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding submissions.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) TO BE SUBMITTED. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) is a capability providing the Department of Defense (DOD) cyberspace workforce the ability to conduct cyberspace operations training (including exercises and mission rehearsals), experimentation, certification, as well as the assessment and development of cyber capabilities and tactics, techniques, and procedures for missions that cross boundaries and networks. PCTE provides the capability required to train forces operating in cyberspace in accordance with congressional and DOD mandates.</p>
<p>PCTE's ultimate solution will be a cloud-based training platform to support Cyber workforce with individual through force level sustainment training, team certification, and provide the foundations for a collective training network (i.e. Cyber Flag, Cyber Guard). It will leverage existing architecture and capability, including existing Service tools connected to the various cyber ranges, in order to provide the emulated environments for virtual cyber training. The materiel development activities for PCTE include integrating hardware and software into a training platform that orchestrates event planning, training resources, and after action review into a cohesive and networked training event.</p>
<p>The PCTE platform, in its desired end state, will use integrated virtual machines connecting Cyber Training and Test Ranges. As part of the Cyber Range cloud-based environment, PCTE will have the ability to share resources, such as scenarios and content, and providing additional "maneuver space" such as emulated Red (adversarial), Blue (friendly), Grey (neutral), and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments. It will connect to six geographically disperse Cyber workforce locations and allow individual units to access capabilities and participate in distributed training (called Connectivity). PCTE is not a cyber range; it is every aspect of training exercise means and training systems that would take place in a range.</p>
<p>The PCTE program continually deploys prototype capabilities through competitive Cyber Innovation Challenges (CICs) to the field to include such capabilities as event management, environment creation/replication, and connections into to the Services' Crew Training Facilities. With continued evaluation of the CIC prototypes by Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) personnel, the PCTE platform will evolve based on changes in technology, threat, and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These changes will require software developed by contractors, external vendors, and other Government organizations to be holistically incorporated into the existing platform for rapid delivery.</p>
<p>Product Manager (PdM) Cyber Resiliency and Training (CRT) is currently integrating vendor solutions into the modular PCTE baseline that includes a number of commercial and proprietary products. Integration requires technical data exchange, specifications, and coordination with other contractors to ensure compatibility and selection the best-of-breed cyberspace operations training platform. It is expected the P-CIDC contract will require the integration of software delivered under the CICs to meet identified gaps and integrate new capabilities.</p>
<p>As part of the lifecycle sustainment of PCTE, the PdM CRT has a requirement for a contracting vehicle to continue development operations with the integration of software and hardware enhancements delivered on other contracts as technology insertion occurs while conducting testing, providing periodic system updates, and fielding technology upgrades of PCTE to CMF. In addition, the contract will provide a limited operations and maintenance support for PCTE to ensure high system availability throughout the acquisition life cycle. The contract will be dynamic and agile to support a highly complex joint program operating in a number of classifications at geographically disparate sites requiring 24/7 on-demand accessibility.</p>
<p>The P-CIDC has the underlying need to ensure standardization, synchronization, and management while maximizing reuse, commonality and high system availability while maintaining the systems cyber security posture. The contract must provide for a dynamic mechanisms for multiphase configuration management, development and support, integration and sustainment labs, and technology insertion and growth.</p>
<p>The purpose of the P-CIDC contract is to support the business goals of the PCTE program. These goals include:</p>
<p>&bull; Decreasing time to produce and present training scenarios<br />&bull; Increasing training throughput<br />&bull; Increasing quality of training<br />&bull; Increasing the reuse of training scenarios/emulated environments</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES<br />The Government requires the development and integration of software, hardware and associated levels of testing to support release of PCTE material solution to satisfy current and future PCTE requirements. In this the Government seeks the contractor to deliver a fully integrated training platform involving software and hardware contributions from various sources for integration, to include performing testing prior to fielding the software. This will require such activities that include software development, system integration, test and system delivery and upgrades to ensure compliance with contract requirements and timely delivery of required products. It is expected the system development, integration and release of the PCTE platform will occur with direct Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) user-centric feedback integrated and driving agile six month capability releases.</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor will provide a real time web-based reporting mechanism to collect, store and analyze operations, maintenance, supply, and inventory data of all the sites. This reporting system will provide Government access for the purposes of operations and logistics reviews. A customer call in center will be required providing twenty-four hours per day seven days a week toll-free call-in support services. The contract efforts are to include repairs and replacement stocks for maintaining required Operational Availability (Ao) of 95%; it will include updates to logistic documentation such as provisioning data, tech manuals and drawings, and provide integration instruction and field support for SW and HW upgrades at customer locations. This effort will encompass logistics support and sustainment of Regional Compute and Storage (RCS) nodes over seven locations CONUS and OCONUS.</p>

<p>These requirements are being procured through TTI, as they are the only proven responsible source that can satisfy Agency requirements. TTI has been under contract with NASA since 1993 (ISS Program inception) as a prime contractor or major subcontractor providing the Russian language and logistics services to the ISS Program and is the only contractor that has provided these services for the ISS Program. TTI was instrumental in setting up the infrastructure currently used by NASA in Russia. They have obtained the required approvals and licenses to operate in Russia and have established, long-term working relationships with the IP and with other businesses/organizations in Russia that are crucial to smooth and efficient operations in Russia (customs, shipping, transportation entities, housing entities, etc.). Additionally, TTI has an in-depth, comprehensive understanding of the inherent safety challenges with performing language and logistics services in Russia and Kazakhstan, including driving in hazardous conditions and managing and transporting up to one hundred visitors traveling simultaneously to Russia/Kazakhstan to support each Soyuz launch. <br /><br />TTI has obtained and maintained "Foreign Company Accreditation" required by Russian Federation law to do business in the country and meets all requirements for U.S. Department of State approvals and clearance. TTI interpreters, translators and language trainers have a high-level of skill and in-depth understanding on all aspects of the ISS Program, including cultural and programmatic sensitivities, required to assist key ISS Program and NASA personnel in communications with Russian organizations and personnel. TTI interpreters working in the Mission Control Centers (Houston and Moscow) have passed stringent certification requirements, which nominally requires a minimum of two years to complete. Additionally, TTI personnel are proficient in the ISS Program acronyms, specialized technical language and terms, and ISS Lexicon and ISS Operations Nomenclature required to provide consistent use of terminology in all language products.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for December is December 1, 2018 to December 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2019 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 19-REG10 and must be located within Region 10.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 17 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2018, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2019 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY19 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.<br /> <br /> <br /></p>

<DESC><strong>Louisville District Corps of Engineers Soliciting Comments on the Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) at Scott Air Force Base, IL.</strong>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Corps of Engineers Louisville District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for multiple projects consisting of the renovation of multi-story administrative facilities, schools, or hospitals that include interior and exterior renovation.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)</strong> Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)</strong> Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement and Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p><br /><strong>1)</strong> Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would affect the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> Identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>Please provide your comments via e-mail to Kelly.B.Maxwell@usace.army.mil no later than 1:00 PM EST on 14 December 2018.</p>

13. Description of work: 

The Advanced Research Projects Agency  Energy ("ARPA-E" or "Agency") is a separately organized agency within the Department of Energy ("DOE").  The mission of ARPA-E is to overcome the long-term and high-risk barriers in the development of energy technologies.  ARPA-E facilitates, creates, manages and catalyzes accelerated transformational energy research and development ("R&D") programs and projects to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that reduce energy imports, improve energy efficiency and reduce energy-related emissions.  The goals of ARPA-E, as established by the America Competes Act of 2007, are generally to: (1) enhance American economic security by identifying technologies with the potential to reduce energy imports from foreign sources; (2) reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and improve efficiency across the energy spectrum; and (3) ensure the United States of America remains a technological leader in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.

ARPA-E's mission is highly dependent on intellectual property matters, including acquiring necessary intellectual property rights for government purposes, supporting commercialization of technologies resulting from ARPA-E awards, ensuring US manufacturing requirements, and defending government intellectual property rights in disputes and litigation.  

In providing intellectual property services, the Contractor will apply its expertise and experience as follows under collaborative guidance and monitoring of the ARPA-E Chief Counsel ("Chief Counsel") and the office of the DOE Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property ("DOE Assistant General Counsel"): 

a. The Contractor will support the Chief Counsel and the DOE Assistant General Counsel to identify, assess, and resolve complex intellectual property issues. The Contractor will advise on intellectual property matters and provide senior experience to support ARPA-E Funding Opportunity Announcements and resulting award negotiations; address complicated technology commercialization issues, and any necessary ARPA-E policy changes. The Contractor will draft documents and provide other assistance to ARPA-E in the field of Intellectual Property, including the crafting of ARPA-E policies, standard contract clauses, preparing presentations, and participating in meetings with staff at ARPA-E.  

b. At the discretion of Chief Counsel, the Contractor may be asked to review and provide recommendations, such as special intellectual property provisions with respect to proposed new solicitations and sole source awards.  

c. At the direction of the DOE Assistant General Counsel, the Contractor will mentor less experienced intellectual property attorneys in the office of the DOE Assistant General Counsel who support ARPA-E.

d. In accordance with relevant ARPA-E policies and procedures, and using material approved by ARPA-E, the Contractor will provide awardees who have been selected to receive awards from ARPA-E with proposed Intellectual Property terms and conditions. The Contractor will interact with proposed awardees with regard to their intellectual property concerns.

e. The Contractor will assist the Chief Counsel and the DOE Assistant General Counsel, and their legal staffs, as they provide legal advice to ARPA-E legal and the ARPA-E contracting staff of awardee concerns with respect to those proposed provisions.  

f. During the term of ARPA-E awards, the Contractor will assist ARPA-E legal and contracting and the DOE Assistant General Counsel in the administration of ARPA-E awards.  This may include facilitating the reporting of inventions, the submission of periodic and final technical reports and the close out of awards.  It may also include assisting the Chief Counsel and the DOE Assistant General Counsel, in the review and comment on Intellectual Property and Data Management Plans and Subject Invention Utilization reports. 

g. The Contractor will also monitor developments in the field of intellectual property law with particular attention to developments related to the activities of the Federal Government such as the awarding of agreements for the performance of research and development.  The Contractor will work directly with the DOE Assistant General Counsel to keep informed on current DOE policies and procedures with respect to intellectual property, such as the awarding and administration of agreements, reporting of awardee inventions, government employee inventions, maintenance of award and invention records, disposition of intellectual property rights, and the treatment of infringement claims. The Contractor will keep the Chief Counsel apprised of such developments that affect ARPA-E.  

h. At the request of the Chief Counsel or the DOE Assistant General Counsel, the Contractor will assess, and recommend strategies to respond to unusual intellectual property situations.

i. The Contractor will perform other services related to intellectual property as requested by the Chief Counsel or the DOE Assistant General Counsel.

This procurement will provide the MarketScan Database to the DOC, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Office of the Chief Economist so that users can obtain medical claims-level data for the ten-year period beginning in 1998, in sufficient detail for their research needs. Understanding the changing role of health care in the U.S. economy and its impact on economic growth is critical to addressing many of the important policy issues being raised regarding health care. Improving the available data is an obvious first step in that direction. Data for spending by disease, along with BEA&rsquo;s proposed disease-level price indexes, will help provide a much clearer picture of the drivers of medical care costs increases. Improvements to the deflator for medical care will provide a better measure for how much of the rising cost of health care may be attributed to price increases versus growth in real services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the gross domestic product accounts currently include a complete accounting for health care, but the health-related components are in different sections of the health data to present a comprehensive picture of the health sector that is consistent with BEA&rsquo;s existing accounts.

<SOLNBR>DOIGFBO190005
<CONTACT>Lewandowski, Gerald
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, United States Geological Survey, Sacramento Acquisition Branch, plans to contract by means other than full and open competition. The United States Geological Survey intends to make a non-competitive firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Nanometrics, Inc., located in Ottawa Canada for seismic equipment described in the attached salient characteristics.
 
Background
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement to purchase earthquake and volcano monitoring systems, including integrated systems (containing both sensors and data acquisition units (DAUs)) and systems comprised of separate DAUs and sensors (either strong motion sensors or broadband sensors).  This equipment will be used in the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS), the Global Seismographic Network (GSN), and the USGS Volcano Program to serve the needs of earthquake and volcano monitoring, engineering, and research communities as well as national, state, and local governments, emergency response organizations, and the public.  Applications of these devices may include urban and rural free-field and reference sites, and other types of networks, such as volcano monitoring and broadband networks.

Specifications
Note: The systems must be existing, upgraded, or improved versions of models which can be purchased off-the-shelf and of a type or types that have been utilized in previous deployments for periods of not less than six (6) months. 
The required instrumentation systems consist of three components: (1) a triaxial force-balance accelerometer, triaxial strong-motion velocity seismometer, or triaxial broadband seismometer (the sensor); (2) a DAU, and (3) software for communicating with deployed units.  When the DAU and sensor are integrated into a single package, the system is called a DAS (Data Acquisition System).  These specifications are organized by sensor, DAU, environmental and packaging issues that apply to both sensors and DAUs, software, and additional requirements.  The scope of this action includes the requirement to provide all of the instrumentation components which includes but may not be limited to cables, connectors, related accessories and ancillary equipment.  Software must be included with all DAUs and DASs if required for data acquisition.
Additional information and specifications can be found in the following attachments. 

Spreadsheet Titled Tables 1-4 Specifications 2019
Word Document  Titled Additional Information 

The equipment specifications required to obtain the necessary data, consistency and compatibility with the existing infrastructure can only be provided by Nanometrics Inc. 

Award will be made in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 and the procedures at FAR Part 12 entitled, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15 entitled, Contracting by Negotiation. Nanometrics Inc. is the only known source that is capable of meeting the governments minimum requirements.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina <br />9.	JOB DESCRIPTION:  See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT <br />The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is responsible for development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of justice sector capacity-building programs for the U.S. Department of State.  INL programs in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) focus on reforming the criminal justice system in accordance with Euro-Atlantic standards through a sustained, multi-year effort.  INL has assisted the Government of BiH to reduce the backlog of war crimes cases; provide victim witness support; develop a track record of convictions against organized and transnational crime, corruption, and terrorism; enhance global and regional security; and improve law enforcement capacity to protect and serve the public.  INL will continue to provide such assistance and will also target opportunities to strengthen the capacity of civil society in counter-corruption practices and improve public trust in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>The Senior Justice Advisor (SJA) will lead rule of law programmatic efforts with the BiH State Prosecutor's Office (SPO).  The selected SJA will develop and implement programs to strengthen prosecutorial and judicial institutions throughout BiH (including the SPO, and entity, cantonal, and municipal prosecutorial and judicial institutions) in new, innovative, and sustainable ways.  The SJA will work with - yet independently of - the Resident Legal Advisor (RLA) from the Office of the Overseas Prosecutorial Development Assistance and Training (OPDAT).  Under Chief of Mission authority and INL Sarajevo supervision, the SJA will coordinate with INL's Office of Europe and Asia programs (INL/EA) to ensure efficient program management, to report host country developments impacting assistance programs, and to stay abreast of significant developments outside of BiH and the region that directly and indirectly affect U.S. government criminal justice and rule of law programs.</p>
<p>The SJA will track and analyze the impact of INL-provided assistance and will coordinate with other key stakeholders, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union (EU) mission to BiH, the United Nations mission to BiH, and other governmental and non-governmental donors as appropriate to prevent duplication and increase efficiencies.</p>
<p>Duties/ Responsibilities<br />1.	Maintain programmatic lead on all INL rule of law advising, training, and mentoring efforts at the SPO in coordination with the OPDAT RLA, other relevant Embassy sections, and international partners, as appropriate.<br />2.	Identify organizational and other impediments to effective prosecutions within the SPO and other prosecutorial and judicial offices, and work with relevant offices, other donors, and the INL Director and INL/EA to resolve.<br />3.	In coordination with USAID and other relevant Embassy sections and international partners, draft and implement a plan to reform the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council (HJPC) to help it become more effective and less politicized. <br />4.	Identify existing administrative procedures and other regulations that can be used to more effectively combat corruption, organized crime, and other financial crimes, including asset seizure and forfeiture. <br />5.	Provide advisory assistance to the SPO and other prosecutorial and judicial offices in BiH to facilitate and encourage effective prosecutions for violations of Constitutional Orders and other State-level crimes.<br />6.	Identify systemic gaps preventing the equitable administration of justice at the State, Entity, Cantonal, and Municipal levels in BiH, and recommend trainings and other programs to address.  <br />7.	Provide ad-hoc legislative technical assistance as required. <br />8.	Provide regulatory technical assistance, particularly in updating relevant books of rules and other key guidelines.<br />9.	Assess SPO's media strategy, identify weaknesses, and assist in creating a modern public relations and outreach strategy to better explain the role of the SPO and the importance of the rule of law. <br />10.	Mentor select prosecutorial and judicial officials, to include case-based mentoring, as appropriate. <br />11.	Recommend programs to encourage increased cooperation with other states in the region, to include joint trainings and personnel and information exchanges, on issues of common concern. <br />12.	Provide other related advisory and training assistance as the position may require from time to time. <br />13.	If required, serve as Agreements Office Representative, Contracts Office Representative and/or Grants Office Representative for INL implementing instruments, and complete the training required for such roles.</p>
<p>TRAINING &amp; DISTANCE LEARNING COURSES<br />1.	Complete the Contracting Officer Representative (PA296) distance-learning (DL) course through the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) within 120 days of arriving at post.  <br />2.	Complete the Introduction to Working in an Embassy (PN113) distance-learning (DL) course through the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) within the first six (6) months of arriving at post.<br />3.	If applicable - Complete the mandatory Foreign Affairs Counter-Threat (FACT) Course (OT610) prior to deployment to post.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES/REPORTS<br />1.	The SJA will consult regularly with the INL Director and other U.S. officials and provide written and oral reports on a regular basis for inclusion in the INL Director's monthly update cable to Washington.  <br />2.	The SJA will participate in Post's Law Enforcement Council and other relevant meetings, and will evaluate the effectiveness of programmatic activities on a quarterly basis and make recommendations to the INL Director on any recommended changes.  <br />3.	The SJA will provide an annual report to the INL Director and INL/EA by September 30, to include a summary of key activities; discussion on coordination with other donors and positive examples of leveraging other donors' strengths; examples of significant challenges, achievements, and shortfalls; and recommendations for future work.  <br />4.	The SJA will submit a final end of tour report encompassing the same information as the annual report and including an overall tour summary.</p>
<p>RELATIONSHIP<br />The SJA is supervised by the INL Director at Embassy Sarajevo.  As a subject-matter expert, the SJA will provide advice and implement programs on behalf of the INL Director and INL/EA.  The SJA will also maintain open, timely, and effective communications with various Department bureaus and offices as required to build relationships that address problems with flexible, workable solutions.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) is delegated the authority to act for the Contracting Officer in matters concerning technical clarification, inspection and, after concurrence by the Contracting Officer, acceptance of Contractor performance under the contract, including preparation of receiving reports, and the authorization of progress payments when appropriate.  The COR will coordinate all work with the Contractor and review Contractor's performance at significant stages of its development.</p>
<p>In no instance, however, shall the COR be authorized to alter or modify the specifications or the contract terms and the conditions or waive the government's requirement, price, delivery, or other terms and conditions.  Such changes must be authorized, in writing, to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>COMPLEXITY<br />INL programs are highly complex, multi-year, and focused on capacity-building.  Developing and implementing these programs requires excellent judgement, the ability to resolve critical problems, and achieve difficult goals that may impact other programs.  Close coordination within the embassy and strong interpersonal skills are essential.  Programs are often characterized by large obligations of U.S. government funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny.  Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-term implementation and administration of the programs.  Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>
<p>SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS<br />The SJA will perform broad and extensive assignments with high visibility in a complex, dynamic political environment directly affecting the rule of law in BiH.  All activities must be closely coordinated with the embassy country team through the INL Director.  Programming activity could eventually span multiple layers of the state and within governmental institutions and include a wide range of justice sector capacity-building activities.</p>
<p>MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS<br />1.	U.S. Citizen capable of attaining and maintaining a Secret security and medical clearance.<br />2.	A Juris Doctorate from an accredited US university. <br />3.	Demonstrated five years' experience as a prosecutor or defense attorney. <br />4.	Demonstrated three years' experience, at least one year of which specially relates to BiH, working in the prosecution of international war crimes, organized crime, and/or financial crimes.  <br />5.	Demonstrated record of successful state-level prosecutor capacity-building assistance in one or more countries of the former Yugoslavia. <br />6.	Demonstrable legal experience with asset forfeiture and other administrative tools to disincentivize illicit activities and remunerate victims of crime. <br />7.	Demonstrated record of working in a complex and highly charged political environment. <br />8.	Significant experience working and coordinating with relevant U.S. agencies and embassies, foreign governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations.  <br />9.	Superior interpersonal skills.<br />10.	Excellent oral and written English communication skills.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT<br />The SJA will be embedded in the BiH SPO.  Additionally, Embassy Sarajevo will provide desk space, a computer, office telephone, and other supplies as necessary at the embassy.  This property will be owned and maintained by the Department of State.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>FACTOR 1									(40 points)<br />Ability to manage rule of law advising, training, and mentoring programs with the State Prosecutor's Office in coordination with the OPDAT RLA, other relevant Embassy sections, and international partners, as appropriate.

<p>Ability to liaise effectively with U.S. Embassy Sarajevo, the INL/EA Program Officer, other U.S. agencies, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations.

In addition, applications (written materials and interviews) will be evaluated based on content as well as on the applicant's writing, presentation, and communication skills. In the event that a candidate has fully demonstrated his/her qualifications and there are no other competitive applicants, INL reserves the right to forego the interview process.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_X_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_X_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_X_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_X_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_X_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>1330-52.237-72 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO NOAA FACILITIES (SEPT 2017)<br />(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i) Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii) Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii) Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv) Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v) Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b) In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply. If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed.</p>
<p>In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c) The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels. Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d) For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1) Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2) Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3) Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e) Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility. The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access. Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel. Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2) Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue. If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery. Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery. Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities. CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.<br />Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer. The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted ________ hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. If blank, 72 hours applies) before access to the NOAA facility is needed.</p>
<p>(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.</p>
<p>(b) Requirements.</p>
<p>1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.<br /><br />2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.<br /><br />3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>

<p>1330-52.237-71 NOAA GOVERNMENT-CONTRACTOR RELATIONS - NON-PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACT (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a) The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b) Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1) Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.<br />(2) Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c) The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government. Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d) Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e) Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance. In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language. The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor. The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br />(End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>1330-52.270-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.</p>
<p>(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 4:00 P.M. MDT on December 14, 2018. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Diana Romero. The E-mail address is Diana.Romero@noaa.gov and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>
<p>(XVI) Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Diana Romero, (303) 497-3761, E-email address is diana.romero@noaa.gov .</p>

Place of Performance: Fort Pulaski National Monument, Savannah, Georgia, Chatham County

 The Southeast Hurricane Recovery Office is seeking to procure the services of stabilization, conservation and restoration of the Fort Pulaski National Monument Original Sally Port doors.

All interested companies shall provide a quote for the following: 

Scope of Services: 
In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contract, the Conservator shall perform the work of this Statement of Work for the NPS (National Park Service) as described herein.
The services shall include the stabilization, emergency conservation treatment, and restoration for Fort Pulaski National Monument Original Sally Port Doors. In addition to being located in a harsh marine environment, the outer doors were exposed to brackish water flooding by two hurricanes in 2016 and 2017.  Strong winds have also taken their toll on the doors, particularly the latches and their surrounding areas. Necessary work includes stabilization, rinsing, restoration of missing and damaged elements, cleaning of metals and the application of patinas, inhibitors, and restorative and/or protective coatings such as wax.
Performance Period: The work performed under this Scope of Work shall be from approximately December 2018 to September 30, 2019. The contractor must be able to start work within 10 business days after the award document is distributed and receiving the Notice to Proceed from Contracting Officer.
Work Schedule: Upon receipt of the Notice to Proceed by the Contracting Officer, the Conservator shall proceed with the furnishing of the submittals for NPS approval.  Work Schedule and milestones are to be established in writing with the Contracting Officer after receiving Notice to Proceed and will consider the least impact to visitors.   
Hours of Operation:  
The contractor is responsible for conducting business at the site between the hours of 7:00 am to 4:30 pm local time, Monday thru Friday except Federal holidays or when the Government facility is closed due to local or national emergencies, administrative closings, or similar Government directed facility closings.  Work outside of these hours or days will not routinely be approved, and must be requested with the Contracting Officer, in writing, no less than 3 working days PRIOR to days/time requested.  
The contractor will not be reimbursed when the government facility is closed for the above reasons.  The Contractor must at all times maintain an adequate workforce for the uninterrupted performance of all tasks defined within this SOW when the Government facility is not closed for the above reasons.  When hiring personnel, the Contractor shall keep in mind that the stability and continuity of the workforce are essential.  
 Project Identification:
	Project/Package Number: FOPU-244833
The location of the project for which these services are contracted is at the historic Fort Pulaski within the National Park Service unit Fort Pulaski National Monument.
Safety & Access - Special Considerations: 
The conservation work covered in this contract is to be performed on doors of the only entrance/exit to the fort. These doors are also used to secure the fort after hours. Accommodations for access and the continued use of the entrance and doors by both staff and visitors is required. Accommodations must also be made to ensure the safe passage of visitors and staff through the area while work is ongoing during operating hours. 

The work site is directly adjacent to the moat. 
1)	Appropriate safety precautions should be taken for any personnel working closely to a body 
of water.  
2)	A safety plan and spill prevention plan will be required prior to the start of work.  If mitigation of runoff or 
chemical release is required, it will meet the appropriate environmental standards. Costs, both direct and indirect, incurred from mitigation of runoff or chemicals released in relation to the aforementioned work will be the responsibility of the contractor. 
Certain phases of work, such as desalination and application of finishes, will be weather dependent. No work involving water is to occur if the temperature, including wind-chill, is less than 40 degrees F. Contractor should plan accordingly to complete work during the allotted performance period.  
The contractor must provide all necessary equipment, supplies, and personnel to complete this work. The park is not responsible for furnishing anything. 
Park housing is not available for this project. Housing, if required and transportation to and from the site will be the responsibility of the contractor. Park will provide access to and from the site.
I.	PROJECT BACKGROUND
Fort Pulaski National Monument (FOPU) was established by Presidential Proclamation No. 1713 (43 Stat. 1968) on October 15, 1924, and was later transferred to the Department of the Interior as part of the national park system in 1933. The national monument, which sits between Savannah and Tybee Island on the Georgia coast, encompasses 5,623 acres on Cockspur and McQueens Islands. Within this setting, the monument contains a broad range of significant resources that reflect both the natural and cultural history of Georgia on the Atlantic coast.  FOPU preserves and interprets the 19th century masonry fort and associated landscape that illustrate the evolution of civil engineering and military technology, a continuum of historic resources from colonial times to the present day, and approximately 5,000 acres of nearly pristine salt marsh on McQueens and Cockspur Islands in Savannah, Georgia.
Both the inner and outer pairs of sally port doors are original to the construction of Fort Pulaski, completed in 1847. These doors historically provided the only ingress and egress to the fort and serve the same purpose today. Paint remnants on the doors appear to date to the period of historic usage.
Outer Doors
Each of the outer doors measures approximately 6 2 " wide by 1 2 0"high. They are comprised of two layers of planks each 2 " thick. The outer layer consists of 12 vertical members while the inner layer has23 horizontal members. Each plank is grooved and splined along the edges. The wood members are quarter sawn for strength and stability. Wood samples from the doors were identified by the Forest Products Lab as being southern yellow pine, (pinus). Although the particular species of pine could not be identified, visual inspection suggests it is a long leaf pine which is characterized as heavy, strong, stiff, hard and moderately high in shock resistance. The plank layers are joined together by means of ferrous rivets. The exterior rivet heads are hemispherical with the exception of those along the top row and column closest to the hinge. These heads are flattened to enable the door to close tightly against the overlapping stone jamb. Each door is hung on two large ferrous strap hinges that extend the full width. The hinges are affixed to the doors with bolts that have roundheads on the exterior and square nuts on the interior. The irregular appearance of the projecting threads suggest they were made by hand. The ferrous pintles are set into the stone jambs. The lower pintle has an integral pin while the upper pintle has a loose pin secured by means of a wedged shaped key. The lower hinge has a small oil hole above the pintle. The doors are secured by means of a pivoting ferrous bar affixed to the right hand door. In the closed position the bar rests on two ferrous U brackets riveted to the left hand door. A wicket, a small door for individual access, is cut into the left hand door. It swings on two strap hinges and is secured by a large sliding bolt. The wicket is constructed in the same manner as the larger doors and may have actually been cut out of the large door after its fabrication.
Inner Doors 
The inner doors or gates have diagonal latticework and arched tops. The right hand door is latticed top and bottom, while the left hand door is latticed above and planked below the mid-rail. A wicket is set into the planked portion of the left hand door. The doors are approximately 4 " thick, 144" tall and 5 4 " wide. The lattice-work is comprised of four layers varying from 1-1/8" to7 / 8 " thick. The layers are affixed to one another with flush rivets, screws and cut nails and set into grooves on the inner edges of the rails and stiles. The doors are hung on hinges similar to those found on the outer doors and are affixed with round head bolts and square nuts. They are secured with a bar that pivots on the right hand door and rests in two U shaped brackets on the left hand door
II.	STANDARDS

The F-35s advanced airframe, autonomic logistics, avionics, propulsion systems, stealth, and firepower will ensure that the F-35 is the most affordable, lethal, supportable and survivable aircraft ever to be used by so many warfighters around the world. <br /><br />The F-35 JPO seeks to better understand the air vehicle and engine sustainment supply chain. The business environment presents a number of challenges to those concerned with Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) as new technologies, teaming partners, and vendors are constantly changing at an increasingly fast rate. Additionally, the F-35 JPO Supply Chain extends well beyond the United States.

<p>The Government intends to sole award a firm fixed price purchase order to Alta Data Technologies LLC, (CAGE Code 4RK27), 4901 Rockaway Blvd. NE Ste. A, Rio Rancho, NM, 87124-4503, for 34 each ENET2-1553-1D-E Ethernet appliances with one channel of dual redundant MIL-STD-1553. This acquisition will be conducted using simplified acquisition procedures with a total estimated value of $142,868.80. The Government's minimum needs have been verified by the certifying technical and requirements personnel. This memo does not authorize acquisition for other requirements. This purchase will be funded with FY19 OPN funds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Identification of the justification rationale and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service. 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B). Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B). The items being purchased are part of the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). These parts are part of a build to print data package whose assembly will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to an Alteration/Installation Team (AIT) for integration with SBC4 installation kits. The Ethernet appliances being purchased are commercial items manufactured by Alta Data Technologies as part of the end item assembly. Developing another source would be expensive as there would be significant reoccurring engineering and testing costs (environmental) and time associated with the effort estimated at $150,000 adding additional twelve-month lead time. As such, the Government does not expect significant savings through competition and does expects significant and unacceptable delays that will negatively impact this requirement. Therefore, it is in the Governments' best interest to award on a sole source basis to Alta Data Technologies LLC. See attached redacted justification and sources.Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts. CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification. This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended. FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy: adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems. Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /><br />Information Safeguards<br /><br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a. Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b. Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c. Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system. However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /><br />a. Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b. Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c. At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d. Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e. Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /><br />f. Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g. Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /><br />h. Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j. Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /><br />(1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /><br />(2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k. Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l. Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information: facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>

<p><br />Requirements: <br />* Provide sample menus, with cost per meal per person per day.

Please provide details as to how hotel staff will accommodate dietary restrictions and allergies.<br />* Approximately five guests will require either or both vegan and gluten-free meals.&nbsp; These meals should be plated and served separately.&nbsp; <br />* Labels to identify each food item are required for meals and breaks. <br />* Buffet meals are preferred, as all meals must take no more than 1 hour each. Please specify in your proposal how the venue will ensure guests are served and have enough time to eat comfortably within 1 hour for each meal. <br />* A staff member should be able to answer questions about food preparation and ingredients at all meals.<br />* A certain number of guests (TBD) will not be covered by the purchase order but will be eating meals with the group at various time (including the banquet) The selected bidder will be required to establish and maintain payment processes for all participants who are not covered by the PO. The Foundation will provide the venue with a list of participants who ARE covered by the PO in advance of the event. BEO numbers may include combined counts (PO + separate credit card charges) but the bill provided to the Foundation after the event must clearly denote the number of guests on the PO vs. paid separately for each meal (before tax and gratuity, and after). <br />* The Foundation may request a tasting appointment for 2-3 people to allow for a determination on food quality.</p>
<p>Banquet event: <br />Saturday evening, August 10, there will be a banquet and awards ceremony celebrating the Scholars.&nbsp; The plated meal will include 3 entr&eacute;e selections; one chicken, one vegetarian option, and one fish option. A vegan and a gluten-free plated meal must also be provided for the approximately five guests who require these options. Additional guests, not included in the Foundation purchase order, will pay the venue separately for their meal. We will specify the number of each entr&eacute;e ahead of the event. The total number of guests for the meal will be approximately 120.</p>
<p><br />Coffee Breaks:&nbsp; <br />In addition to breakfast, lunch, and dinner, we require one or more coffee breaks each day.</p>
<p>Coffee break costs are at the discretion of the venue and are expected to be a competitive point across bids.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Requirements: <br />* Provide sample menus, with cost per person <br />* Include any quantity discounts that can be offered (eg lower cost/ person over 20 people, etc.)<br />* Labels on each food item are required.<br />* Dietary restrictions must be considered for break, same as meals, and plated. <br />Special Considerations<br />There will be a number of guests and participants who will pay for their own hotel rooms, meals, transportation, and incidentals. These individuals will be required to pay the hotel directly for all services provided and payment must be communicated and coordinated by the venue. However, these individuals have been accounted for in the meal counts (but not guest room counts) estimated above. Therefore, the Purchase Order for this event will almost certainly amount to more than the final Purchase Order for payment, because those amounts are calculated here, but will be paid separately. We expect at least 10 people to pay separately for various lunches and dinners throughout the event, and at last 30 people to pay separately for the banquet meal on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Format of the Invoice:<br />Because the Purchase Order will outline costs by category (Lodging, F&amp;B, A/V, Transportation) the invoice provided to the Foundation following the event should also include details for each of these categories. For example: Food and Beverage should include the number of people at each meal, with those who paid separately subtracted before a total is provided, and before gratuity and tax are added. Audio Visual items should be detailed per item per day, with costs totaled per day before tax and other additive rates.</p>

<p>The United States Coast Guard Surface Force Logistics Center has a requirement for the following:<br />SERVICE: This work item describes the requirements for the Contractor to inspect and repair the transom doors. The scope of this work item includes the following:<br />A. Port and starboard open-close hydraulic cylinders renewal <br />B. Port and starboard locking cylinders renewal<br />C. Weather seals and plastic door guide renewal<br />D. Hydraulic oil renewal<br />E. Transom door preservation</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish and install all protective coverings to seal off and protect all non-affected vessel's components, equipment, and spaces near the work area against contamination during the performance of work. Upon completion of work, the Contractor shall remove all installed protective measures, inspect for the presence of contamination, and return all contaminated equipment, components, and spaces to original condition of cleanliness.<br />3.1.3.1 Protective measures, hydraulic system(s). Maintain existing hydraulic system cleanliness and take all necessary precautions to prevent the introduction of contaminants into the hydraulic system. Immediately after disconnecting or removing components from the hydraulic system, seal all openings to the rest of the system using caps for externally threaded connection points, bolt-on blanks, or taped-on discs/covers made of durable plastic or sheet-metal that is no less than 1/16-inch thick.</p>
<p>NOTE<br />Be aware that plastic bags may be used only when arrangement or configuration prevents the use of the other sealing methods specified above.<br />3.1.4 Interferences. The Contractor shall handle all interferences in accordance with SFLC Std Spec 0000, paragraph 3.3.5 (Interferences). Known interferences include, but are not limited to the following:<br />&bull; Electrical wiring (open-close cylinders and locking cylinders proximity sensors, heat tracer cables)<br />&bull; Hydraulic piping<br />3.2 General description. General arrangement and details of transom door described in this work item are shown in C G Drawing 750-WMSL169-500 and Tech Pub 7794. <br />3.3 Operational test - initial. Prior to commencement of work, the Contractor and the CG Inspector shall witness Coast Guard personnel perform an initial operational test of the transom door to demonstrate operational condition. Check the transom doors for proper operation and that the indicator lights at the Control Station and Bridge Station show the correct status. Both station console indicator lights shall function as described TechPub 7794. Submit a CFR.<br />3.4 Staging. The Contractor shall, in accordance with 29 CFR 1915, Subpart E ( Scaffolds, Ladders, and Other Working Surfaces), erect suitable staging or scaffolding as necessary to facilitate required work in the overhaul of the transom door hydraulic cylinders. This shall include staging over the side of the ship for the removal of the existing rams. Disassemble and remove the staging upon completion of work or when designated by the CG Inspector.<br />CAUTION<br />The Contractor shall utilize any mechanical device such as jigs to ensure that the port and starboard transom doors are secured in place to prevent any movement or shifting of the doors when the open/close and locking cylinders are removed/installed.

The Contractor shall perform the following inspections and repairs to the transom doors:<br />3.5.1 Hydraulic cylinder renewal.

After completion of work and in the presence of the Coast Guard Inspector, the Contractor shall thoroughly test and demonstrate the equipment listed below to be in satisfactory operating condition. Submit a CFR.<br />&bull; Cycle the transom doors from close to open positions and vice versa and check for proper operation and correct indicator lights status at the local operating console at the fantail and status console at the bridge.

EVALUATION APPROACH
The award resulting from this solicitation will be made based on the lowest price technically acceptable to the government, considering technical capability, price, and past performance. 
The government will evaluate information based on the procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.106-2 using the following evaluation criteria:

Technical Capability   The evaluation process will consider whether the quote demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical features involved in meeting the requirements of the solicitation.  

Price   The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. The Government will evaluate price to determine whether or not it is considered fair and reasonable.

Past Performance   The quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the contractor s performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance in providing requirements similar in size, scope, and complexity to this solicitation. The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by the contractor.

All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. Consequently, contractors are highly encouraged to provide their best quote in their initial submissions. However, the Government reserves the right to communicate with any or all contractors submitting a quote, if it is determined advantageous to the Government to do so. If these communications take place, the Government is not obligated to communicate with every contractor (note that FAR Part 15 procedures do not apply; therefore, formal discussions are not applicable). All contractors will be treated fairly and impartially. A contractor may be eliminated from consideration without further communication if its quote is not among those contractors considered most advantageous to the Government based on a lowest price technically acceptable determination.
Quotes that merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement shall be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Contractors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation shall be rated unacceptable and thus will be ineligible for award. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "GO" must be achieved for the Technical Approach factor. Award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote, if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to the technical acceptability of another quote. 
All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Quotes must be submitted via electronic means by 4:30 P.M. ET on October31 , 2018. Quotes must be submitted electronically to FedBid.The quote must contain the contractor s name, address, telephone number, tax identification number, and Duns and Bradstreet Number.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services/items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested.   This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP); the solicitation number is 36C10B19R0006 (see attached document: 36C10B19R0006). 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Information and Technology (OIT) and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Connected Health Office (CHO) have a requirement for sustainment of the VA Online Scheduling (VAOS) Suite.  The VAOS suite consists of three web applications. The first web app, VAOS, enables Veterans to directly schedule an appointment or submit a request to VA scheduling staff members to make an appointment. Features include not only booking appointments into VA primary and specialty care clinic openings, but also VA telehealth appointments and telehealth session support.  Additionally, VAOS is the app Veterans use to check eligibility for community care treatment, search for community providers, and request community care appointments.  VA staff members use the second web app, Scheduling Manager (SM), to process the requests for appointments from Veterans using VAOS.  The third application is the VA Tool Set, (VATS), which is a small staff-facing only application used to configure VAOS at VA Medical Centers and Health Care Systems.  The Government requires Agile development and maintenance support including project management, application lifecycle management, and production troubleshooting and adaptive, preventive, perfective, and corrective maintenance for the VAOS Suite of web applications: VAOS, SM, and VATS apps and related Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA) patches supporting both the VA caregiver community and the external Veteran community.  The effort includes optional tasks to provide continued problem resolution and defect management support and coordination to support all code that was released into production with less than 90 calendar days remaining in the period of performance; Cerner integration feasibility analysis and planning; additional continuous delivery release windows; and transition support.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541512.

Will there be allowances based on the supply of the material?<br /><br /><strong>Answer</strong>: Our market research indicates that most contractors have an established supply chain that should make the delivery times feasible. It is possible that vendors are mistakenly taking the drawing as a "finished part", however,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>it is actually a raw material purchase of aluminum plates with 4 holes drilled into them as specified in the drawing Q7375-01.

It offers a compact external storage chassis capable of accommodating drives with a SAS 12 Gb/s or SATA 6 Gb/s interface. The box can support both 2.5" and 3.5" disk drives, each one contained in a disk carrier. This compact tower provides one 6 Gb/s SFF-8088 SAS and four 12 Gb/s SFF-8644 connections. Out-of-band CLI can be redefined to the manufacture default setting on those connections. Configuration and environmental information are accessible either via in-band (SES-3.0 over SMP) or out-of-band serial port.
The ARC-4038 includes 8 internal plus 20 external SAS 12 Gb/s ports for host and easy expansion. It features SAS and LSI DataBolt bandwidth optimizer technology. This enclosure is compatible with SAS-enabled systems as well as 6 Gb/s drives and backplanes. Using DataBolt, the ARC-4038 buffers 6 Gb/s data and then transfers it out to the host at 12 Gb/s speeds in order to match the bandwidth between faster hosts and slower SAS or SATA devices.
The ARC-4038 contains an embedded expander manager that can access via in-band SES-3.0 over SMP protocol and out-of band RS-232 port. The ARC-4038 expander firmware and EPLD has implemented the SES-3.0 protocol and disk activity map to the individual fault/activity status indicator on the backplanes. It has autonomous chassis management of the power supply status connectors and two fan monitor/speed control connectors through the SES-3.0 protocol. The hardware monitor can keep track of system voltage and temperature as well as offer a warning message via an alarm buzzer and the corresponding LED.
The ARC-1883X PCIe RAID controller offers increased performance and improved enterprise data protection. This low-profile card is equipped with a 1.2 GHz dual-core ROC processor, 2GB of DDR3-1866 memory, and PCIe 3.0 interface. It supports up to 256 drives and provides two SFF-8644 ports. The drives are preconfigured in a single RAID 5 array, providing 70TB of usable storage.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_X_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Any requirements within the RFP shall be adhered to.<BR><BR>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer
conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The
following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Delivery - Ability of the offeror to provide the product/services in the time specified in the solicitation document.
Ability to meet specification -Ability of the offeror to provide the product/services based on the specifications as
spelled out in the solicitation shall be included in your proposal package. Material Data Safety Sheet shall be
included in your proposal package.
Past performance
Offerors will be evaluated on their record of relevant, and recent past performance, from the Business Questionnaires
submitted, and information received from past contracts and any additional-data obtained by the Government, i.e.,
current contracts. Relevant past performance is defined as having a record of actual performance or accomplishment in
the production of Wire Decking on contracts similar in scope to the requirement being evaluated. Recent past
performance information is defined as contracts performed within the last three (3) to five (5) years.
In evaluating offerors past performance, the Contracting Officer will consider the following: adherence to contract
schedules, cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and the timeliness of performance taking into
account excusable delays.
Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the corrective action taken.
The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when
evaluating the offerors past performance. Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall
negative trends.
In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is
not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
Price
Technical factors are significantly more important than price. Quality, delivery, and customer service will be
evaluated under past performance.
The relative order of importance of the evaluation factors, such as in descending order of importance as listed above
Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror
within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by
either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer),
whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before
award.
The following are the adjectival ratings:
Poor Unfavorable
Marginal More unfavorable than favorable
Good More favorable than unfavorable
Excellent Entirely favorable<BR><BR>(a) Twelve (12) months after contract award date, and every twelve (12) months thereafter, contract prices for the
succeeding twelve (12) month period may be adjusted in accordance with the change in Producer Price Index for
PCU325998325998, "Other miscellaneous chemical product manufacturing" using the simple percentage method described in
the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics "Escalation Guide for Contracting Parties, available at
http://www.bls.gov/ppi/ppiescalation.htm (calculated as follows: index at time of calculation, divided by index at
time base price was set, and the result multiplied by base price, equals adjusted price).")]. IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S
RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST THIS ADJUSTMENT.
(b) Adjustments may be requested after the preliminary price index for the month of the anniversary of contract award
has been published but not to exceed 90 days after the eligible adjustment date (i.e., anniversary of the contract
award date). Requests that are made after the 90-day limit will not be honored and the contract pricing will not be
adjusted. The contractor shall submit any requests for adjustments in writing to the contracting officer. Requests
shall include a copy of the relevant index and must be within the allowed time period for adjustment. Any adjustments
authorized as a result of the adjustment request will not be retroactive. The date the completed request is received
by the contracting officer will be the effective date of any changes in price. Economic price increases will not be
granted if the contractor has any past due orders at time of request.
(c) The contractor also is required to request downward price adjustments. All downward adjustments will be
retroactive to the authorized adjustment date as specified in this clause. If downward price adjustments are not
requested and this is later revealed through audits or otherwise, the contractor shall reimburse the Government the
amount overcharged plus interest. Interest will be computed at the rate set annually by the Secretary of the Treasury
for late contract payments. Interest will accrue from the date the adjustment should have been made.<BR><BR>(d) In computing any price adjustment, the preliminary/first-published index for the month and year of contract award
will be compared to the preliminary/first-published index for the contract anniversary month of the adjustment year.
This index is not seasonally adjusted. If this index is temporarily unavailable or permanently discontinued, the
contracting parties shall either use the index one level up (i.e., the broader index under which the selected index
was listed) or agree in writing upon a substitute index.
(e) No adjustment shall be made if the referenced change is less than 2%. Total upward adjustment for the contract
period, including any option periods, shall not exceed 10% of the original contract base price, based on the original
or option period contract price; downward adjustments are not limited.
(f) Indices are available from [SOURCE/CONTACT INFO/WEB ADDRESS (for example "PPI data can be obtained from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics website, by emailing the PPI at ppi-info@bls.gov, or by calling (202) 691-7705.)].<BR><BR>

<p>Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Notice (December 18, 2015) <br />(a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194), require that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.<br />(b) Accordingly, any offeror responding to this solicitation must comply with established HHS EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. The complete text of the Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards.<br />(c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are stated in the clause at 352.239-74, Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility.<br />In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT supplies meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must submit an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining whether proposed EIT supplies conform to applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows offerors or developers to self-evaluate their supplies and document-in detail-whether they conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard, and any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template are available under Section 508 policy on the HHS website http://www.hhs.gov/web/508.<br />In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must provide enough information to assist the Government in determining that the EIT services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards, including any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues.<br />(d) Respondents to this solicitation must identify any exception to Section 508 requirements. If a offeror claims its supplies or services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and it is later determined by the Government, i.e., after award of a contract or order, that supplies or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.<br />(End of provision)</p>

<p><br />1.	Introduction and Background</p>
<p>MCC's mission is to provide grant assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in select developing countries with a demonstrated commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC's partner countries enter into a five-year agreement (Compact) with MCC that includes a plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives. Our model is defined by core principles, of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results.</p>
<p>Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. Our Values are CLEAR: Embrace Collaboration, Always Learn, Practice Excellence, Be Accountable and Respect individuals and ideas. MCC's values define how we behave on a daily basis, both as individuals and as an institution, in pursuit of our mission. They guide how we make decisions, set priorities, address challenges, manage tradeoffs, recruit and develop staff, and work together with our country partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>2.	Scope of Position</p>
<p>The Department of Compact Operations (DCO), Sector Operations Division (SO) is seeking an Intermittent Personal Services Contractor (PSC) to serve as an Associate Director or Director in the Gender and Social Inclusion (GSI) Practice Group. The PSC shall serve as a GSI lead for projects in at least two countries in various stages of development and implementation. The PSC will also support GSI's technical leadership role to build and share knowledge and best practices on effective integration of social inclusion strategies.</p>
<p>The PSC will report to and be supervised by the Practice Lead and Senior Director (PLSD) for GSI.</p>
<p>This position is not authorized to supervise any Federal employees.</p>
<p>3.	Personal Services Contract</p>
<p>MCC is authorized to enter into a contract with an individual as a Personal Services Contractor (PSCs) under the authority of Section 614(a) (8) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003.</p>
<p>A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSCs is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSCs is subject to most of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The following elements apply to this contract:<br />(1)	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />(2)	Principal tools and equipment may be furnished by the Government.<br />(3)	Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission.<br />(4)	Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel.<br />(5)	The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year.<br />(6)	The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to-<br />(i)	Adequately protect the Government's interest;<br />(ii)	Retain control of the function involved; or<br />(iii)	Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee.</p>
<p>4.	Key Requirements</p>
<p>Awardee must satisfy the following key requirements:<br />&bull;	U.S. citizenship.<br />&bull;	Must be able to obtain and maintain a federal security clearance.<br />&bull;	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />&bull;	Domestic and international travel will be required.<br />&bull;	Statement of Employment &amp; Financial Interest (e.g., Office of Government Ethics "OGE Form-450" or similar statement) may be required.<br />&bull;	Active System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) registration (this is a free, Government website) and be listed as sole-proprietor.<br />&bull;	Designated and/or random drug testing required.</p>
<p>5.	Duties</p>
<p>a)	Major Duties and Responsibilities (for both Director and Associate Director Levels)</p>
<p>1.	Works with MCC country team and country counterparts in conducting economic and social analysis of the distribution of power, identification of socially excluded or disadvantaged groups, including gender differences, in order to support of Threshold or Compact program development. This would include, but not be limited to, the following:<br />&bull;	Review documents produced by various stakeholders (e.g., government, donors, NGOs, private sector, academia, etc.) on social inclusion and gender equality issues within a country.<br />&bull;	Analyze data and review economic and social analyses to understand the relevance of gender, poverty, and other socio-cultural and socio-economic differences that impact the constraints to and opportunities with respect to economic growth and poverty reduction.<br />&bull;	Conduct stakeholder interviews and consultations in country to gather relevant information on trends, issues, perceptions in the country.<br />&bull;	Develop terms of reference for and manage consultants to undertake GSI analytic work.</p>
<p>2.	Working closely with other MCC colleagues and country counterparts, make recommendations on ways to further inclusion of disadvantaged groups and women's economic empowerment in compact/threshold program and project design. This would include, but not be limited to, the following:<br />&bull;	Within identified MCC sectors and sub-sectors, identify and analyze data related to gender and social inequalities constraints and opportunities and implications for project design. <br />&bull;	Integrate social inclusion and gender objectives in Economic Analysis and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) documents, including program and project logics.<br />&bull;	Draft GSI sections/inputs into MCC compact development documents and Terms of References (TORs) and deliverables for feasibility studies, design studies and contracts, and other GSI-specific or inter-sectoral procurements.</p>
<p>3.	Advise and support country counterparts and work closely with other MCC colleagues during compact implementation through closeout in assigned MCC partner countries. This would include, but not be limited to:<br />&bull;	Provide technical support and assistance to build capacity of in-country counterpart as appropriate.<br />&bull;	Review and clear documents related to compact implementation and closeout, such as Terms of Reference, bidding documents, RFPs, work plans, budgets, reports, deliverables, closeout plans and reports, and other documents as needed.<br />&bull;	Reviewing and analyzing M&amp;E documents, such as M&amp;E Plans, TORs, surveys, indicators, and reports.<br />&bull;	Work collaboratively with ESP colleagues on resettlement program, Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs), including identifying risks for trafficking in persons and community engagement strategies.<br />&bull;	Supporting the MCA staff in the oversight of the GSI-related work. Participate in MCA workshops, meetings with key stakeholders, etc.</p>
<p>4.	Supports MCC's GSI practice group through drafting and review of technical papers, guidelines, leading and participating in meetings and workshops across MCC as requested.  This would include, but not be limited to:<br />&bull;	GSI knowledge base of how to effectively integrate gender and social inclusion issues into MCC sectors (e.g., transport, water, energy, land, and education sectors).</p>
<p>5.	Other duties as assigned.</p>
<p>b)	Travel</p>
<p>MCC estimates that the incumbent will be required to undertake 3-4 international trips annually.</p>
<p>c)	Supervisory Controls</p>
<p>As a recognized authority in the development and implementation of GSI programs and operations, the employee is subject only to administrative and policy direction concerning overall project priorities and objectives. The employee is typically delegated complete responsibility and authority to plan, schedule, and carry out major projects concerned with the analysis and evaluation of programs or organizational effectiveness. Analyses, evaluations, and recommendations developed by the employee are normally reviewed by management officials only for potential influence on broad agency policy objectives and program goals. Findings and recommendations are normally accepted without significant change.</p>
<p>d)	Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of general administrative policies, and program, management and organizational theories which require considerable adaptation and/or interpretation for application to issues and problems studied. Policies and precedent studies provide a basic outline of results desired, but do not go into detail as to the methods used to accomplish the project. Within the context of broad regulatory and procedural guidelines, the employee refines or develops more specific guidelines, such as implementing new or revised processes, methods and procedures.</p>
<p>e)	Complexity</p>
<p>The employee plans, organizes, and completes analytical studies involving substantial aspects of key agency programs. As study coordinator, the employee assigns segments of the studies to various participants who are subject-matter specialists in fields appropriate to the study, coordinates the efforts of the group, and consolidates findings into a completed project. There is extreme complexity and difficulty in identifying the nature of the issues or problems to be studied and in planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of the studies. The nature and scope of the issues are largely undefined. Difficulty is also encountered in separating the substantive nature of the programs or issues into their administrative, technical, political, economic, fiscal, and other components, determining the nature and magnitude of the interactions, discerning the intent of legislation and broad agency policies, and determining how to translate the intent into recommended program actions. The work involves efforts to develop and implement programs based upon new or revised legislation requiring consideration of the immediate sequential, and long-range effects, both direct and indirect, of proposed actins on the public, other government programs, and/or private industry.</p>
<p>f)	Scope and Effect</p>
<p>The purpose of the work is to perform very broad and extensive studies related to MCC programs which are of significant interest to the public, Congress, and MCC Compact country governments. Studies frequently involve extensive problems of coordination in fact-finding and in reviewing and evaluating recommendations in interested agencies or with outside groups. Recommendations involve highly significant programs or policy matters, and result in substantial redirection of federal efforts or policy related to major national issues. Results of work are critical to the mission of the agency or affect large numbers of people on a long-term, continuing basis.</p>
<p>g)	Personal Contacts/Purpose of Contacts</p>
<p>Personal contacts are with high-ranking officials from outside the agency at national or international levels in highly unstructured settings. Examples include other agency heads, top congressional staff officials, or executives of comparable private sector organizations.</p>
<p>Personal contacts include individuals and groups at all levels of the Corporation, representatives from other Federal agencies/organizations, MCAs, contractors, and the general public. The purpose of contacts is to influence, motivate, persuade or negotiate with others who may hold different points of views in order to influence managers or other officials to accept recommendations or to obtain the desired effect.</p>
<p>h)	Physical Demands</p>
<p>The work is primarily sedentary, although some walking, bending, or carrying of light items may be involved. Travel may be required.</p>
<p>i)	Work Environment</p>
<p>Work is performed in an office setting, although there is an expectation of work in the field.</p>
<p>6.	Deliverables</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">Question 1:</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a reference to a replacement of the existing system (C.1). Are you able to provide the name of the existing system, along with the current vendor?</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><span style="COLOR: #c00000"><strong>Answer 1:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adobe Connect. </strong></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong><span>Question 2:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In C.2.1.3, </span><span style="COLOR: #1f497d; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-themecolor: text2">please confirm you are looking for the Contractor or Sub-contractor to come on-site to deliver, install and implement the System. Can it be installed remotely, or can assistance be provided to SAA staff to install and support the system supported by a dedicated Technical Account Manager?</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong><span>Answer 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Contractor or Sub-contractor can perform the install remotely. Whomever has access to the server to do the install and/or maintenance will be required to complete the Senate's CyberSecurity Awareness training and pass a background check.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A dedicated account manager should be assigned, but that person does not need to be onsite</span>.</strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><span><strong>Question 3:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In C.3.7 you request hardware support and on-site support.&nbsp; Are you expecting a tech to be on-site year round or are you only including this for when it is necessary and remote work becomes impossible? &nbsp;In section C.2.1.3 it is stated that the hosting will reside on SAA owned servers, maintained by SAA.&nbsp; Does the US Senate have servers or virtual servers that will be utilized as equipment for the installation?&nbsp; If so, what virtual system is used and what are the specifications of these servers.&nbsp; If virtual servers are used, would the contractor be expected to support hardware or only software?</strong></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><span style="COLOR: #c00000"><strong>Answer 3:<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tech should not need to be onsite year round. They will only support the software, and that can be done remotely, as described in Answer 2. The appropriate hardware will be selected based on the needs of the solution and will be included in the scope on an "as needs" basis.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong><span>Question 4: </span><span style="COLOR: #1f497d; mso-themecolor: text2"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The On-Demand learning component of our solution can be hosted on SAA servers. The live virtual classroom component of our solution is hosted in an AWS FedRAMP compliant hosting infrastructure. No user data is stored this part of our solution. All user authentication is done through the On-Demand learning component of our solutions and all learning completion information is stored there as well. Finally, all data integration with other systems is also done in the On-Demand learning component. Will a solution like this be considered by the SAA to be compliant with C.2.1.3?</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><span><strong>Answer 4: <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our CyberSecurity team will be part of the review process, during which they will determine if the solution meets our required Cyber protections. If the solution is identified as meeting the appropriate protections, it will be considered.&nbsp;<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">Question 5:</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Senate requires that the System authenticate end-users through their Senate network credentials (C.2.1.6). Will this require our application to have integration with PIV Cards?</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><span style="COLOR: #c00000"><strong>Answer 5: <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No. </strong></span></p>

What is the total population of users who are accessing the current system or will access the new system? As we understand it the total amount of employees who might use this system would be approximately 10,000 including Senators and staff. Is that a correct assumption? Will Senators and staff use this system for meetings with Senators constituents as well? This information will assist us in the technical sizing and scoping of our solution.</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong><span style="COLOR: #c00000">Answer 6:</span><span style="COLOR: red"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="COLOR: #c00000">The application will be used solely by those providing training to the Senate staff, which is a total of 20 staff. No other offices will be using this system to provide webinars or meetings. The maximum number of concurrent users will be no more than 300. The total population of the senate is approximately 8000, but our historic data shows that we have about 30 - 50 attendees at each training, or 300 users concurrently, is a high estimate. </span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong><span>Question 7: </span><span style="COLOR: red"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="COLOR: #1f497d; mso-themecolor: text2">In C.2.1.9 you are requesting support for 1-300 simultaneous users, yet in C.2.1.2 and C.2.2.8 you mention 100 concurrent users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please clarify requirements.</span></strong></p>

<DESC>1. Contract Information: The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission. This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Phase B of the Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA).
<p>These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute (40 USC Chapter 11), and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6. The majority of the work will be located in NWD (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts), with the potential for work on EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to three (3) HUBZone firms sharing $6 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that more than three (3) contracts should be awarded, based on the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all.</p>
<p>This announcement is open to all HUBZone Certified Businesses. Firms are required to maintain their self-certified HUBZone status throughout the life of this contract, or they automatically become ineligible for task order awards. The ordering period for each contract will be three (3) years with an option for two (2) additional years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded no earlier than August 2019.</p>
<p>Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract ordering period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, knowledge of locality and capacity. These task orders will be firm fixed-price type orders. There is no limit on the value of individual task orders (aside from the $6 million total capacity threshold) and the period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services. For the purposes of this procurement, a business is considered a HUBZone Business if it has been certified as a HUBZone business with the Small Business Administration, and therefore meets all of the HUBZone program qualifications, as such. Under the Selection of Architects and Engineers statute, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as engineering studies, preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, proposed plan, decision document, design, and Title 2 Services.</p>
<p>When the requirement is identified, the government will notify all contractors in the pool that an evaluation will be conducted. The notification will include whether the contractor's SF 330 will be used, or if the government requires unique experience or qualifications to be submitted for the task order evaluation. Specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality will be considered for task orders to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work.</p>
<p>The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. A Request for Price Proposal (RFPP) will be issued to the selected firm for each task order.</p>
<p>The Service Contract Labor Standards statute is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts (task orders). The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act. Service wage rates will be determined based on the locality where the services will be performed.</p>
<p>Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be eligible for contract award. In order to register in SAM, a firm must have a Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). If a firm does not have a DUNS number, one can be requested by visiting D&amp;B at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Part 22.1303, all firms must complete their VETS-4212 report. Information can be found at the Department of Labor website https://www.dol.gov/vets/vets4212.htm, or call the service center at 1-866-237-0275; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNS number.</p>
<p>2. Project Information: Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required. It is anticipated that a majority of the work will be performed within NWD under the CERCLA regulatory framework. These contracts may be used to provide A-E services for EPA Region 2 projects.</p>
<p>Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting. Selected firms will work on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental projects, including, but not limited to contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, underground storage tanks and fueling systems, and habitat restoration and mitigation.</p>
<p>Assignments may include Preliminary Assessments, Site Investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, human health and ecological risk assessments, Proposed Plans, Decision Documents, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, vapor intrusion studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking design drawings), Five Year Reviews, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, storm water design (including drainage studies and hydraulic modeling), evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, assorted engineering studies and other related services. Task orders may be assigned for any work (HTRW, civil, or military) within the jurisdiction of Northwestern Division or EPA Region 2, but the selection will be based on HTRW program criteria as described in Section 3 Primary Selection Criteria.</p>
<p>3. Primary Selection Criteria: Selection of the firms will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance, first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion. Criteria A through E are primary criteria and will be evaluated for all offerors.</p>
<p>(A) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm demonstrated for a broad range of CERCLA HTRW work performed under the CERCLA regulatory framework. Firms will be evaluated for experience and competence in sub-criterion 1 and 2 below. The most highly qualified firms will have experience in all of the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Remedial Investigations, Risk Assessments (human health and ecological), Feasibility Studies, execution of field investigations including soil and groundwater sampling, and installation of monitoring wells. Experience providing services for HTRW projects located within NWD should also be demonstrated. Direct experience in these areas will be given more consideration than the management or oversight of other contractors (e.g. oversight of PRPs or subcontractors). Additional consideration will be given for experience and qualifications by the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms as the Prime/JV. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section F of the SF 330.</p>
<p>2. The Prime/JV firm should demonstrate strong quality management practices by describing quality management roles and responsibilities, by describing their quality management process and procedures, and by documenting application of quality management to field work, work performed by subcontractors, and other engineering work products. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(B) Professional qualifications of a firm's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract. Relevant HTRW work performed under the CERCLA Regulatory Framework by key personnel will be considered. Additional consideration will be given for experience and qualifications of key personnel of the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms and for experience on projects included in Section F. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The number of personnel is addressed under the capacity criterion below. Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in these key disciplines, which are listed in descending order of importance. Responding firms shall submit resumes for each of the following key disciplines: (1) Project Management; (2) Hydrogeology / Geology; (3) Chemistry; (4) Environmental / Civil Engineering; (5) Risk Assessor. A maximum of two (2) resumes for Project Manager, and a maximum of one (1) resumes for each of the other disciplines shall be submitted. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section E and Section F of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(C) Past performance on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. The Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried by the Government for all firms submitting a SF 330. No submittals are required by the offerors for this criteria. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm if none is available from CPARS. When evaluating past performances, the board will determine the relevancy of performance evaluations, and will only consider the 15 most recent and relevant performance evaluations for each firm.</p>
<p>(D) Knowledge of the Locality: The board will evaluate a Prime/JV firm's knowledge and experience with geological features and the state/ local regulatory agencies. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located throughout the USACE NWD (Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Wisconsin and Minnesota). Additional consideration will be given for knowledge and experience of the Prime or Joint Venture (JV) firms. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections F and H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>(E) Capacity: The board will consider available capacity of the key disciplines listed in Criteria B from the Prime/JV firm and its team consultants when evaluating the capacity of a firm to perform the work. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H and Part II of the SF 330.</p>
<p>4. Secondary Selection Criteria: The following secondary criterion will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms. The secondary criterion will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The secondary criterion is Volume of DoD A-E Contract Awards in the last 12 months. Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF 330.</p>
<p>5. Submittal Requirements: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus two (2) copies and one (1) CD or DVD with searchable Adobe PDF files of one SF 330 (08/2016 edition) for the prime firm that includes all team consultants. Include the firm's DUNS number and CAGE codes in the SF 330, Part I, Sections B and C. A maximum of five (5) projects for the proposed team, including joint ventures and teaming partners, shall be shown in Section F. For the five (5) projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed at one site or at a single installation. An IDC contract is not a project. A project may contain multiple task orders or contracts if they are for multiple phases of the project at the same site or installation. Each project in Section F of the SF 330 shall include the contract number, task order number, cost of work performed by firm, and owner's contact information. Project descriptions shall clearly state extent of work performed by the team, percent of work completed, dates when work was performed, and date of contract completion. Projects submitted must be at least 80% complete or completed in 2014 or later for consideration.</p>
<p>Firms should include information regarding the Secondary Selection Criteria in Section H of the SF 330. The SF 330 shall have a total page limitation of 40 printed pages with Section H limited to eight (8) pages, and Part II is excluded from the 40 printed page limit. Double-sided sheets will count as two pages. Page sheets of 11 inches X 17 inches will be counted as two (2) pages if printed on one side, and four (4) pages if printed on both sides. For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 11 pt. font. Solicitation packages are not provided. This is not a request for proposal. Any pages that exceed the page limitations noted, will not be evaluated, nor considered.</p>

<p>Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE)<br />Consolidated Integration and Development Contract (P-CIDC)</p>
<p>Army Contracting Command-Orlando is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify potential sources having an interest and industry technologies available to consolidate the integration and development of the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) platform.</p>
<p>The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement, if a requirement materializes. Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition. All small business set-aside categories will be considered. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding submissions.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) TO BE SUBMITTED. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) is a capability providing the Department of Defense (DOD) cyberspace workforce the ability to conduct cyberspace operations training (including exercises and mission rehearsals), experimentation, certification, as well as the assessment and development of cyber capabilities and tactics, techniques, and procedures for missions that cross boundaries and networks. PCTE provides the capability required to train forces operating in cyberspace in accordance with congressional and DOD mandates.</p>
<p>PCTE's ultimate solution will be a cloud-based training platform to support Cyber workforce with individual through force level sustainment training, team certification, and provide the foundations for a collective training network (i.e. Cyber Flag, Cyber Guard). It will leverage existing architecture and capability, including existing Service tools connected to the various cyber ranges, in order to provide the emulated environments for virtual cyber training. The materiel development activities for PCTE include integrating hardware and software into a training platform that orchestrates event planning, training resources, and after action review into a cohesive and networked training event.</p>
<p>The PCTE platform, in its desired end state, will use integrated virtual machines connecting Cyber Training and Test Ranges. As part of the Cyber Range cloud-based environment, PCTE will have the ability to share resources, such as scenarios and content, and providing additional "maneuver space" such as emulated Red (adversarial), Blue (friendly), Grey (neutral), and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments. It will connect to six geographically disperse Cyber workforce locations and allow individual units to access capabilities and participate in distributed training (called Connectivity). PCTE is not a cyber range; it is every aspect of training exercise means and training systems that would take place in a range.</p>
<p>The PCTE program continually deploys prototype capabilities through competitive Cyber Innovation Challenges (CICs) to the field to include such capabilities as event management, environment creation/replication, and connections into to the Services' Crew Training Facilities. With continued evaluation of the CIC prototypes by Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) personnel, the PCTE platform will evolve based on changes in technology, threat, and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These changes will require software developed by contractors, external vendors, and other Government organizations to be holistically incorporated into the existing platform for rapid delivery.</p>
<p>Product Manager (PdM) Cyber Resiliency and Training (CRT) is currently integrating vendor solutions into the modular PCTE baseline that includes a number of commercial and proprietary products. Integration requires technical data exchange, specifications, and coordination with other contractors to ensure compatibility and selection the best-of-breed cyberspace operations training platform. It is expected the P-CIDC contract will require the integration of software delivered under the CICs to meet identified gaps and integrate new capabilities.</p>
<p>As part of the lifecycle sustainment of PCTE, the PdM CRT has a requirement for a contracting vehicle to continue development operations with the integration of software and hardware enhancements delivered on other contracts as technology insertion occurs while conducting testing, providing periodic system updates, and fielding technology upgrades of PCTE to CMF. In addition, the contract will provide a limited operations and maintenance support for PCTE to ensure high system availability throughout the acquisition life cycle. The contract will be dynamic and agile to support a highly complex joint program operating in a number of classifications at geographically disparate sites requiring 24/7 on-demand accessibility.</p>
<p>The P-CIDC has the underlying need to ensure standardization, synchronization, and management while maximizing reuse, commonality and high system availability while maintaining the systems cyber security posture. The contract must provide for a dynamic mechanisms for multiphase configuration management, development and support, integration and sustainment labs, and technology insertion and growth.</p>
<p>The purpose of the P-CIDC contract is to support the business goals of the PCTE program. These goals include:</p>
<p>&bull; Decreasing time to produce and present training scenarios<br />&bull; Increasing training throughput<br />&bull; Increasing quality of training<br />&bull; Increasing the reuse of training scenarios/emulated environments</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES<br />The Government requires the development and integration of software, hardware and associated levels of testing to support release of PCTE material solution to satisfy current and future PCTE requirements. In this the Government seeks the contractor to deliver a fully integrated training platform involving software and hardware contributions from various sources for integration, to include performing testing prior to fielding the software. This will require such activities that include software development, system integration, test and system delivery and upgrades to ensure compliance with contract requirements and timely delivery of required products. It is expected the system development, integration and release of the PCTE platform will occur with direct Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) user-centric feedback integrated and driving agile six month capability releases.</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor will provide a real time web-based reporting mechanism to collect, store and analyze operations, maintenance, supply, and inventory data of all the sites. This reporting system will provide Government access for the purposes of operations and logistics reviews. A customer call in center will be required providing twenty-four hours per day seven days a week toll-free call-in support services. The contract efforts are to include repairs and replacement stocks for maintaining required Operational Availability (Ao) of 95%; it will include updates to logistic documentation such as provisioning data, tech manuals and drawings, and provide integration instruction and field support for SW and HW upgrades at customer locations. This effort will encompass logistics support and sustainment of Regional Compute and Storage (RCS) nodes over seven locations CONUS and OCONUS.</p>

<CONTACT>Dawn E. Wright, Contract Specialist, Email dawn.e.wright.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p>&nbsp;SUBJECT: Request for information and request for industry engagement for the TARDEC and Detroit Arsenal (DTA) RESILIENT INSTALLATION - Behind the Meter (BTM) Energy Harvest and Storage Pilot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />1. Purpose. To provide information on DTA's plan to lead the way to installation resiliency.</p>
<p>2. Facts.</p>
<p>a. Protecting the homeland against various strategic foreign attacks is a foundational focus of the National Security Strategy (NSS), the National Defense Strategy (NDS) and the Army Warfighting Challenge (AWFC).</p>
<p><br />b. The National Security challenge concerning our critical infrastructure--and the technical innovations which enable that security--include hardening against various natural and man-made disasters including cyber-attacks, electromagnetic pulse (EMP), high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) and increasingly devastating climate extremes.</p>
<p>c. This interconnected problem-set requires a holistic view of the challenge, and the ability to compel collaboration with experts in targeted industries as well as additional federal organizations piloting various resiliency efforts within other services, resilient cities, utilities, academia, and the financial community. Technology solutions are available to meet the energy resilience targets, though larger barrier facing our ability to project power and evolve at the speed of relevance is the budget or funding mechanisms which will be necessary to enable installation resilience.</p>
<p>d. TARDEC and DTA intend to establish a pilot project to harvest unused/wasted energy production for behind-the-meter energy storage, which properly captured, managed and arbitraged will enable resiliency for specific critical activities. Resilience includes capturing unused or wasted sources of energy and reallocating toward resilience. TARDEC operates dynamometers which emit large amounts of energy that is unused. This project intends to capture behind-the-meter (BTM) wasted energy sources, manage and reuse for critical operations.</p>
<p><br />e. This demonstration project will be a model for collaboration at Department of Defense Active and National Guard installations: engaging in rapid prototyping, testing and evaluation of technology--in parallel to documenting and evaluating various business models, budgets and funding mechanisms required for installation resilience to take hold at scale. This project also demonstrates the Army's ability to manage load shedding and demand response, which in turn creates opportunities for resiliency payback and reinvestment through cost savings and avoidance. Non-monetary gains include the ability to gather and analyze data at the installation and state level, and demonstrate the ability to glean trends that offer insight on a more macro scale.</p>
<p><br />f. This pilot will demonstrate ways to improve readiness, increase lethality, strengthen partnerships, and reform business practices, per SecDef guidance, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Rapid prototyping, testing and evaluation of technology and models, to solve current National Security challenges</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Coordinate with design and construction agents to address industry and bid climate trends</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Increase awareness of project success and failures for all levels of management, from the energy/facility managers to senior leaders at OSD</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Engage collaboratively with industry and academia to encourage knowledge transfer and training to enhance in-house engineering expertise to improve government processes</p>
<p>3. Engagement</p>
<p>a. This is an open invitation to make your company, organization, or other known to us. We are eager to learn of your technology, service, and/or expertise. Please provide contact information and any/all literature or digital media that outlines your potential value to us.</p>
<p>b. In FY19 (TBD), TARDEC and the Detroit Arsenal Garrison will be hosting an Energy Resiliency Industry Day event. Current concept is to clear representatives from your organization for admittance on to the Detroit Arsenal for a day of tours, briefs, and brainstorming.</p>
<p>c. In addition to those in the energy sector, we are eager to engage capital providers such as venture or private equity.</p>
<p>d. Please send responses to the individuals listed below.</p>

If planning on attending one of these site visits, please contact Karl Lautzenheiser at karl_lautzenheiser@fws.gov at least a couple days prior to the site visit. There may be a possibility of a site visit on February 6, 2019 at 10 AM local time. An amendment will be issued if any of these tentative dates/times are changed.   

Date for submission of Questions: Contractors should submit any questions on this project directly to Karl Lautzenheiser at karl_lautzenheiser@fws.gov by no later than close of business on Friday, February 8, 2019. Questions will be consolidated and answers provided by issuance of an amendment directly thereafter.  

The following is an overview of the required tasks. 

Base Bid Item - Pump House Bridge:
 
The proposed project involves the construction of a new bridge located east of Gaston in rural unincorporated Washington County, Oregon. The proposed project will be located within the Wapato Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which is owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and will include the removal of the existing wooden pump house bridge and the construction of the new Pump House Bridge (steel girder bridge) approximately 145 feet to the west of the existing bridge. The new bridge will consist of a 20-foot-wide, 91-foot long steel bridge with curb-mounted guardrails on either side supported by pile supported concrete abutments and gabion retaining walls. The project will also include construction of a gravel access road connecting the new bridge north to SW Gaston Road and a gravel levee access road connecting the new bridge easterly toward the existing pump house.  Access roads will include riprap slope protection and the installation of an access control gate north of the new bridge.  Construction work needed to facilitate the project includes excavation, fill placement, and grading in both upland areas and wetland/waterway areas located on the project site.
 
Optional Bid Item - Gaston Pedestrian Bridge:
 
The proposed project involves the construction of a new bridge located in south of Gaston (adjacent to the Gaston Feed Store), in rural unincorporated Washington and Yamhill Counties, Oregon.  The proposed project will be located within the Wapato Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which is owned and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and will include the removal of the existing wooden bridge and the construction of the new Gaston Pedestrian Bridge in the same location as the existing bridge. The existing bridge once provided pedestrians and vehicles access to the Refuge but currently it no longer provides a safe crossing. The new bridge will consist of an 8-foot-wide, 85-foot-long aluminum truss pedestrian bridge supported by pile supported concrete abutments and gabion retaining walls. The project will also include construction of a gravel access road connecting the existing dirt access road to the new bridge, and the existing levee will receive a new gravel access to account for the difference in elevations between the new bridge and the existing levee.  Construction work needed to facilitate the project includes excavation, fill placement, and grading in both upland areas and wetland/waterway areas located on the project site.


Basis for award will be "Lowest-Priced, Technically-Acceptable (LPTA)" Source Selection Process. LPTA shall be utilized in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 15.101-2. The lowest priced proposal will be based upon the combined total cost for all bid items. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of an offer meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.  There will be two (2) non-cost evaluation factors:  Recent Relevant Experience and Recent Relevant Past Performance.  To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than `Acceptable' must be achieved for Recent Relevant Experience and Recent Relevant Past Performance.

The Government will first conduct a price analysis to determine fairness, reasonableness and if unbalanced pricing exists. Offerors proposals will then be ranked from the lowest to the highest-priced. The Government will then evaluate the technical proposal of the apparent, lowest-priced offeror. If the apparent, lowest-priced offeror's technical proposal is "Unacceptable" the Government will then evaluate the technical proposal of the apparent, second lowest-priced offeror. This process will continue until a lowest-priced offeror's technical proposal is "Acceptable." 

Once the Government identifies the lowest-priced, technically-acceptable offeror, an award will be made and no other proposals will be evaluated from offerors who proposed higher pricing.  

In determining whether a proposal as technically acceptable, the offeror must submit the following information with their proposal submission for evaluation:

 1. Recent Relevant Experience: Offerors shall be evaluated to determine whether they have performed similar contracts, in terms of scope and price, to the work required within the solicitation.  Offerors shall provide the minimum requested project information on at least one (1) recent, relevant project for a steel girder bridge (ten page limit) and at least one (1) recent relevant project for an aluminum truss bridge (ten page limit).  For a project to be considered, the offeror shall have been the Prime Contractor on it.  Projects do not have to have been with a Federal Agency to be considered.

A project is considered `recent' if it has been completed within the past four (4) years or is currently ongoing (but at least 25% complete).

A project is considered `relevant' if it is similar in terms of scope and price to the work required within the solicitation.  To be considered similar in scope, one project shall demonstrate work experience in steel girder bridge construction and one project shall demonstrate work experience in aluminum truss bridge construction and each of those projects shall have a contract value of at least $750,000.00 or more.  

Please note that FACTOR 1 (Recent Relevant Experience) differs from FACTOR 2 (Recent Relevant Past Performance).  FACTOR 1 determines whether or not an offeror has performed similar work whereas FACTOR 2 evaluates how well the offeror performed.

 2. Recent Relevant Past Performance: Offerors past performance shall be reviewed to determine relevancy and confidence assessment.  Offerors shall provide at least one (1) recent, relevant project for a steel girder bridge (ten page limit) and at least one (1) recent relevant project for an aluminum truss bridge (ten page limit). Projects shall include current points of contact and phone numbers. The contractor is solely responsible for the accuracy of this information as the Government will not pursue incorrect contact data.

For a project to be considered, the offeror shall have been the prime contractor on it. In addition to scope, each project shall have a current or final contract value greater than $750,000.00 and have been completed within the past five past five (5) years or be currently ongoing (but at least 25% complete).  Furthermore, for each project to be considered, the offeror shall have been the Prime Contractor on it.  Projects do not have to have been with a Federal Agency to be considered. Offerors may submit the same projects as those proposed for FACTOR 1 (Recent Relevant Experience).

In addition to the above, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance.  Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contract Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE / Unique Entity Identifiers (i.e. DUNS) of team members (i.e. partnerships, joint ventures, teaming arrangements or parent companies / subsidiaries / affiliates) identified in the offerors proposals, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.

While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the offeror.

 3. Price: The total value of all tasks combined will be assessed to determine the overall Price Fair and Reasonable.  If any of the tasks appear to be unbalanced, a review of the breakdown of each task will be conducted.  

Offeror's prices for each item within the bid schedule shall represent the best price in response to the solicitation.  Prices will be evaluated using price analysis IAW FAR 15.404-1(a)(2) and 15.404-1(b).  Prices shall be evaluated to determine fairness, reasonableness and if unbalanced pricing exists.

Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated.  If price analysis techniques indicate that a proposal is unbalanced, the contracting officer shall consider the risks to the Government associated with the unbalanced pricing.  An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government (no page limit). 

Solicitation Number 140F0119R0002 with attachments is being posted on or about December 3, 2018 with proposals due by 2 PM PT on February 22, 2019.  Proposals submitted by mail channels must be received by no later that date/time specified with a 20 percent bid bond or proposals can be emailed to karl_lautzenheiser@fws.gov along with a copy of the bid bond and the original bid bond must also mailed no later than the date/time for receipt of proposals.

No further notice will be posted on FedBizOpps.  To be considered for award, interested contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) must be completed at this same website.  For technical or contract questions, please contact Karl Lautzenheiser by email to Karl_Lautzenheiser@fws.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources.<br /><br />The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is contemplating establishing a contract under NAICS Code 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services), and the Small Business Standard is $15.0 million, PSC Code R410 (SUPPORT- PROFESSIONAL: PROGRAM EVALUATION/REVIEW/DEVELOPMENT), for assistance with HUD's Office of Healthcare Programs (OHP) for the hospital underwriting and asset management functions and is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to solicit responses from capable sources and capability statements to ensure sufficient competition exists to meet the government's requirements.<br /><br />Please review the performance work statement (PWS), if there are questions, email contract specialist, Robert Caldwell at: robert.e.caldwell@hud.gov with subject line: Integrated Underwriting, Asset Management, and Document Management Solution.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br />The Office of Hospital Facilities currently manages its portfolio with the assistance of a contractor utilizing business risk tools to analyze the portfolio and deliver comprehensive financial risk management services. Our current service provides significant asset management enhancements including advanced financial analysis, analysis of cash flows, and probability of default analysis. While the service offers strong analysis capabilities, it lacks the ability to integrate underwriting functionality, document asset management activities, and store program documents. Historically, underwriting and asset management activities are separate and distinct processes. The effect of these siloed activities has been duplicate data entry, inefficient handoffs between underwriting and asset management, and poorly organized document storage.<br /><br />GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK<br />HUD requires a Contractor who shall provide services to support the review, analysis, collaboration and decision-making process required during underwriting. The service will also, manage and store documents, streamline data entry, provide risk rating capabilities, generate portfolio-wide dash board reports and provide hospital-specific probability of default analysis.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Market Research for Electronic Security Systems and Other Automated Control Systems &amp; IP Cameras
<p>For: National Guard Bureau ESS Program</p>
<p>Classification Code: 63 - Alarm, signal &amp; Security detection equipment</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 334 -- Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing/334290 -- Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing Synopsis:</p>
<p>Commercial Item Description NAICS 334290 - Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. This announcement seeks information from industry, which will be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. This is Not a Solicitation for proposals and No Contract shall be awarded from this synopsis.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville is soliciting comments on a market research basis for IP Camera evaluations. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests. It should be noted that we are looking for equipment manufacturers only.</p>
<p>In order to better serve our customers, we look for ways to improve on existing ESS systems.</p>
<p>The Sources Sought is to solicit input from manufactures about IP Cameras in accordance with the attached Functional Requirements Document (FRD), which will be used to protect various assets within the Army enterprise. The IP Cameras must meet all requirements of the FRD and be fully compliant with current Federal Government cybersecurity policies and requirements (including meeting Country of Origin (COO) and Trade Agreements Act (TAA) requirements) for all components.</p>
<p>We have provided information about the IP Cameras sought for evaluation which outlines the equipment's components, features and functions. We have also provided an excel file matrix which lists each of the individual paragraphs and provides a space for comments beside each of them. Vendors should complete the matrix in full and clearly provide, in the comments section, whether the equipment is currently compliant. Only the equipment's existing capabilities, features and functions should be submitted, not planned product improvements. We are asking that comments be made so that the point of contact listed below can fully evaluate the response for each of the items provided in the excel file.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that we need complete responses to all of the requirements listed in the matrix in order to better evaluate the product. Incomplete responses will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>Responses will be evaluated against the requirements of the FRD by the USACE evaluation team. Those vendors whose responses indicate that the IP cameras are compliant will then be requested to submit two (2) fully functional IP cameras of each model to be evaluated. The USACE evaluation team will then perform:</p>
<p>&bull; Preliminary Cybersecurity Testing of the equipment submitted,<br />&bull; Full Functional Testing of the equipment submitted,<br />&bull; Integration Testing of the equipment submitted.</p>
<p>All tested IP cameras will be given internal evaluation scores for compliance. Up to three (3) of those IP cameras that have the highest evaluation scores will be selected and, upon completion of final Cybersecurity Testing and receipt of an Authority To Operate (ATO), will be used on various Electronic Security Systems (ESS) Projects.</p>
<p>All vendor submissions are due 9:00 AM (Central Time),&nbsp;Thursday,&nbsp;January 31, 2019 and shall be submitted to Project Engineer, Daryl Britton, at Daryl.W.Britton@usace.army.mil and Contract Specialist, Robert Starkey, at robert.starkey@usace.army.mil and ESS-Proposals@usace.army.mil.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1 entitled - "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements," the following information is herein documented regarding the non-competitive justification of the below-stated acquisition.<br />The U. S. Agency for Global Media / Broadcasting Board of Governors (USAGM/BBG) intends to award a non-personal service contract to Hanif Sherzad to serve as a Marketing Representative in Afghanistan and other designated countries. The base agreement is $14,400 (period of performance 1 February 2019 - 31 January 2020) with the option to extend for an additional four (4) one-year periods. The total value of this award shall not exceed $72,000.<br />The action being approved herein is a non-competitive procurement of services required to meet the Agency's need to place USAGM/BBG content on affiliate platforms in the region. The placement of this programming is vital to meet the ever-expanding requirements of the USAGM/BBG's global broadcasting mission. <br />Mr. Sherzad has worked for us since 2010. USAGM/BBG has compelling reasons to establish a new follow-on contract with Hanif for another five years (base year plus four (4) 1-year option to extend the contract term). <br />Per FAR Subpart 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) is the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition, and it is herein cited as follows: "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from "Only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements", full and open competition need not be provided for.<br />The nature of the proposed acquisition requires these unique services to be provided by Hanif in order to ensure affiliate placement with existing affiliate broadcasters be maintained and current in-process affiliates be seen to fruition. The U. S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM/BBG) herein certifies that Hanif Sherzad is the only agent that can meet USAGM/BBG's requirement.<br />The Contracting Officer, with the USAGM/BBG Authorizing Contracting Officer Representative (COR) for this procurement, has determined that the anticipated cost of the Government will be fair and reasonable.<br />This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive quotations or proposals. No solicitation is available. Candidates that believe they can provide equal or superior service that are capable of meeting government's needs are encouraged to identify themselves and provide a substantive statement with descriptive literature and any other supporting information to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of publication of this notice. All information received within 15 days of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government to determine if other candidate can meet the Government's requirements and is capable by the contracting office no later than deadline provided in this notice. Responses may be e-mailed to atgartne@usagm.gov . <br />Pursuant to Contract Subsection I.2 entitled, 52-232-18 AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984), funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond 31 January 2020. The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond 31 January 2020, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.<br />I certify that this justification for the above-stated acquisition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

There was&nbsp;CAT 6 testing of network cables on an Ocean Engineering system, where one calibrated DTX 1800 was rented. The rental of these meters was required because the current meters that belong to PSNS were not available for use. Calibrated meters are required to certify the condition of the equipment. If these meters were not rented the system will not be certified and could not be used to support mission critical deployments.&nbsp;</div>
