In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.
20.   Buyer name, phone#, and email address   Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer Louis Colon, 405-734-8116, louis.colon@tinker.af.mil.

In order to support a future SBIRS GEO 5-6 acquisition, this particular contract action will initiate GEO space vehicle (SV) Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) for various subsystems and components in preparation for production. This acquisition will also procure long lead parts, materials, and assemblies for the spacecraft and payload; and cover maintenance, upgrade, or modification of special test equipment. There are three priced options on this contract action: the Space and Atmospheric Burst Reporting System (SABRS); Dual Band Telemetry, Tracking &amp; Commanding (TT&amp;C); and the streamlined Earned Value Management System. The SABRS priced option will develop a design to incorporate the SABRS payload onto the SBIRS GEO 5-6 space vehicles. The TT&amp;C priced option will develop a SBIRS dual band TT&amp;C design, and initiate the designs of the spacecraft structure, harness, power, thermal, antenna, and communications subsystems and associated software to accommodate the dual band TT&amp;C capability. The streamlined Earned Value Management System will incorporate a waiver for specific tailored processes.</p>
<p>The contract type will be Fixed-Price Incentive (Firm Target) (FPIF). The intended contractor is Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), 1111 Lockheed Martin Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94089-1212. The IS Program Office has contracted with LMSSC over the last 16 years. LMSSC is the original and the only responsible prime source that can deliver the required services. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays; therefore, there are no viable options to obtaining competition for this procurement.</p>
<p>The small business size standard (number of employees) for this requirement is 1,000 under NAICS Code 336414. Contractors interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact LMSSC directly.<br /><br />Points of Contact:<br />Technical: Lt Col David Menke, Program Manager, (310) 653-1934, David.Menke@losangeles.af.mil<br />Contracting: Capt John J Sharkey, Contracting Officer, (310) 653-4570, John.Sharkey@losangeles.af.mil or Lisa Chin, Contract Specialist, (310) 653-4141, Lisa.Chin@losangeles.af.mil<br /></p>

<DESC>The capability to simulate different DC electrical power systems in the laboratory, including high voltage and hybrid powertrain systems is necessary to support development of future Army vehicle platforms and systems.  The majority of current Army platforms and systems utilize a 28Vdc electrical system; however, the proliferation of installed electronic equipment has increased the power demands placed upon this architecture which results in tradeoffs of Space, Weight and Power (SWaP).  Future Army vehicle platforms and systems will require high voltage electrical systems (>600Vdc) capable of supplying load currents up to 1000 amperes DC (Adc) to support these increased load requirements.<br>Existing automotive industry demand for hybrid powertrain systems and associated capability has driven the development of commercially-available systems with this capability, either as a single-channel or as a multiple-channel SYSTEM.  Leveraging this commercially-available capability will increase the capabilities of the Army to investigate these technologies and their applicability to future Army platforms and systems.<br>

<DESC>Solicitation Number:<br>W911QY-11-R-0067<br><br>Notice Type:<br>Presolicitaion<br><br>Synopsis:<br>8/24/2011<br><br>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on behalf of Product Management-Force Protection Systems (PdM-FPS) has a requirement for Full Rate (FRP) production of the Lighting Kit Motion Detection (LKMD) program.  LKMD is a small, modular, unattended tactical ground sensor-based early warning system providing early detection and warning of intrusions. LKMD provides enhanced force effectiveness and situational awareness during all types of combat operations or missions. LKMD further enhances force protection by operating as a tactical stand-alone system, a supplemental device for use with other force protection and physical security systems or as part of an integrated layered situational awareness concept. LKMD provides programmable responses of illumination and/or sound, resulting in increased operational reaction time for individuals, teams, squads or platoons. Capable of being programmed and placed into operation quickly, LKMD allows the soldier to remotely program response configurations and is quickly recoverable. The sensor provides a pre-programmed response of audible/silent alarms and sends data to the hand-held remote control, notifying the operator of a detected target. Upon detection of a target entering the specified area, it activates the modules providing a pre-programmed illumination response.  The Contractor shall fabricate and integrate components of LKMD systems, conduct First Article Test (FAT), obtain Government approval for the tested articles, conduct Production Acceptance Test (PAT) and deliver FRP systems to the designated Government location along with any associated equipment, material, firmware and software.  The contractor will be required to provide pricing data to permit evaluation of the economic order quantities based on proposed discounts.  The LKMD contract will be awarded using full and open competition. It will be a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) production contract. The proposed acquisition approach will be for a five-year (two-year base with three (3) one-year option periods) award FFP IDIQ contract valued at approximately $102M for 25,911 production systems and an initial spares package A single award contract is planned, which will further enable life cycle costs, schedule and performance management efficiency. LKMD procurement FY12-16 is the focus for this requirement.  The Government estimates that proposals shall be due not later than 11:00am on 31 October 2011. Any questions about this requirement must be submitted in writing to Constance Aviles at connie.aviles@us.army.mil.

<DESC><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to PerkinElmer Health Sciences, 710 Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, CT 06484 for maintenance and service on five (5) Envision Multi-Label Readers.<br /><br />This request is for a service contract encompassing five PerkinElmer Envision instruments within NCATS. The PerkinElmer Envision is a multi-label plate reader capable of reading luminescence, fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, and time-resolved fluorescence. These readers are an integral part of the screening operations conducted at NCATS. As such, these readers must remain in nearly constant operation and must be properly tuned for the generation of reliable data. Without proper maintenance, the readers could generate misleading and unreliable data, unbeknownst to the operator. Proper maintenance will also help to prevent instrument failure and avert the loss of expensive, ongoing assays. This service contract will provide one preventative maintenance visit for each instrument and cover the costs (parts, travel, and labor) of any necessary repair. These services will ensure reliable data and hasten repair in the event of instrument failure. Importantly, PerkinElmer is the only provider of this mission critical service and they do not authorize any other parties to service their instruments.<br /><br />Period of Performance: Service Agreement is for a Base Year of 12-Months with One (1) Option Year Period. <br /><br />This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334516 and the Size Standard is 500 Employees. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(TR)-2012-130-RSF may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6151, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Rashida Ferebee, by fax transmission to (301) 480-3345 or by email to ferebeers@nhlbi.nih.gov.

<DESC>Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), has a need for the demonstration of non destructive stave removal from a CAVES Component Test Piece (CTP). The demonstration will require a high degree of precision with water-jet cutting and experience with the urethanes to be removed. This process can only be successfully accomplished by a company that has a history of working with the specific DURA materials to be cut, an engineering staff experienced with work on US NAVY submarine prototypes and material systems, and that already has a working prototype cutter or prototype cutter components in their Research & Development (R&D) pipeline. NSWCCD intends to conduct a non-competitive procurement with AK Services, Everett, MA 02149., which has worked extensively with these materials in the past, is familiar with the NAVY treatment systems, and is experienced with stave removal.
  AK Services, Inc has over 20 years experience in the field of DURA material removal from US NAVY submarines in shipyard environments. General Dynamics Electric Boat Corporation in Groton, CT, and Norfolk Naval Shipyard, in Portsmouth, VA have both contracted AK Services, Inc to service multiple classes of US NAVY assets, including VIRGINIA Class, and SEAWOLF Class submarines. Through this work, AK Services, Inc has become very experienced in multiple DURA material systems and the unique technical challenges each system presents. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
 All submissions received within fifteen days from the publication date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Please reference RFQ N00167-12-T-0036 with all correspondence.

  The contract will cover a five-year period and include estimated quantities of Aileron Trim Actuator Assembly, Rudder Trim Tab Actuator, Electro-Mechanical Linear Actuator, Retractable Landing Light, Oil Cooler Flap Actuator, and Trim Tab Actuator. This requirement will be negotiated on a restricted competition basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to Jonathan Engineered Solutions of Irvine CA for the following items:  6 each Slide Assembly (LH) Model# 1507151-L; 6 each Slide Assembly (RH) Model#: 1507151-R; 10 each Slide Assembly (LH) Model#: 1311023-L and 10 each Slide Assembly (RH) Model#: 1311023-R.  This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. These items are designed into the Multi-Vehicle Communication System (MVCS) equipment tactical racks.  The slides were designed by Jonathan Engineered Solutions to meet critical system requirements, interfaces and are the only configuration approved for use.
   Currently, no other source meets the form, fit, function, and interchangeability requirements for the MVCS equipment tactical racks without redesign of the slide assemblies.  Other slide assemblies would require development and extensive engineering and environmental testing efforts, which would not meet the known deliverable dates for procurement.  Therefore, it is in the Governments best interest to purchase these items from Jonathan Engineered Solutions.  

Interested offeror(s) may submit request(s) for qualification on future requirements via e-mail to Contract Specialist  leslie.obrien@navy.mil within 30 days of synopsis posting date.  Requests must be marked with this synopsis designation number and should include the offerors name, address, telephone number, commercial and government entity (CAGE) code, point of contact, and clearly identify the offerors capabilities.

The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>The space must meet requirements for fire-safety plus handicapped access in accordance with ABAAS guidelines. The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced.</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest should include the following:</p>
<p>1) Building name and address, and location of space in the building.<br />2) Legal description<br />3) CAD drawing of space offered.<br />4) Usable Square Feet offered<br />5) Rentable Square Feet offered <br />6) Percentage of Common Area Factor used to Determine the Rentable Square Feet: ANSI/BOMA defined office area/usable square feet (USF) Offered and Rentable Square Feet (RSF) offered identifying the specific floors and square footage on each (with common Area Factor);<br />7) Rental rate per rentable square foot (based on the GSA Warm Lit Shell).

<p>In the event that a potential Offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government's minimum requirements.<br /><br />Submission by anyone other than the owner or manager of a property must be accompanied by a letter from the ownership granting permission to make a general offering of space. In instances where the Offeror is representing more than one property, the Offeror is hereby notified that they may only participate in negotiations on behalf of one owner.</p>
<p><br />Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease. A fully serviced lease is required. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>
<p>Expressions of Interest Due: May 17, 2012<br />Market Survey (Estimated): May 23, 2012<br />Offers Due: June 23, 2012<br />Occupancy (Estimated): September 30, 2013</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), through the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), administers the Compensation & Pension (C&P) Program for benefits for Veterans, their dependents and their survivors.  Entitlement determinations for disability compensation claims and disability pension claims are made by VBA Rating Veterans Service Representatives (RVSRs) working in VA Regional Offices (VAROs) across the country.  A medical disability examination (MDE) is a critical piece of evidence for determining the extent of permanent impairment and the dollar benefit a veteran is awarded.

Congress enacted the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1996 (PL 104-275) on October 9, 1996, which authorized VA to conduct a limited pilot program to contract for MDEs from non-VA medical sources.  Under PL 108-183, Section 704, Congress granted VA temporary authority to contract out for MDEs, which is in addition to the authority provided in PL 104-275.

VBA has a requirement to provide MDEs from non-VA medical sources based on Public Law 108-183. The purpose of this requirement is to obtain high quality examination reports from responsible, responsive and experienced contractors. The examination reports must provide essential information to support each disability diagnosed for the various areas including, but not limited to, the following: musculoskeletal; organs of sense; infectious, immune, and nutritional deficiencies; respiratory; cardiovascular; digestive; genitourinary; gynecological and breast; hemic and lymphatic; skin; endocrine; neurologic; mental disorders; dental and oral examinations. 

VBA intends to issue a solicitation during FY 2012 for MDE services in support of PL 108-183. Specific details regarding the requirements will be provided when solicitations are issued.  An industry day may be scheduled and/or an RFI may be issued.  If issued, the synopsis would be amended accordingly.

Please note that a pre-solicitation notice was previously issued on November 3, 2011.  The prior notice can be found in FedBizOpps archives by searching under VA79812R0032, or at the following hyperlinks:

https://www.fbo.gov/spg/VA/AFMLOVASS/VASSMD/VA79812R0032/listing.html

The solicitation number has been changed from the original notice to reflect a new solicitation number. The new solicitation number is VA798-12-RP-0110. Any update regarding the requirement formerly referenced under VA798-12-R-0032 will be available under the new solicitation number, VA798-12-RP-0110.

The requirement, as synopsized under VA798-12-R-0032, stated that "VBA has a requirement to provide MDEs from non-VA medical sources based on Public Laws 104-275 and 108-183." The new solicitation under VA798-12-RP-0110 will not seek Medical Disability Examination services under Public Law 104-275; but will seek services under Public Law 108-183.

<DESC>The government intends to make a sole source award to Abiomed, inc. at 22 Cherry Hill Drive, Danvers, MA 01923-2575. They are the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Impella LV Assist Device Catheters. The Impella Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) offered by Abiomed provide temporary circulatory support in case of severe left ventricular failure, during high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), or during high-risk angioplasties. LVADs support a patients' cardiac function, while allowing a surgeon to perform the procedure with less risk. During some procedures, the heart is deprived of blood flow, which can result in heart failure or even death. Many high-risk PCIs are emergency procedures, where the primary goal is restoration of blood flow as quickly as possible.
The Impella LVADs support short-term circulatory support and meets the following criteria:
1.	It is a circulatory support device that is percutaneously inserted. 
2.	It provides direct, active unloading of the left ventricle. 
3.	It does not require atrial (transseptal) puncture as part of the insertion procedure. 
4.	It employs a micro axial pump which is placed in the aorta by means of a catheter. 
5.	It provides single-vessel access through the femoral artery.

<DESC><p>Description:<br />This Sources Sought notice is issued for market research, budgetary and planning purposes only, and is not a commitment of any kind for GPO to procure anything.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) is interested in obtaining information from vendors and industry concerning technology products and systems that could be useful to GPO in meeting certain XML document and/or data authentication capabilities.</p>
<p>In particular, technology for authentication of XML data (in native XML format) is of interest. In addition, technology that can provide efficient and effective re-authentication over time, given that the GPO has permanent public access responsibilities and content integrity is a critical component of our mission.</p>
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>The GPO is the Federal government's primary centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing, and preserving published U.S. Government information in all its forms. Since its inception, under the authority of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO has offered Congress, the courts, and government agencies a set of centralized services that enables them to easily and cost effectively produce printed documents. GPO has offered these publications for sale to the public and made them widely available at no cost to the public through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). The FDLP has also served the purpose of providing permanent public access to government publications.</p>
<p>GPO has implemented digital signature based authentication on certain PDF files that it disseminates on its FDsys web site, and disseminates native XML content on the FDsys site also.</p>
<p>Authentication in native XML format is of interest in this Sources Sought notice. This is not intended to replace the existing digitally signed PDF files GPO disseminates, but to potentially include an authentication option for the native XML content GPO also disseminates via the FDsys web site. For the end users of GPO XML content, XML authentication could apply both to automated content processing as well as individual end user access. In the case of individual end user access, a no cost client approach for XML authentication is of interest. <br />GPO is interested in technical systems in two broad categories of XML content authentication:</p>
<p>1) Hash algorithm based checking using NIST approved hash algorithms (SHA-256, etc.); and<br />2) Cryptographic digital signature authentication and validation using open, internationally recognized and accepted standards compliant technology, such as W3C standards (and the detached signature method in W3C standards).</p>
<p>GPO recognizes that as more Government information becomes available electronically, data integrity and non-repudiation of information become more important to user communities. The primary objective of GPO's authentication initiative is to assure users that the information made available by GPO is official and authentic, using techniques that are efficient and effective and that do not inhibit data re-use. GPO's authentication initiatives are designed to provide users with electronic tools to efficiently and effectively determine that files they download from GPO are authentic.</p>
<p>Opportunity<br />GPO is seeking to better understand the available technology solutions and capabilities that industry can offer which GPO might consider using the near future. The capabilities GPO is interested in specifically are described and documented below in the "XML Content Authentication Capabilities Requirements" section. GPO does not wish to overly constrain options or solutions that industry might have to offer in the context of XML authentication along the lines of the two broad categories defined above in the Background section; respondents to the Sources Sought notice are free to and encouraged to provide innovative solutions to the native XML content authentication capabilities generally outlined in the "XML Content Authentication Capabilities Requirements" below.</p>
<p>Making your Capabilities Known - Requested Information:<br />Vendors should furnish the following information (Word or PDF file) to GPO:</p>
<p>1. Response to XML Content Authentication Capabilities Requirements (see below)<br />2. White Papers<br />3. Comments or Questions</p>
<p>XML Content Authentication Capability Requirements:</p>
<p>1. For Hash based authentication of native XML content, capabilities of interest are:<br />1.1. Ability to validate using the SHA-256 algorithm by comparing the SHA-256 hash value of the XML data on hand against the SHA-256 hash value for that XML data obtained from the GPO FDsys web site.<br />1.1.1. This could be accomplished via a table lookup, if the SHA-256 values for XML content published by GPO were placed into a lookup table for processing.</p>
<p>2. For cryptographic digital signature based authentication, capabilities of interest are:<br />2.1. Capability to perform XML digital signatures in accordance with World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) open, international standards.( [XML-Digital Signature reference: Eastlake, Donald, et al. (2008). XML Signature Syntax and Processing, 2nd Edition, W3C Recommendation, June 2008. See http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/.]<br />2.1.1. Capability to perform XML detached digital signature using W3C standards.<br />2.1.2. Capability to use the Canonical XML 1.1 method [XML-Canonical Reference: Boyer, John and Glenn Marcy (2008). Canonical XML Version 1.1, W3C Recommendation, May 2008. See http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-c14n11-20080502.] when generating and validating a XML digital signature.<br />2.2. Capability to generate and validate XML digital signatures using other open, internationally accepted and recognized, non-proprietary standards (document what that standard(s) is (are) and standards body that has issued it).<br />2.3. Optional capability, if available, to generate XML digital signature (detached signature method) using a Hardware Security Module (HSM).<br />3. Capability to provide an Application Programming Interface (API) or package set of software that GPO and organizations could use or license to generate and validate XML digital signatures in accordance with #2 above. <br />4. Capability to use PKI certificates for XML signature validation (for that type of authentication), that is compliant with W3C standards.<br />5. Capability to provide free client software that would be available for end user validation of the XML digital signature in accordance with W3C international, open standards, for the following end user platforms::</p>
<p>&bull; Operating Systems:<br />&bull; Windows XP<br />&bull; Windows 7<br />&bull; Windows 8<br />&bull; MAC OS 9 - forward compatible<br />&bull; MAC OS X - forward compatible <br />&bull; Ubutu Linux<br />&bull; Linux Red Hat <br />&bull; SuSe Linux</p>
<p>6. Server side XML digital signature generation and signature validation capability for the following server platforms:</p>
<p>&bull; Operating Systems:<br />&bull; Windows Server 2008<br />&bull; Windows Server 2012<br />&bull; Linux Red Hat</p>
<p>7. Ensure integrity and security of XML content.</p>
<p>7.1. For cryptographic digital signature methods, capability to sign native XML using 2048-bit or larger RSA public/private key generation and x.509 v.3 certificate compatibility. Specifications include:</p>
<p>7.1.1. RSA key pair for digital signature in accordance with Public-Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #1.</p>
<p>7.1.2. Certificate format in accordance with International Telecommunication Union (ITU) X.509 version 3 standard.</p>
<p>8. GPO is interested in packaged, commercial off the shelf (COTS) software solutions that might exist to meet the above capability requirements. GPO is also interested in the capability of software vendors that have experience in building similar systems to the capability requirements described above. GPO is interested in what capabilities above COTS software can meet and which ones would require customized software (building on the capabilities of the vendor COTS software).</p>
<p>Response to Capability Requirements:</p>
<p>The submitted response must be 30 pages or less and contain no marketing material. Please also list company points of contact and GSA Schedule number (if applicable).</p>
<p>White Paper: Similar Solutions or Systems:<br />Vendors may also submit a separate document that summarizes the vendor's work on similar systems. The document must be 20 pages or less; however, up to five (5) white papers may be submitted provided that each represents a discrete operational system that has been successfully deployed.</p>
<p>Questions and/or Comments:</p>
<p>The Response to the Capability Requirements, any White Papers and any Questions/Comments in response to this Sources Sought notice must be submitted via email to authgpo@gpo.gov. For consideration, please use the subject heading "XML Content Authentication Market Research: YOUR COMPANY NAME") on the email. Faxed copies are not acceptable.</p>
<p>Background Material<br />All background material will be made available via the GPO FDsys website, as it becomes available at <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/authentication">http://www.gpo.gov/authentication</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command (ACC)-New Jersey located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, in support of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS) is conducting a market survey to identify qualified sources to produce the M739A1 Point Detonating (PD) Fuze along with the Safe and Arm (S&A) Module Assembly utilized in the M825A1 WP Smoke (Obscurant) Projectile. The M739A1 PD Fuze is the Armys preferred, primary fuze for 105mm and 155mm projectiles to address point detonating/delay artillery functions. The M739A1 fuze contains an Impact Delay Module (IDM) assembly. The IDM provides fuze initiation delay based upon the completion of mechanical actions caused by projectile deceleration and will function immediately after passing through the target. On the M825A1 WP Smoke (Obscurant) Projectile, the S&A Module Assembly utilized is similar to the S&A Module Assembly used in the M739A1 fuze. The S&A Module Assembly that is used in the M825A1 is also dual safe, requiring two unique environments to align the explosive train.  A rotor acts as an escapement to prevent the M55 detonator from aligning with the explosive firing train until a safe arming distance is achieved.  Both setback (environment #1) and spin (environment #2) locks preventing accidental arming prior to firing.  During projectile flight, the explosive lead in the S&A, when initiated, will detonate the M825A1 Projectile Burster, which will rupture a Canister Loading Assembly and disseminate 116 felt wedges saturated with White Phosphorous.  As the wedges are exposed to the atmosphere, a smoke cloud is generated which acts as an obscurant.
The Government anticipates soliciting for offerors located within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) for a single award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), contract including a basic award of five (5) ordering periods and an option for two (2) additional ordering periods. The estimated quantity to be purchased over the seven (7) ordering periods for the M739A1 Fuze is 850,000 each and for the S&A in the M825A1 projectile is 80,000 each. Both the M739A1 fuze and the M825A1 projectile S&A shall be manufactured to a Government owned Technical Data Package, drawings, and specifications, which are coded as Distribution Statement D (authorized distribution of technical documents to Department of Defense components and their contractors).
Interested contractors should submit a summary that includes a brief description of the contractor's capabilities to include: parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification/email address, capabilities, past experience as a manufacturer of fuzes or similar items, monthly production capacity and/or potential capacity, possible partnering/teaming arrangements, or if the company is a large or small business and CAGE Code. This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the US Government. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. Interested firms should provide this requested information to Joseph Determan at joseph.e.determan@us.army.mil within 15 calendar days of this publication by electronic mail. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. The Government will accept written questions by email. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, N.J. 07806-5000 on behalf of the Office  of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM CAS) is seeking information from Industry on their ability to produce a precision guidance kit/fuzing solution capable of a delivery accuracy of 50 meter threshold / 30 meter objective Circular Error Probable (CEP) and compatible with current US inventory of 155mm M549A1 and M795 artillery projectiles, propellant and weapon systems as described in the Performance Requirement Document (PRD)  Revision 11, Jan 11 for Precision Guidance Kit (PGK), Increment 1. The USG is contemplating multiple options to achieve best value full and open acquisition and is interested in the respondents feedback on the following courses of action to support a 2QFY16 Production:  1. Development of a qualified production source based on the current PGK Performance Specification PRD Revision 11, January 2011.    Under this course of action the Government will award a proof of principle and qualification contract to more than one contractor; culminating with qualification and down select to production.  The down select would be based on technical performance, qualification and production option pricing.   Total period of performance is expected to be 30 months starting in FY13 for RDTE with Production Options starting in FY16)  Responders are asked to specifically address the integration of the following capabilities to include development and integration of an anti-jam solution for GPS-based guidance and control in jammed environments, including system performance and a description of degradation in terms of jamming-to-GPS signal ratio (in dB), jammer power (in Watts), and distance to jamming source (in kilometers) as jamming levels (power and number of jammers) increase and potential corresponding incremental design solutions to counter multiple jamming sources at multiple jamming levels.   Identify rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) estimates for Non Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs and unit cost differentials for various levels of viable anti-jam solutions within a quantity range of 5,000 to 10,000 units per year.
2. Qualification of a second production source based on the PGK Technical Data Package (TDP).  Under this course of action the Government would provide the TDP.  Potential offerors will 'build to print' with qualification.  The contract would be awarded based on information provided that will be assessed in accordance with the Technical Evaluation Plan (TEP).  Within the TEP the Government will define a standard qualification program including tests, test quantities and timeline.  Total period of performance is expected to be 30 months with Production Options starting in FY16.
3. Qualification of a second production source based on a Leader-Follower strategy.  Under this course of action the Government would provide the TDP.  Potential offerors will 'build to print' with qualification.  Potential offerors would compete to become the Follower to the incumbent Leader. First year (FY16) production contract to be awarded 100% to Follower.  The contract would be awarded based on the TEP.  Incumbent producer will be contracted by the government to be Leader.  Total period of performance is expected to be 26 Months with Production Options starting in FY16.  

Responders shall provide an appropriate Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for each selected COA(s).  ROM for COA 1 shall include pricing associated with providing TDP to the Government with Government Purpose Rights for all aspects of the solution in support of emerging mandates to maintain best value, full and open competition throughout the life cycle of DoD systems. ROM for COAs 2 and 3 shall also include pricing associated with changes to the TDP to maintain Government Purpose Rights.    
ROM for COA 1 shall include as a minimum i) material, ii) labor, iii) three-one year options.  The proposed phased acquisition strategy for COA 1 is as follows: 
-Phase 1:  Technology Demonstration is expected to be approximately twelve (12) months and consists of design maturation.  
-Phase 2:  Completion of Engineering Manufacturing and Development (E&MD) is expected to be approximately eighteen (18) months to complete full qualification manufacturing readiness for a precision guidance kit/fuzing solution. 
Following a Milestone C decision, the Government will make a down select decision, which will include potential Initial Production and Deployment (IP&D) options (1 year per option) for 3 years with quantity range of 5,000 to 10,000 per year. This phase will include Production Verification and a First Article Test.   
ROM for COA 2 shall include as a minimum i) material, ii) labor, iii) three-one year options.  The proposed phased acquisition strategy for COA 2 utilizing the government TDP is as follows: 
-Phase 1:  Technology Maturation is expected to be approximately eighteen (18) months and consists of understanding the TDP, developing tooling and production process, and finalization of the design maturation. 
-Phase 2:  Qualification and Production Readiness is expected to be approximately twelve (12) months to involve initial production representative units and a First Article Test.  
-Phase 3:  There is a potential Initial Production and Deployment (IP&D) that contains three production options (1 year per option) with quantity range of 5,000 to 10,000 per year. 
ROM for COA 3 shall include as a minimum i) material, ii) labor, iii) three-one year options. The proposed phased acquisition strategy for COA 3 utilizing the Government TDP is as follows: 
-Phase 1:  Technology Maturation is expected to be approximately fourteen (14) months and consists of understanding the TDP, developing tooling and production process, and finalization of the design maturation.   
-Phase 2:  With the assistance of the incumbent producer, the Qualification and Production Readiness is expected to be approximately twelve (12) months to involve initial production representative units and a First Article Test.  Successful FAT will result in award of one year production to the Follower.
Potential follow on Production Options will be competed between Leader and Follower.

The FBPAR provide radar surveillance and air traffic control to military and commercial aircraft.  The EPRMS monitor the power status of the FBPAR shelter and site and consistently report the power status of the site backup generator. The power status is then reported to the air traffic control tower (ATCT) through the electronic display screen. The EPRMS indicates in the FBPAR shelter or ATCT whether the FBPAR is operating on normal utility power or the generator is carrying the site load. The Government does not possess specifications and-or detailed drawings for the spares to be procured.  Currently, the said spares are provided by Allen-Bradley and GE FANUC, which are the original manufacturers of the parts. The government does not possess detailed drawings or Specifications for the subject parts.

<DESC>See Statement of work:<br>A summary is provided below:<br><br>1.1 Description of services and introduction: The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, other items, and non-personnel services necessary to perform a training class in an alternate format that educates audiences on domestic violence, its many forms, ways to recognize it and ways to make it stop. This is done theatrically all through irreverent song and dance.  The intent is to explore alternate delivery platforms for presenting information that addresses issues in a way that makes sense to our target audience. <br><br>1.2 Background: Traditional slide presentations have had little to no effect on expressing the severity and importance of domestic violence, Control, and Assault to our audience.  The uses of nontraditional delivery methods to illustrate "real life situations" have recently proved very successful in expressing the themes of domestic violence and other emotionally challenging subjects.  The presentations that we are seeking will educate/train our audience, and will be used to disprove domestic violence myths and educate Soldiers, DA Civilians, and Family members on ways to prevent abusive relationships in lieu of slide presentations. <br><br>1.3 Objectives: The effective delivery of training provides an opportunity to raise awareness of domestic violence, educate about the signs of abuse, and emphasize the negative impact it has on family readiness.  <br><br>1.3.1 Point out common mistakes made by parents and friends in their frustrated attempts to help the victim escape the abuse.<br><br>1.3.2 Bring to light common tactics used by abusers to trap victims into a rigidly controlled relationship. <br><br>1.3.3 Point out to abusers the pain and misery they bring to the lives of others through their actions. <br><br>1.4 Description of services and introduction:   <br><br>Provide two classes with the format discussed above on the following topics: 1) Domestic Violence; 2) Control and Assault. <br><br>Each class will consist of two performances. There will be one performance of each class per day, for two consecutive days per installation. Therefore, there will be four classes of the domestic violence class presented, two per day, for a two day period. There will also be two classes of the Control and Assault class presented one per day, for a two day period.<br><br>These performances will be approximately one-hour musical productions with time for Q&A following the performances.  The contractor will conduct these performances/training sessions at the following locations: <br>	Fort Benning, Georgia (Tentatively June 2012)<br>	Fort Bragg, North Carolina (Tentatively May 2012)<br>	Fort Campbell, Kentucky (Tentatively July 2012)<br>	Fort Carson, Colorado (Tentatively August 2012)<br>	Eglin Air Force Base, Florida (Tentatively October 2012)<br>	Joint Base Lewis McChord, Washington (Tentatively September 2012)<br>	Fort Stewart, Georgia (Tentatively June 2012)<br>

<p>Real Estate Web-Based Building and Market Data Information-Real Time Data</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified companies that are capable of providing real estate web-based services.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a need to procure a web-based service that will provide detailed building and market data throughout the United States and Puerto Rico on a daily real-time data basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide access to an existing web-based database that provides accurate, current and comprehensive data that includes commercial real estate market information for a minimum of fifty (50) markets and sub-markets and which identifies available commercial space, types of space, historical real estate data, vacancy information and /or rates, photographs, maps, floor plans, market data, for major US metropolitan markets and their sub-markets. In order for the database to be useful, it must have a transactional and market history of a minimum of five to ten years. This data must be as current and real-time given the dynamic, subjective nature of real estate information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The data system must have the ability to gather information and make updates through direct field research, including measuring, inspecting and photographing properties. Of equal importance is the ability to enhance the output of the IRS Post-of-Duty Model (i.e., information IRS considers when reviewing and establishing office locations) by determining building inventory via zip codes searches, and by establishing location criteria (i.e., a delineated area). This function requires that the web-based system be compatible with the IRS Post-of-Duty Model system and be able to interact with it (see sample-POD MODEL TERMINOLOGY SHEET attached).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IRS engages in a proprietary location modeling process to determine the optimal location of IRS facilities by zip code designation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the location modeling process, the IRS utilizes Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and will consider the market data output from the procured web-based service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The web-based service shall allow the IRS to search for available commercial building inventory by zip code.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, property searches shall be conducted by overlaying a set of boundaries onto a map or aerial image in the web-based service database, which shall provide available commercial building inventory within that delineated area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be sixteen (16) IRS users located nationwide, with the potential to add additional users throughout the term of the contract for additional fees. The web-based service shall allow IRS users the ability to analyze current and historical market conditions, verify building specific lease terms and conditions, asking rental rates, building vacancy rates, available square footage by floor, building class, up-to-date subject building transactions, building specific images, floor plans, exterior and interior building photos and new construction information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All information presented shall be daily real-time data. The NAICS code is 518210.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The contractor shall provide a minimum of one (1) day of on-site training to ensure IRS users understand the web-based product's capability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall provide ongoing customer support for the term of the contract to answer questions/troubleshoot, and to notify IRS of all system upgrades and new market data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This shall be achieved via online demonstrations or contractor staffed call sites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Customer service support shall be available to the IRS Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Interested parties that can provide the above requirement shall submit clear and convincing evidence, a written capability statement and provide trial access to their database with the submission of their written capability statement. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Respondents are advised not to include any confidential business information with their response as the Government does not guarantee confidentiality of the information received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No award will be made on the basis of this sources sought request.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No quotes or pricing shall be submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. </span></p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
<p>The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible businesses concerns under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences with Business Size Standards in number of employees 500.</p>
<p>The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Social &amp; Behavioral Research Branch (SDRB) in partnership with the Mossy Foot Treatment and Prevention Association (MFTPA) in Ethiopia, has conducted formative research to support the development and delivery of prevention and education intervention to address the problem of podoconiosis in the Wolaita region of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The Contractor in conjunction with the Government will conduct activities in two of the original communities that participated in the qualitative data collection part (Phase 1) of the project. These communities are Gununo and Kercheche, located at 25km and 50km from Sodo town, which is a small town and home of the Mossy Foot Treatment &amp; Prevention Association, our NGO partner in this endeavor. These activities will include about 30 individuals at each site. The target audiences we will be approaching include: parents of high risk children, farmers, local agricultural organization employees, MFTPA lay health workers, religious leaders, local disc jockeys, and high risk children. We are not conducting evaluation activities in the two other pilot communities (i.e., Gesuba and Hobicha) as our initial qualitative activities indicated relatively consistent findings among the four sites.</p>
<p>The intervention will be directed to two priority target groups: 1) Children aged 7-15 at high risk for podoconiosis (child is a first or second degree blood relative of an individual with podoconiosis who is receiving services from the MFTPA), and 2) Parents and primary caregivers of high risk children aged 7-15. The lower end of the age range was selected because 7 is an age at which many children in the community are eligible to attend school and thus, allows intervention activities to capitalize on this transition to motivate shoe wearing. Seven years is also an age at which foot growth begins to stabilize thus necessitating fewer shoe replacements (allowing for shoes to be worn longer). The upper end of the age range was chosen because it marks the transition to early adulthood when marriage and child-bearing become possible. However, pre-testing may suggest adjustments or expansions in the age range. Both children and parents were chosen because prior research consistently shows that attitudes, beliefs, and practices of both groups have powerful influences on the behavior of the children.</p>
<p>In addition to the two priority populations, intervention activities also will include lay health advisors (LHAs; individuals within the community who are conveyors of information and support), community gate keepers such as church elders, and MFTPA workers. The intervention will engage these secondary groups with the objective of bolstering credibility of the intervention within the priority target groups and fostering appropriate role modeling.</p>
<p>Intervention design and content are primarily aligned with the Socio-Ecological Model. This model assumes a holistic approach in which individual (knowledge, attitudes, skills), interpersonal (family and others), organizational (institutions and organizations), community (organizational relationships), and policy aspects are jointly considered in addressing a health problem.</p>
<p><strong>The primary behaviors being addressed by the intervention include:<br /><br /></strong>&bull; children failing to wear shoes while working in the fields, <br />&bull; children failing to wear shoes around the house and while playing, <br />&bull; children preserving shoes by wearing them irregularly, <br />&bull; parents forgoing shoe purchase or attainment,<br />&bull; parents discouraging or failing to encourage shoe wearing by their children, and <br />&bull; parents failing to help children maintain proper foot hygiene.</p>
<p><strong>The intervention will revolve around promoting and supporting a series of messages intended to change attitudes and behaviors. Key messages include:<br /><br /></strong>&bull; Shoes are a part of keeping children healthy and ensuring their success in life. <br />&bull; Proper foot hygiene is a part of keeping children healthy.<br />&bull; You/your children is/are at risk for podoconiosis.<br />&bull; Shoes protect from podoconiosis and other health problems.<br />&bull; Shoes should be worn at all times.<br />&bull; Shoes are a part of ordinary and proper dress.<br />&bull; Shoes can be obtained for very little expense (combined with educational information about acquiring shoes through the MFPTA).</p>
<p><strong>Specific intervention components are to be determined, but preliminary qualitative research suggests the following types of components have promise:<br /><br /></strong>&bull; Training of lay helpers in delivery of key intervention messages, and providing lay helpers with materials to support messaging.<br />&bull; Promotion of a song about foot protection and shoes.<br />&bull; Delivery of radio-based messaging in the form of PSAs, songs, and dramatic stories.<br />&bull; Dissemination of posters in locations where behaviors are most important and salient (farming areas, playing areas, water fetching areas, etc.).<br />&bull; Education of community leaders through one-on-one efforts of MFTPA or other "experts."<br />&bull; Training of MFTPA worker to provide standardized oral education content, and providing MFTPA workers with materials to support discussion and demonstration</p>
<p>The intervention aims to build on and develop the health promotion and education currently offered by the MFTPA during shoe distribution, so that the benefits of shoe wearing are maximized in this group of high risk children. The messages to be used will reinforce those already disseminated through MFTPA, yet the channels used will take them further into the community, increasing the impact the MFTPA has in prevention of disease and reduction of stigma.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Planned Rapid Assessment Evaluation Activities:</span></strong></p>
<p>The specific objective of this requirement is to conduct a rapid assessment evaluation (RAE) of these initial intervention activities on site in the Wolaita zone, Ethiopia, beginning in spring, 2012. The REA is an approach commonly used in international health promotion to "test drive" intervention activities with the target audience in real time and gain insights from participants on changes that could increase the effectiveness of the intervention. The RAE activities will be conducted based on the approved protocol, 10-HG-N142 "Promoting Consistent Shoe Use among Children at Risk for Podoconiosis."</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The planned RAE will involve the following four (4) activities</span></strong>:</p>
<p>(1) Assessment of the target audiences' responses to the mock-ups of posters, public service announcements (prepared for local radio stations), song lyrics and melody via focus groups and structured interviews. The target audience for this activity will include 6-10 individuals from various social groups, such as community/church leaders, recovered patients who are receiving vocational training from MFTPA, LHAs (MFTPA workers, local health workers and others who are associated with podoconiosis-related work), and natural helpers (individuals who already play a key role providing information in the community, church women's groups, lay leaders from a church/community);</p>
<p>(2) Presenting a proposed set of training modules to Lay Health Advisors to assess whether key messages are understood and credible, and test length and engagement with the training activities;</p>
<p>(3) Observation of local parents and lay health workers using the training materials in "quick educational sessions" conducted with volunteer model high risk families; and</p>
<p>(4) Assessment of the feasibility of a "foot profile" assessment to gauge changes in foot condition before and after periods of shoe wearing among high risk children. Data will be collected from 170 children at the local school, and each child will be assessed by two (2) separate assessors.</p>
<p>The contractor, along with the NIH research team, will conduct these activities in two of the original communities that participated in the qualitative data collection part (Phase 1) of the project. RAE activities will include about 30 individuals at each of the two sites. The target audiences we will be approaching include: parents of high risk children, farmers, local agricultural organization employees, MFTPA lay health workers, religious leaders, local disc jockeys, and high risk children.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the REA, the contractor and the research team will convene while in the Wolaita zone to consider the need for adjustments in the intervention activities. A summary of changes will be prepared by the research team and presented to the MFTPA as well as a select group of members of the target audience to collect a second round of responses to proposed revisions in intervention approaches.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide scientific oversight on collection of qualitative data collection, and the development of culturally-tailored intervention approaches and materials. Expertise in the epidemiology of podoconiosis and experience in conducting qualitative research in the Wolaita region of Ethiopia continues to be essential to ensure the development of culturally appropriate intervention materials. In addition,extensive experience as a physician and epidemiologist who has lived and collaborated with the local communities and the Mossy Foot Treatment and Prevention Association is invaluable given the proposed intervention activities will take place in Wolaita, Ethiopia where research is being conducted. The Contractor's involvement will enable NHGRI to accomplish a more rigorously designed study that will greatly improve the likelihood that the results will be published in a high impact journal.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize yourself with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk. Interested parties should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above and in the attached draft statement of work. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Statements should also include an indication of current business size status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement. Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>All capability Statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Dorothy Maxwell, Contract Specialist, at maxwelld@mail.nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), May 16, 2012 7:30 AM, EST.

<SUBJECT>Upgrade of the Central Alarm Station (CAS) 
<SOLNBR>APP-12-7134
<RESPDATE>051512
<CONTACT>Carol Greenwood, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-492-3694, Fax 301-492-3438, Email Carol.Greenwood@nrc.gov - Heriberto (Eddie) Colon, Jr., Sr. Contract Specialist, Phone 301-492-3620, Fax 301-492-3437, Email heriberto.colon@nrc.gov
<DESC><p>RFI for Upgrade or Replacement of Central Alarm Station (CAS) <br />APP-12-7134</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) seeks information from industry for a future upgrade to the agency's Central Alarm Station (CAS). The information that NRC gathers from this RFI and related market research is for planning purposes only and may be used to assist the NRC in planning an acquisition strategy if an upgrade or replacement acquisition for NRC's CAS is deemed appropriate by NRC.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The NRC CAS has been operating for several years with minor and partial upgrades to the existing security equipment, systems, and components. Through time, newer equipment and technology has been added to legacy equipment creating incompatibility issues and decreasing the CAS' capabilities as an efficient user-friendly management and monitoring station. For example, the functions of access control, intrusion detection and video surveillance are all segregated forcing alarm station operators (ASOs) to monitor and control numerous workstations (areas) delaying assessment times and in some cases response times. The addition of a new building (3 White Flint Complex) provides an even greater need to upgrade the existing CAS in order to ensure integration of all security systems (i.e., access control, intrusion detection and video surveillance) from all buildings creating a flexible and more efficient management and monitoring system that will benefit the physical security program for the next several years. The NRC CAS' current security system configuration consists of the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Access Control System: Consists of a global server and several Regional servers operating GE Security's Facility Commander.</p>
<p>&bull; Intrusion Detection System: Consists of a Bosch 6600 receiver for local alarm monitoring. In addition, NRC utilizes Federal Protective Services for remote monitoring capabilities and requires certain rooms/areas to be UL 2050 certified.</p>
<p>&bull; Video Surveillance System: Consists of a partial analog camera system utilizing digital video recorders and a partial Internet Protocol camera based system utilizing network video recorders, none of which are integrated with the IDS or ACS.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS</p>
<p>1. Provide detailed commercial literature or other readily available information about current commercial item solutions that NRC should consider in upgrading or replacing the aforementioned GE-based CAS. Include make, model, and commercial list price information (but not a proposal or quotation) for those products and indicate their compatibility with the aforementioned GE-based CAS components. Also, provide detailed information regarding extent to which these products comply with applicable Section 508 standards (see www.section508.gov).</p>
<p>2. Is your organization an authorized reseller/business partner for GE information technology (IT) security solutions? If so, then please indicate what those solutions are and provide commercial price list(s) or range of prices for those commercial item offerings, both for products and related services. Please also indicate if any products discussed in your response are available on any existing GSA contracts and if so, please provide the GSA contract numbers.</p>
<p>3. Please describe your organization's status with respect to NAICS 541519 (150 employee size standard) (e. g., other than small business, small business, woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business).</p>
<p>4. Describe your organization's experience over the past five years as a prime contractor providing and integrating a commercial item application of GE IT security solutions such as Facility Commander Wnx (FCWnx) in a Microsoft Windows environment for the integration of access control, intrusion detection and video surveillance into a central monitoring station. Also, please address your organization's experience with the GE FCWNx (Global Edition) multi-server system. Please indicate the scope (in detail), complexity, dollar value and period of performance for GE IT security solutions provided by your organization over the past 5 years as prime contractor, and provide the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses for customer points of contact for these projects that are familiar with your organization's work on those projects.</p>
<p>5. Describe your organization's experience within the past five years using the "C Language" interfaced with GE FCWnx, to include the complete configuration of an integrated access control, intrusion detection and video surveillance system.</p>
<p>6. Please describe your organization's experience centralizing and consolidating a central alarm station into a monitoring station with LED display panels and integrating other associated security equipment and systems, including but not limited to the integration of access control, intrusion detection and video surveillance. How would you show us what is the latest proven most up-to-date technology in access control, intrusion detection and video surveillance systems?</p>
<p>7. Describe your organization's experience providing operations and maintenance for GE IT security solutions (e.g., monitoring, trouble-shooting, emergency response, preventive maintenance).</p>
<p>8. Describe your organization's experience complying, or providing compliant solutions for federal agencies, for the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and NIST SP800-53 requirements for building security systems (e.g., security plans, contingency plans, risk management, patch management, and continuous monitoring).</p>
<p>9. Describe, in detail, your organization's experience with configuration change management and patch management on security systems and utilization of related performance metrics.</p>
<p><br />Please describe your organization's experience addressing integration of power supply requirements with a new GE IT security solution.<br /><br /><br />Please e-mail your responses to Carol Greenwood at <a href="mailto:Carol.Greenwood@nrc.gov">Carol.Greenwood@nrc.gov</a> by the stated response date deadline.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, "Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes" This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
Purpose
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Environmental Programs Service (EPS) Industrial Hygiene Program is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement of a web-based healthcare specific waste management and recycling tracking system service from a commercial provider. The services shall include storage and security capabilities.  The intent is to replace the current VHA data collection system. The solution shall be an integrated tool set through which the VHA monitors performance metrics and manage through roles and process rather than physical control of assets. The government believes that traditional outsourcing and system integration support is insufficiently adaptive and costly and should be replaced by commodity services.
This Sources Sought announcement describes the goals that VHA requires with regard to the
1.	modernization of its health care-specific data collection system; 
2.	provision of an effective collaborative working environment;
3.	reduction of the government's in-house system maintenance burden by providing related business, technical, and management functions; and
4.	application of appropriate security and privacy safeguards. 
The new data collection and collaboration system will meet STET  performance standards, offer the necessary redundancy and contingency features to meet VHA's needs, and provide technology enhancements to improve user experience and minimize service disruption.  The solution shall involve no software development work and minimal integration effort past implementation.  The cost of operation will also be significantly reduced.
Because this is a Sources Sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  No solicitation exists. Therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business, SDVOSB, VOSB or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 applies to this procurement.
Background
The 2010 federal budget released by the administration and published on May 11, 2009 calls for improving innovation, efficiency and effectiveness in federal information technology (IT). The White House recommends that agencies adopt innovations and implement projects that increase efficiencies by optimizing common services and solutions across the enterprise and utilizing market innovations such as Cloud Computing services.  Executive Order (EO); 13514- Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance, and Executive Order (EO); 13423- Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management requirements necessitate that VHA find more innovative ways to implement pollution prevention and waste diversion programs that target hospital specific wastes and toxic chemicals to improve our  reduction efforts. EO 13514 sets specific goals for "minimizing the generation of waste and pollutants through source reduction; diverting at least 50 percent of non-hazardous solid waste, excluding construction and demolition debris, by the end of fiscal year 2015; diverting at least 50 percent of construction and demolition materials and debris by the end of fiscal year 2015.  The current possibilities and value in sorting, sharing, and networking collective information can be enhanced by commercially available services.  
The existing data collection and collaboration infrastructures at the VHA are not adequate for the future. They consist of servers utilizing URLs with limited storage capacitates, limited redundancy, high level technical support, and inconsistent archiving capability. In addition, the current data collection infrastructure makes it difficult to manage and retrieve data associated with diversion rates, and budget.  In-house upgrading, replacement, and deployment of new servers and infrastructure are both expensive and disruptive to VHA operations.  Therefore, in an effort to improve performance, enhance redundancy, facilitate legal compliance, and manage cost, the VHA EPS conducted market research to evaluate the viability and cost of various options, and is now pursuing this acquisition.  This approach is expected to realize savings in cost and resources while providing the services needed to make VHA more efficient and effective. 
The current data collection and collaboration software infrastructure supporting the VHA in multiple domain names is based on:
IBM Lotus Notes (version 7.0.3) for e-mail support and uses,
IBM Lotus Domino (version 7.0.4, 8.0.1) for database support,
IBM Lotus Domino (version 8.02),
IBM Lotus Connections (version 2.5), 
IBM Lotus Sametime (version 8.02),
IBM Lotus Sametime Gateway (version 8.02)
IBM Lotus Quickr (version 8.2) in the collaborative environment, and
IBM DB2 CommonStore for Lotus Domino (CSLD)  (version 8.3) for the litigation hold 	archiving (under 1 TB currently, growing at 2GB/day).
Blackberry Enterprise Server (version 4.1.7), and
PGP Encryption (version 9.10) for desktop client encryption.

VHA currently has 152 VA Medical Center sites with approximately 456 users (individual and groups) in the catalog.

The current VHA waste minimization and compliance Report data collection system requires the creation of a URL which is generated annually and does not have the capability to roll over previous year's data.

      In addition, VHA has the option to utilize the following capabilities:

            Cisco MeetingPlace 7.0
            Cisco Unified Presence Server 7.0.6
            Cicso IP Communicator 7.0.3
            Cisco Unified Personal Communicator 7.0.2
            Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.1.3
            Cisco Unified Mobile Communicator Blackberry Client
            
A list of standard software approved for use within VHA is provided as Attachment 4 VHA Approved Standard Software.
The hardware infrastructure of data collection system is aging (5+ years) and deployment of new servers.  The current infrastructure is site specific.  For example, each of the 157 locations (in the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Manila) has its own set of servers.  Further, if a regional location has power issues or becomes unusable, access to URL is lost for users at that location.   
URL via e-mail archiving is currently implemented inconsistently, is difficult to use, and does not meet information retrieval (e-discovery) requirements.  Additionally, the storage associated with URL via e-mail archiving continues to grow and is costly to manage.  Recent regulations for handling e-mail litigation hold and discovery demand that VHA implement a more effective and expedient process.  
Data collection process has evolved over the years into an integrated data collection and collaborative environment.  VHA's current environment lacks the level of integrated features that is commercially available.  VHA requires a greater use of these integrated data collection and collaborative tools to support its mission and critical position within the federal government.  Additionally, VHA is seeking a solution that will reduce the government's in-house system maintenance burden and provide VHA users with more timely implementations of new versions and features.  
VHA will maintain customer (user) support to trouble calls or requests for assistance and interface with the appropriate technical support.  No direct customer support is required from this solicitation.  Only technical and system administration staff will interface directly with the Offeror.
Scope
The scope of the resulting contract will include all computing and support services required to transition, deploy, operate, maintain, and safeguard an enterprise-wide- data collection and collaboration environment.
Period of Performance
The base period of performance is for three years from contract award with four, one-year options.

<p>A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR COMMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED USE OF A DETERMINATION OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES (DEC) for the Preclinical Drug Development Services for the NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)  

SUMMARY: The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is seeking public comment on a proposed use of a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC), as provided for under the Bayh-Dole Act, for its Preclinical Drug Development Services Program.

BACKGROUND: To carry out the NIH mission of promoting Science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability, the NCATS organizationally located within NIH conducts translational research in the area of human therapeutics development. 

The NCATS Division of Pre-clinical Innovation (DPI) aims to help bridge the gap in investment in early development phases for new drugs to help patient populations with unmet medical needs. Currently, NCATS DPI has two programs, the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program and the Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) program, to assist academic scientists, non-profit organizations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies working on developing novel therapies for unmet medical needs.  NCATS may create additional programs needing pre-clinical drug developments services in the future. 

Through the BrIDGs program (formerly the NIH RAID Program), NIH makes available, on a competitive basis, certain critical resources needed for the development of new therapeutic agents. It is intended to advance promising therapies into the clinic by providing in-kind services to overcome late stage preclinical therapy development obstacles. 

The TRND programs goal is to encourage and speed the development of new drugs for rare and neglected tropical diseases. This program is specifically intended to stimulate drug discovery and development research collaborations between NIH and academic scientists, non-profit organizations, and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies working on rare and neglected illnesses.  The TRND program provides an opportunity to partner with and gain access to rare and neglected tropical disease drug development capabilities, expertise, and clinical/regulatory resources in a collaborative environment with the goal of moving promising therapeutics into human clinical trials. TRND uses an application and evaluation process to select collaborators. Selected TRND collaborators/contributors will provide their proprietary drugs, drug manufacturing process and development platforms and disease expertise throughout the project.  NCATS through its internal resource, contracts and subcontracts will provide screening, lead optimization, preclinical development and product development of a contributors proprietary Materials, as needed.

NCATS experience has shown that many owners of candidate Material and/or Technology, particularly in the commercial sector, will refuse to submit their Material and/or Technology for screening, lead optimization, preclinical development and product development where there is a risk that Government contractors will obtain rights to Subject Inventions relating to the Material and/or Technology.  Material and/or Technology owners have argued forcefully that the risk of losing rights in patents that would effectively block the commercialization of their own proprietary Material and/or Technology, in which they have invested considerable resources to develop and upon which their very viability as a business is dependent, is not acceptable.

The projects undertaken by the TRND and BrIDGs Programs will most likely generate new inventions. The Bayh-Dole Act establishes the rights and obligations of grantees and contractors to Subject Inventions-inventions that are conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement by the Federal Government. One of the goals of the Bayh-Dole Act is to incentivize the commercialization of Government-supported Subject Inventions. Under the Bayh-Dole Act, Government contractors generally retain the right to elect title to inventions made by its researchers as a result of their work performed under a Government-supported agreement.  A Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) to the Bayh-Dole Act directs ownership of inventions made by the funding recipient to the Government or other party. Thus, without a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances, the NCATS contracted medicinal chemists, screening facilities, contract research organizations and other services would retain the right to elect title/ownership of inventions to all new proprietary therapeutics intellectual property that they develop under an agreement with NCATS.

In order to ensure those pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, small businesses, academic institutions, and others will collaborate with NCATS in order to help in identifying, testing, developing, and commercializing new therapeutics, diagnostics, prognostics and prophylactic measures against human diseases, NCATS has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as described above, and that the Contractors and subcontractors rights (at all tiers) in subject inventions should be limited accordingly.  Because the TRND and BrIDGs Programs will be helping move a Providers proprietary intellectual property, including Materials and Methods through the drug development pipeline, this DEC will better ensure Providers ability to promote the commercialization and therefore public availability of these inventions without unduly encumbering future research and discovery by the contractor.

Discussions with potential TRND and BrIDGs Contributors and Contractors suggest that allowing the Contractors to retain ownership to any newly developed proprietary therapeutics intellectual property would actually impede the further development and commercialization of new drugs. In order to develop good lead therapeutics, the TRND and BrIDGs Program must attract promising, high quality drug development projects including starting therapeutics. Potential Contributors have consistently informed NCATS that they would participate in TRND and BrIDGs only if they could be assured full ownership of patent rights to all analogs generated from their starting therapeutics as well as any novel processes to scale up the therapeutics. 

PROPOSED IP STRATEGY: For the Preclinical Drug Development Services Program, the NCATS is considering a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC), as provided for under the Bayh-Dole Act. The DEC would cover two classes of Subject Inventions:

Class 1:  Subject Inventions that require the use of, improve, or incorporate any Material and Subject Inventions that are methods of manufacturing or synthesis of a Material.  If the Contributor declines offer of assignment, then NCATS may dispose of the invention rights as NCATS determines would be in the best interests of the program and public health (e.g., allow Contractor to retain invention rights).

Class 2:  Subject Inventions that do not fall into Class 1 above.   
Rights to all other Subject Inventions will be retained by the Contractor pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act.

RESPONSES: The NCATS invites comments on this strategy and use of a DEC for the Preclinical Drug Development Services Program. Alternative strategies that will support the development and encourage the contribution of novel therapeutics to the program will be considered before a final determination is made regarding the use of a DEC.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, Eastern Region Acquisition Division-KC and the National Weather Service (NWS) is awarding and purchase order for (50) each, Printed Circuit Board, for repair of the Vaisala ice Free Wind Sensor Power Supply. Vaisala is the company that designed and built all of the Ice Free Wind Sensors, including all of its components. They retain the only source for this repair part and the drawings for the end product. Vaisala also retains the engineers and technicians who designed the power supply, thus reducing the time to manufacture the item. This item is proprietary to Vaisala. Any other manufacturer's part would not work due to the uniqueness of the end item being replaced. The Government does not have the design rights of the manufacturer drawings for this part. Any attempt to reproduce this item from any other source other than Vaisala, would require that the Government re-qualify the part at considerable cost to the government and any cost savings could not recovered using open competition. A sources sought was posted on FedBizOpps under NWWA12001250627KLC on April 12, 2012 for a 5-day posting that resulted in no responses to the notice.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a non-competitive indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity type contract with the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) for the project entitled, "Spacer Grid Thermal-Hydraulics Program" (SGTH). The proposed period of performance for this contract is five years (a 2-year base period with three 1-year option periods). <br />
<p><br />The statutory authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (b)(1), which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the services are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy NRC's requirements.</p>
<p>The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code NAICS Code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to: (1) obtain experimental data for prototype mixing vane spacer grid for a range of steam flow so the droplet break up mechanism and effect of spacer grid on drop size can be examined; (2) design and manufacture a new test apparatus that is suitable for high temperature reflood test and quick change of various types of spacer grids; (3) develop heat transfer model and correlations for the data generated from previous reflood, interfacial drag and steam cooling tests; (4) develop interfacial area transport model and correlations from data generated in these same series of tests; and (5) create a pilot version of TRACE code with the new models implemented and benchmark against the test series parameters.</p>
<p>To accomplish the above stated objectives for this project, the contractor must have: (1) detailed knowledge of two-phase flow theory and experimental techniques; (2) demonstrated experience and expertise in multi-phase instrumentation and measurement skills; and (3) a unique test facility which models the full length reactor core and downcomer that has the capability to supply pressurized steam and high temperature rod bundle that simulated reflood conditions.</p>
<p>The NRC posted Sources Sought Synopsis No. RES-10-Spacer-Grid on the Federal Business Opportunities website (<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NRC/OA/DCPM/RES-10-Spacer-Grid/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NRC/OA/DCPM/RES-10-Spacer-Grid/listing.html</a>) to conduct a market survey and analysis to determine the range of available contractors that exist and to assess their capabilities to assist the NRC with Spacer Grid Thermal-Hydraulic Program. The synopsis required interested parties to provide a capability statement that demonstrated their organization had the required expertise, experience, and test facility as stated in paragraph 4 above. The NRC evaluated the responses received for Sources Sought Synopsis No. RES-10-Spacer-Grid and determined that the only source with the required expertise, experience, and facility to perform this work is PSU. Specifically, it was determined that Dr. F. B. Cheung, a Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Nuclear Engineering at PSU, and Dr. Seungjin Kim, a respected thermal-hydraulic expert in two phase flow phenomena, both have the required expertise and experience to meet NRC's requirements. Located at PSU is the Rod Bundle Heat Transfer (RBHT) test facility, which meets all of NRC test facility requirements. Specifically, the RBHT facility models the full length reactor core and downcomer and has the capability to supply pressurized steam and high temperature rod bundle to simulate reflood conditions. In summary, PSU is the only organization that posses the required expertise, experience, and facility to accomplish the objectives of this project.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. Request for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Jennifer A. DeFino, Sr. Contract Specialist via e-mail at <a href="mailto:Jennifer.DeFino@nrc.gov">Jennifer.DeFino@nrc.gov</a> no later than May 17, 2012 (i.e. 15 calendar days from the date this announcement was posted).

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>REQUIREMENT: Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Network Services for<br />Defense Information System Network (DISN)<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DISA DOES NOT PRESENTLY INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.<br />Purpose:<br />To obtain industry capabilities information for acquisition planning purposes.</p>
<p>DISA is initiating the acquisition activities that will result in the replacement of the DISN Access Transport Services (DATS), Defense Information System Network Transmission (DISN) Services - Pacific (DTS-P), Joint Hawaii Information Technology Services (JHITS), and significantly reduce our use of Networx and Bulletin Board for circuit services. DISA is considering consolidating those contracts into a single contract - Global Network Services (GNS).</p>
<p>The scope of the GNS contract is global, SLA-based, commercially leased, media independent network capacity services (from short term leases to Indefeasible Rights of Use, and all current and future telecommunications networks data transfer rates and standards/protocols) for the DoD, its Services and Agencies and other Federal Departments anywhere worldwide in order to satisfy defense-related (includes supports of contingency operations at all levels) national security telecommunications and networking requirements. In conjunction with these telecommunication services, the scope also includes installation of equipment and associated services to support the enclave, and the transition of circuits on current contracts to the winning vendors of the GNS contract.</p>
<p>How To Respond:<br />This RFI is NOT for market research. Please do not respond with company information and/or solutions. DISA's intent is to collaboratively write, Government and industry together, the capabilities the GNS contract should acquire.</p>
<p>DISA requests industry review and provide recommended revisions and comments on its proposed Capability Needs Document (CND) for the Global Network Services (GNS) acquisition in accordance with the "Exchanges with industry before receipt of proposals" best practices as contained in FAR Part 15.201. Responses can be provided though two methods. One is to provide a response directly to the contracting officer. The other is to review and make proposed changes to a draft version of the GNS CND that is available on All Partners Access Network (APAN). Our preference is for industry comments to be received via APAN.</p>
<p>Our goal in using this social media tool is to allow for a more collaborative and agile method of getting industry comments. In order to limit the number of contributors to a manageable number, only one account will be authorized per company. <br />To request editing access, follow these instructions: <br />1. Create a free APAN account. https://passport.apan.org/passport/join.aspx<br />a. Enter your organization name into your profile. Access will NOT be granted if this is blank.<br />2. Access the GNS CND here:<br />https://community.apan.org/gns/default.aspx<br />3. If the Request Membership box does not automatically appear, click on the group title. Enter text on why you want to be granted access.<br />4. The Government group owner receives an email regarding your request and checks the organization info in the profile. If it is an actual company, access will be granted.<br />The Government will restrict write access to any individual whose actions are deemed to be disruptive, see the Rules and Code of Conduct below. This termination of write access will in no way limit the ability of that firm to continue to provide input via written input to the Contracting Officer during the editing period.<br />NOTE: This is not a "sources sought" RFI. Rather the purpose of this RFI is to allow exchanges between industry and Government customers and users to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities.<br />Response Deadline:<br />The Government may place other documents and reference material on APAN, as well as post discussion questions in the forum.<br />The CND wiki will be editable for 30 days, starting the day of this announcement. Afterward, the wiki will be frozen against additional changes. It may also be placed on other social media outlets. The APAN forums and other applications will remain open. Members will continue to be added after the editing period is complete.<br />Special Considerations:<br />The DISN PMO retains ownership of the CND. At any time, the DISN PMO can delete or edit content added by industry, or request expansion or clarification of what is written. Industry can ask the DISN PMO questions by:<br />1) Asking in the forum section of the working group<br />2) by sending an email to the Contracting Officer. <br />Our preference is for comments to be handled in the forums.</p>
<p>Rules<br />1. Debates will be conducted in the forum. <br />2. For ongoing debates, or debates that do not end in a consensus, the Government group owner will make the final decision and end the debate.<br />3. Do not email or call the group owner with questions or clarifications. The group owner will not respond to private questions.<br />Code of Conduct<br />The Government reserves the right to remove permissions for the grounds listed below.<br />1. Debate is encouraged, but language must remain civil. Ad hominem attacks, disparaging remarks, disrespect, vulgarity, profanity, threats, and harassment will not be tolerated. <br />2. No spamming. If other editors or the Government strike your content, do not keep replacing it. Debate is encouraged instead.<br />3. No advertising, promotional materials, junk emails, or pyramid schemes.<br />4. Discussing subjects not related to the GNS scope. For example, political commentary or opinions about organizations or companies.<br />5. Impersonating or misrepresenting your identity or company.<br />6. Violating existing copyright, patent, trademark, or other proprietary rights</p>

DESCRIPTION Commander Naval Sea Systems Command (COMNAVSEASYSCOM) requires a new FrequencyDivision Multiple Access (FDMA), land mobile radio (LMR) system to provideforce protection, damage control, and flight deck wireless communicationsonboard US Navy ships.
 Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic (SPAWARSYSCEN LANT), acting asthe AN/SRC-55 Project Manager/Engineering Office was tasked by NAVSEA toprocure this system.  The current AN/SRC-55 HYDRA System is a modified, commercial off-the-shelf(COTS) trunked FDMA LMR system manufactured by Harris Corporation in Lynchburg,VA. This system operates on a proprietary Harris Enhanced Digital AccessCommunication System (EDACS) air interface scheduled to be discontinued andreplaced with the APCO-25 common air interface (CAI) starting in 2014.
  This specification was developed to articulate and document the requirementsfor shipboard implementation of an APCO-25 LMR system to provide forceprotection, damage control and flight deck communications. It is being sent toindustry in order to solicit feedback concerning the content and scope ofrequirements contained therein and to thence modify the specification asnecessary based on that feedback.
  Shipboard requirements include MIL-S-901D, Grade A & B, Class II shock andMIL-STD-167 vibration characteristics, MIL-STD-461 electromagnetic interference(EMI) and MIL-STD-464 EMI requirements, MIL-STD-810 environmental requirements.All fixed equipment is designed to meet MIL-S-901 Grade B shock, be FMIntrinsically Safe Certified, and are compliant with ship's electrical power.
  System specific unique requirements include low power handheld radios(20mW/100mW), 380-399.9 MHz, and system ERP not greater than 200 mW. There arethree system RF outputs - one mast/external antenna feed and two radiatingtransmission line (RTL) antenna feeds for internal ship communications. Thesystem uses common transmit and receive antennas. Also required is flight deckruthless preemption (includes 5MC override and 4 levels of talk grouppreemption), interface with the 5MC announcing system and ship's telephonenetwork, a VHF/UHF cross-band repeating device referred to as a "linker" tosupport well deck and small watercraft operations. Special purpose subscriberequipment also includes integrated flight deck cranial/headsets that weredesigned to operate in noise fields produced by combat aircraft. Additionally,fixed mobile radios are located through-out the ship to provide location-basedwireless communications capabilities. 24 position battery chargers are requiredto support flight deck communications.
 The AN/SRC-55 must meet DOD IA requirements and hence must be certified andaccredited using the DOD Information Assurance Certification and AccreditationProcess (DIACAP) as specified by DOD INST 8510.01 of November 28, 2007.  Inaddition, DOD requires the use of FIPS 197 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)encryption certified in accordance with FIPS 140-2 in all new DOD LMR systems.
The information below provides a list of certification requirements.

<DESC>This is a sole source announcement.  No solicitation will be prepared or madeavailable.  The  Tactical Systems Engineering Branch (Code 53521) of the Spaceand Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific (SPAWAR SSC Pacific) intends to issuea sole source, firm fixed price contract to ViaSat Inc., 6155 El Camino Real,Carlsbad, CA 92009 for the fulfillment of the Governments requirement for two(2) ViaSat Small Tactical Terminals (STT) and related equipment which enabledual-channel, software defined, networking communications system, hosting theLink-16 and Soldier Radiowaveforms with size, weight, and power limitationsthat allow integration into various rotary wing aircraft. This equipment isrequired to support the the Airborne Maritime Fixed Joint Tactical Radio System(AMF JTRS) program, ajoint Air Force, Navy, and Army effort to develop softwaredefined radios that are interoperable using different waveforms.Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) andFAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements.The success of government testing of the AMF JTRS program is dependent onhaving real terminals that have been, or are going to be fielded on liveplatforms. The AMF program high-level requirements include a dual-channel,software defined, networking communications system, hosting the Link-16 andSoldier Radio waveforms with size, weight, and power limitations that allowintegration into various rotary wing aircraft. Due to the program's immediateneeds to meet operational platform integration schedules in FY2012, the systemmust also have current NSA approval for operational use.ViaSat is one of the leading tactical communications system developers and isthe only knowndeveloper who can provide an NSA approved terminal that meets the AMF JTRSrequirements.ViaSat STT is being used in both the operational theater and in several testfacilities throughout the nation. ViaSat is the sole manufacturer for the STTand is the only vendor able to deliver an NSA approved small airborne variantof a dual-channel software defined networking communications system hosting theLink-16 and Soldier Radio waveforms.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interestedparties may identify their interest and capability to respond to therequirement or submit proposals.  Information received will normally beconsidered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct acompetitive procurement.  A determination by the Government to compete theproposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within thediscretion of the Government.The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is334220 and the size standard is 750 employees.  The estimated value of theeffort is $362,600.  Questions concerning this sole source contract action maybe directed to Jason H. Thomas at SPAWAR SSC Pacific, 53560 Hull Street, SanDiego, CA 92152-5001; email: jason.h.thomas@navy.milQuestions and/or responses are due by 16 May 2012.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) and Division of State and Local Readiness (DSLR) routinely provides training and technical assistance to state and local project areas using a facilitated, in-person workshops. These include the Public Information and Communication (PIC) course as well as the Mass Antibiotic Dispensing (MAD) and Prep courses.
<p>Part of this training includes having student-attendees design the point of dispensing (POD) layout for POD operations overall and PIC operations in particular (i.e., signage, staff, equipment). This is accomplished using large laminated charts of a simulated POD and indicating the location of tools around and throughout the POD on the diagram.</p>
<p>Such realistic simulations of POD duties are crucial to enable state and local staff better determine areas for improvement. Although this training provides significant value to staff in project areas, it remains difficult to later repeat the exercise activity or share it within the jurisdiction without the charts.</p>
<p>Therefore, the need exists to provide to communications professionals involved in Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) POD planning additional tools to enhance and maintain their skills following the training, in a format they can utilize on their own, outside of a formal training setting.</p>
<p>The DSLR PIC Team already has in place an interactive, online role-playing scenario that enables players to act within a decision-making environment during a public health emergency. This existing tool is the Medical Countermeasure Response Trainer (MCRT).</p>
<p>Of need at this time is a new module within MCRT, an interactive, online, graphic-based platform that will enable PIC planners to virtually build, review, and test various layouts for a POD and to use the results of the testing to enhance their plans.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy.<BR><BR>

DIAPR 2010-14 (October 2010) Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System
	(a)  FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts.  The Department of the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation.  One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15. 
	(b)  The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS.  CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report.  Once the report is processed, it is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past performance as part of a source selection action.
	(c)  We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer with the name, position title, phone number, and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s) for the contract no later than 30 days after award.  Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the Contractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before returning the report to the Assessing Official.  The report information must be protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.
	(d)  When your Contractor Representative(s) (Past Performance Points of Contact) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically-generated email with detailed login instructions.  Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS is available at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/.  The CPARS User Manual, registration for On Line Training for Contractor Representatives, and a practice application may be found at this site.
	(e)  Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the Contracting Officer will complete an interim or final past performance evaluation, and the report will be accessible at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/.  Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the evaluation without comment.  Comments are limited to the space provided in Block 22.  Your comments should focus on objective facts in the Assessing Official's narrative and should provide your views on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance.  In addition to the ratings and supporting narratives, blocks 1 - 17 should be reviewed for accuracy, as these include key fields that will be used by the Government to identify your firm in future source selection actions.  If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating "No comment" in Block 22, and then signing and dating Block 23 of the form.  Without a statement in Block 22, you will be unable to sign and submit the evaluation back to the Government.  If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 30 days, it will automatically be returned to the Government and will be annotated: "The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date).  The contractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment."  Your response is due within 30 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR.
	(f)  The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:
        	(1)  Protect the evaluation as "source selection information."  After review, transmit the evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS.  If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contact the Contracting Officer for instructions.  
	(2)  Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization.  Ensure the evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of your control.
	(3)  Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, preaward surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.
	(g)  If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than seven days following your receipt of the evaluation.  The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or other means during your 30-day review period.
    	(h)  A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.
(14)  The Government intends to award a firm fixed-price order resulting from this solicitation.

The care provided will include: nursing, social work services, occupational or physical therapy, assistance with activities of daily living, activity therapy, case management, nutrition service including meals and transportation.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

The items listed here are provided as a "sampling" of supplies ordered as a basis for price & technical acceptability purposes only. It is not possible at this time to provide a complete list of other items due to that being unknown until a supply rqmnt is identified. Thus, the reason chosen for the "sampling." Please price as a qty of 1, with the knowledge that this base price is the determinant for evaluation/basis for award, and ultimately, for future qty orders. 2) No. This is not possible in this circumstance. A PO will be issued, with a level of funding, to enable quick orders to be placed, rcvd, accepted, an invc submitted, and pymnt rendered against the funding doc. 3) All companies shall indicate TAA-compliance. As this is a law that the gvnmnt can only purchase U.S.-made or designated country end products, companies are considered TAA-compliant if they follow TAA guidelines. That said, contractors shall indicate TAA-compliancy in their response in order to be considered under this solicitation.<BR><BR>Q#1: SOW states send quotes via email, but FedBid Terms state to send quote on their site. Ans#1: Ensure FedBid Terms are met by posting quote on its site. Email to CO as well, along with any other info req'd. Q#2: If items on BOM are not TAA Compliant, possible that Govt would still purchase? Ans#2: As applicable, if BOM include item(s) that fall under TAA-Compliancy guidelines, then the purchase is allowable. As previously stated, TAA Compliance is a law that stipulates that the govmnt can only purchase U.S.-made or designated country end products. If the item comes from a country other than who is under the TAA law, the govmnt can not purchase it.<BR><BR>AP3150 is not a valid number. Want to quote AR3150.  Is that what you are requesting?
Answer: Yes.  AR3150, as it applies to the equipment rack 750mm x 1070mm.<BR><BR>On THIS project, I need to know on Line item number 2, for the PDU, what plug and outlets are needed?
Answer:  AP8641 for the PDU.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Solicitation Number:<br>W911QY-11-R-0067<br><br>Notice Type:<br>Presolicitaion<br><br>Synopsis:<br>8/30/2011<br><br>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on behalf of Product Management-Force Protection Systems (PdM-FPS) has a requirement for Full Rate (FRP) production of the Lighting Kit Motion Detection (LKMD) program.  LKMD is a small, modular, unattended tactical ground sensor-based early warning system providing early detection and warning of intrusions. LKMD provides enhanced force effectiveness and situational awareness during all types of combat operations or missions. LKMD further enhances force protection by operating as a tactical stand-alone system, a supplemental device for use with other force protection and physical security systems or as part of an integrated layered situational awareness concept. LKMD provides programmable responses of illumination and/or sound, resulting in increased operational reaction time for individuals, teams, squads or platoons. Capable of being programmed and placed into operation quickly, LKMD allows the soldier to remotely program response configurations and is quickly recoverable. The sensor provides a pre-programmed response of audible/silent alarms and sends data to the hand-held remote control, notifying the operator of a detected target. Upon detection of a target entering the specified area, it activates the modules providing a pre-programmed illumination response.  The Contractor shall fabricate and integrate components of LKMD systems, conduct First Article Test (FAT), obtain Government approval for the tested articles, conduct Production Acceptance Test (PAT) and deliver FRP systems to the designated Government location along with any associated equipment, material, firmware and software.  The contractor will be required to provide pricing data to permit evaluation of the economic order quantities based on proposed discounts.  The LKMD contract will be awarded using full and open competition. It will be a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) production contract. The proposed acquisition approach will be for a five-year (two-year base with three (3) one-year option periods) award FFP IDIQ contract valued at approximately $102M for 25,911 production systems and an initial spares package A single award contract is planned, which will further enable life cycle costs, schedule and performance management efficiency. LKMD procurement FY12-16 is the focus for this requirement.  The Government estimates that proposals shall be due not later than 2:00p.m. on 31 October 2011. Any questions about this requirement must be submitted in writing to Constance Aviles at connie.aviles@us.army.mil.  All proposals shall be sent to the address specified in the solicitation.

<DESC><strong>*******Amendment 1 Posted 5/2/2012*******<br />Answers to Questions posted.<br />*********</strong><br /><br /><strong>*****<br />Please Note that the proposal due date is May 16th 2012.&nbsp; See solicitation for details.<br /><br />******<br /></strong><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ambulance Patient Compartment Testing.<br /></strong></span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I. Background</strong></span>
<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in partnership with the National Truck Equipment Association's Ambulance Manufacturers Division (AMD), is engaged in an effort to improve worker safety in the patient compartment of U.S. based ambulances. This collaborative work builds on completed research performed by NIOSH under past NIOSH funded projects. The first outcome from this joint effort was the development of AMD Standard 025, "Measuring Guidelines: Occupant Head Clearance Zones". Additional interim outcomes include the publishing of SAE J2917 "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Frontal Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment (2010)" and SAE J2956 "Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice for Occupant Restraint and Equipment Mounting Integrity - Side Impact System-Level Ambulance Patient Compartment (2011)". These two SAE Recommended Practices document the response measured in an ambulance patient compartment during front and side full vehicle crash testing, respectively. SAE J2917 and J2956 are now being used as input loading for continuing work targeting improvements in seating, cot, and equipment mount design. It should be noted that while crash testing a vehicle in a 30 mph frontal impact, as was done during the development of the SAE J2917, is a standard requirement for all passenger vehicles weighing less than 8,500 lbs. (in accordance with Federal Vehicle Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), virtually all U.S. ambulances operate above this weight and are, therefore, largely exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>With work on seating, cots, and equipment mounts underway, NIOSH and the AMD are now prepared to expand their work to include improvements to the structural integrity of the patient compartment. In an effort to move forward, the AMD established a sub-committee charged with developing a series of tests designed to better understand the loading applied to the patient compartment structure during a frontal impact (front corner of the patient compartment box) and a rollover event. The hope is to then translate these measured "dynamic" loading events into a repeatable static test for the industry's use.</p>
<p>Under this contracting effort, the Contractor shall utilize the testing methodologies proposed by the AMD Body Integrity Subcommittee (attached), to conduct dynamic and static testing of the patient compartments of several ambulances. Testing shall be conducted to accomplish several tasks: (1) validate the testing methods proposed in each dynamic test, (2) to acquire the loading experienced by the patient compartment structure during each dynamic test, and (3) to validate the methods proposed in the static test to fully exercise the patient compartment's structural integrity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>II. Project Objectives Related to this Contract</strong></span></p>
<p>This contract shall quantify the dynamic loading experienced by the patient compartment of a commercial ambulance through the use of four different testing methods. These test methods are draft documents proposed by an industry-government team of experts and borrow heavily from testing of civilian and commercial vehicles. As a part of this process, the testing methods themselves shall be evaluated and validated. At the completion of this testing program the Contractor will have created a dataset which will:</p>
<p>1. Qualify the logic and language described in each of the four proposed test methods.</p>
<p>2. Provide the data necessary for AMD and its partners to approve one to four of the proposed test methods as a new standard or standards to validate improvements in the structural integrity of patient compartment of the ambulance.</p>
<p>3. If funded as options to the effort, the pulse shapes described in SAE J2917 and SAE J2956 will be validated for use in the design of interiors for Type II (raised roof vans and Sprinters).</p>
<p>The Contractor will be expected to work to a fairly aggressive schedule as this data will be evaluated for possible inclusion in the second edition of the new National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 1917 Automotive Ambulance Standard. This is the first national consensus standard which has gained the support of most factions associated with the industry: manufacturers, end users, suppliers, and government purchasers. The first edition is expected to be published in June 2012. A comment period of 12 months will follow leading to the development of the 2nd edition. Given the goal of this research is to influence the 2nd Edition; we anticipate a need to be finished prior to June 2013.</p>
<p><strong>This requirement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis as full and open competition. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The CDC expects a single firm fixed price with a period of performance of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nine (9) months.</span></strong></p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has awarded a sole source contract to Executive Information Systems, LLC. to provide the government with WNT SAS Activity Based Management; ABM SAS Server; 5 Power Users. It was the Government's belief that only one responsible source exists that is able to satisfy agency requirements. A determination by the Government not to compete the requirement was based on the lack of response to this notice from interested persons identifying their interest and capability in response to this requirement. It is also based off of the manufacturers documentation that this is the only company certified to provide these services and products.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Contracting officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offers' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offers, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). <br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to issue an RFP for multiple Indefinite/Delivery, Indefinite/Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contracts for the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The NIH, NICHD is the lead Federal agency for the conduct of basic, clinical and epidemiological research to develop new contraceptives and to evaluate existing methods of contraception and reproductive health. The Center for Population Research (CPR), within NICHD, was established in 1968 by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, with the important goal of developing new contraceptives through the use of contracts and grants. Within CPR, the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has long supported several preclinical contraceptive testing facilities, as well as facilities for chemical and peptide synthesis. To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996 CRHB established the initial NICHD CCTN in order to conduct Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new contraceptive methods.
<p><br />The NICHD CCTN is an important component of the CRHB contraceptive development capability. Products that have undergone formulation and successful pre-clinical testing, either through the CRHB formulation and testing facilities or through outside sources, are candidates for clinical testing in the NICHD CCTN. The NICHD CCTN is particularly valuable for providing a venue for testing new contraceptive drugs and devices that have been developed by small companies that lack the resources to support large-scale clinical trials.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a re-competition of the female sites that will operate under an Indefinite/Delivery, Indefinite/Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contracts. The female sites will be able to work with the CCTN Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center (SCCC) and NICHD to rapidly develop protocols and initiate clinical trials shortly after candidate products have completed the necessary preclinical testing. The resultant IDIQ contracts will be for a seven (7) year period of performance. The CCTN female sites contractors will evaluate systematically the safety and efficacy of new female contraceptive drugs and devices as well as drug treatments of gynecologic conditions in Phase I, II, III and IV trials. The results of these clinical trials would be the basis for advancing candidate drugs and devices through development with the ultimate goal of submission to the FDA in support of a New Drug Application (NDA), Premarket notification 510k, Premarket Approval (PMA) or Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE).</p>
<p>It is estimated that the new NICHD CCTN will consist of up to 16 sites capable of performing female contraceptive clinical trials and up to 4 male sites. Please be advised that the NICHD is issuing separate RFPs for each CCTN Topic Area (Female Contraceptive Clinical Trials &amp; Male Contraceptive Clinical Trials) and the SCCC for the CCTN. <strong>This RFP is for the Female Sites&nbsp;only.</strong></p>
<p>The RFP will be made available electronically only via the FedBizOpps website (http://www.fbo.gov).<strong> Offerors are responsible for routinely checking the FedBizOpps website for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued.</strong></p>

This viability study may include assessing production configuration impacts required for systems integration, to augment the Tomahawk with an alternative navigation system for prosecuting fixed and mobile targets. This viability study will evaluate the potential impacts to the existing weapons' architectures, and assess the risks associated with a near term employment of AARGM technology. Objectives of the engineering study are to evaluate the viability of integrating the AARGM onto a Tomahawk missile/weapon system. For the purposes of this viability study, NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Alliant Techsystems (ATK), Missile Products Group, Defense Electronic System, 21301 Burbank Blvd, Suite 100, Woodland Hills, CA 91367-6678, the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for AARGM. ATK solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the missile and is the only known source capable of accomplishing the viability study. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.

Please feel free to use either site to access the information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.   

Modification 0001 is being issued to answers questions received on the subject synopsis 
N00178-12-Q-4179:  
Question 1:   The SOW provided doesn't indicate if the server must be physical or if it could be virtualized.
  Can Universal Understanding provide the service as a virtual machine that meets the required specs?  

Answer 1:      The server must be a dedicated, managed web server (as opposed to a shared server or a virtual server). In terms of where the equipment is physically located, the server should be located and managed at a vendor facility, not at NSWC Dahlgren.  

Question 2:    Do you have a preference for the distribution of Linux utilized? 

Answer 2:       CentOS is preferred, though others will be considered.

Question 3:    The SOW doesn't indicate the web server software that you would like to run, I would assume Apache; is that correct?

Answer 3:       Apache is correct.

Question 4:    Are you open to other management interfaces besides Plesk and Cpanel? 
Answer 4:       No.


Question 5:    Are there any RAID requirements for the 500 GB of storage?
Answer 5:       No.
  
All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<p>U.S. GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>General Services Administration (GSA) seeks to lease the following space:</p>
<p>State: Virginia<br />City: Arlington<br />Delineated Area: N - I-66<br />W - N. Rhodes Street<br />S - Arlington Blvd/Rt 50<br />E - Rt 110</p>
<p>Minimum Sq. Ft. (ABOA): 27,758<br />Maximum Sq. Ft. (ABOA): 27,758<br />Space Type: Office Class-A<br />Parking Spaces (Total):&nbsp;6 Government official parking spaces<br />Parking Spaces (Surface): 0<br />Parking Spaces (Structured): 0<br />Parking Spaces (Reserved): 6<br />Full Term: 5<br />Firm Term: 5<br />Option Term: <br />Additional Requirements: The United States Government currently occupies, and has a continuing need for approximately 32,071 BOMA Rentable Square Feet (BRSF) of office space and related space yielding a minimum of 27,758 Usable Square Feet (USF). The Government is seeking a 5-year firm term. The space shall be ready for occupancy no later than September 30, 2013. Whether or not an offered building can meet the required occupancy date is in the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. The delineated area is: <br />N - I-66<br />W - N. Rhodes Street<br />S - Arlington Blvd/Rt 50<br />E - Rt 110</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>The space must meet requirements for fire-safety plus handicapped access in accordance with ABAAS guidelines. The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced.</p>

<p>9) Name, address, telephone number, and email address of individual to be contacted.<br />10) Name of closest Metro Rail Station and distance in walkable linear feet from the Metro Rail Station.</p>
<p>In the event that a potential Offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government's minimum requirements.<br /><br />Submission by anyone other than the owner or manager of a property must be accompanied by a letter from the ownership granting permission to make a general offering of space. In instances where the Offeror is representing more than one property, the Offeror is hereby notified that they may only participate in negotiations on behalf of one owner.</p>
<p><br />Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease. A fully serviced lease is required. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition for security screening services at Key West International Airport (EYW), Greater Rochester International Airport (ROC) and Tupelo Regional Airport (TUP). Accordingly, the TSA intends to award a contract to:
<p>Raytheon Technical Services Company, LLC<br />12160 Sunrise valley dr.<br />Reston, VA 20191-3407</p>

<p><br />Trinity Technology Group</p>
<p>3701 Pender Drive<br />Fairfax, VA 22030</p>
<p>These contracts will address the requirements of the Office of Security Operations Screening Partnership Program's need for security screening services at EYW, ROC and TUP. The current contracts are set to expire on May 31, 2012 and bridge contracts are necessary in order to ensure the congressionally mandated services continue.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. The Government will notify parties of the outcome of any proposal submitted in response. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above named company directly.</p>

The NBCSPG plays a vital role in digitizing the NBC battlespace and provides the soldier with a set of user interfaces to command and monitor disparate NBC sensors and other reconnaissance vehicle systems. The NBCSPG automatically integrates contamination data, time and location data, meteorological data, and data from other systems to produce NBC hazard intelligence reports. The NBCSPG interfaces with the NBCRV Command and Control system, Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2), and automates transmission of NBC reports to and from the NBC battlespace.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on behalf of Product Management-Force Protection Systems (PdM-FPS) has a requirement for Full Rate (FRP) production of the Lighting Kit Motion Detection (LKMD) program. LKMD is a small, modular, unattended tactical ground sensor-based early warning system providing early detection and warning of intrusions. LKMD provides enhanced force effectiveness and situational awareness during all types of combat operations or missions. LKMD further enhances force protection by operating as a tactical stand-alone system, a supplemental device for use with other force protection and physical security systems or as part of an integrated layered situational awareness concept. LKMD provides programmable responses of illumination and/or sound, resulting in increased operational reaction time for individuals, teams, squads or platoons. Capable of being programmed and placed into operation quickly, LKMD allows the soldier to remotely program response configurations and is quickly recoverable. The sensor provides a pre-programmed response of audible/silent alarms and sends data to the hand-held remote control, notifying the operator of a detected target. Upon detection of a target entering the specified area, it activates the modules providing a pre-programmed illumination response.

<DESC><br /><br /><br />The objective of this contract is to obtain technical assistance to support the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response&nbsp;(NSIR)/Division of Preparedness and Response (DPR) by performing reviews of up to 65 updated Evacuation Time Estimates (ETE) studies that will be submitted to the NRC by Nuclear Power Plant&nbsp;licensees in accordance with the new Emergency Preparedness&nbsp;Rule.&nbsp;SwRI will perform the reviews to confirm that the updated ETEs are complete. <br /><br />This is a non-competitive procurement under FAR 6.302-3 (Class Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition attached). A cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract was suitable in this instance due to the uncertainty involved in contract performance that does not permit costs to be established with sufficient accuracy to use a Fixed Price type contract. <br />

<AWARDEE>Northwest Habitat Institute, 2223 Primrose Loop, Philomath, OR 97370-9540 US
<DESC>Evaluate habitat conditions using the Combined Habitat Assessment Protocols (CHAP) for the without-project condition (no-action alternative) and for the with-project condition for selected alternatives, for a period of 50 years. Provide a report conveying and evaluating the findings that will be adequate for assessing the fish and wildlife habitat impacts and effects of each evaluated alternative in relation to the without-project conditions.<br /><br />Sole Source award based on the following rationale: <br /><br />The Northwest Habitat Institute (NHI), a non-profit organization, was the developer of the Habitat Appraisal and Barter (HAB) methodology, an ecosystem-based framework that builds upon a triad approach of species, habitat, and functions. The HAB method was later combined with elements from the US Fish and Wildlife Services' Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) to form the Combined Habitat Assessment Protocol (CHAP). NHI has a unique knowledge of CHAP because they developed it. They have since tested it in the Pacific Northwest with the Oregon Department of Wildlife, the Oregon Department of Transportation, Washington Department of Wildlife, and the Washington Department of Transportation, and in California with CESPL; contact Thomas Keeney at 213-452-3875 for more information on SPL's use of CHAP.<br />Previously, the Corps has used HEP to evaluation habitat quality. However, HEP is outmoded and has important technical shortcomings which is why the Project Delivery Team for the Shoreline Study has chosen CHAP as our habitat evaluation method. CHAP is currently being<br />reviewed by the Corps ecological Planning Center of Expertise (PCX) for potential nation-wide use to replace the outdated HEP.<br />CHAP performs the following whereas other habitat accounting methods do not:<br />o Implements information in the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship (CWHR) database to make links between species, habitat, and function.<br />o Implements information in the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) to make links between vegetation types and function.<br />o Measures habitat quality using diversity, complexity and available habitat size.<br />o Produces mapping through the use of GIS, field inventory, and comprehensive specieshabitat- functions relationships.<br />o Uses geo-referenced aerial imagery for sites, vegetation/habitat types delineated using GIS (in-office), visual land formation differences, vegetation, and vegetation structural conditions.<br />o Considers species' ecological functions within a habitat.<br />o Utilizes the needs and functions of a large number of species instead of just a few. NHI has a patent on CHAP and for now there are no other providers of CHAP services. That will change eventually with the development of a training program but the study cannot wait for this eventuality. Alternately, it would be highly inefficient for the District to hire staff to redevelop this habitat accounting method independently, and this would in any case not be<br />possible given available funds and time constraints.

VETERANS BENEFIT ADMINISTRATION
COMPENSATION SERVICE PROGRAM

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Purpose:

This Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the Office of Acquisition Operations, Acquisition Service, Frederick, Maryland, on behalf of the US Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefits Administration, which administers the Compensation Service Program.   

2.  Background:

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), through the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), administers the Compensation Service Program for benefits for veterans, their dependents, and their survivors.  Entitlement determinations for disability compensation claims and disability pension claims are made by VBA Rating Veterans Service Representatives (RVSRs) working in VA Regional Offices (VAROs) across the country.  A medical disability examination is a critical piece of evidence for determining the extent of permanent impairment and the dollar benefit a veteran is awarded.

Congress enacted the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1996 (PL 104-275) on October 9, 1996, which authorized VA to conduct a limited pilot program to contract for Medical Disability Examinations (MDEs) from non-VA medical sources.  Under PL 108-183, Section 704, Congress granted VA temporary authority to contract out for MDEs, which is in addition to the authority provided in PL 104-275.

The VA issued Contract No. VA798-11-D-0008 to retain a contractor to perform MDEs under PL 108-183.  The contract's period of performance is November 1, 2010 through April 30, 2012, and is valued at a maximum of $50,000,000.00. The Government intends to re-compete the contract for MDE services, but until that competition and award are made, the need for MDEs continues unabated so that Veterans can continue to be rated for the appropriate benefits and treatment they deserve. The lack of readily available MDEs will mean unwarranted delays and de facto denials of both treatment and benefit delivery to affected Veterans causing ongoing or worsening harm to those Veterans in need of and deserving of requisite VA benefits and support. 

VBA requires an MDE in order to determine (a) whether a Veteran is entitled to specific disability benefits and treatment, and (b) the level and degree of care required. The MDE is a vital first step to determining what care a Veteran deserves and should receive with a minimum of delay. 

The Government intends to negotiate a four-month bridge contract with four one-month option periods, subject to the availability of appropriated funds, with the current PL 108-183 contractor, Veterans Evaluation Services, Inc. (VES),  to provide MDEs for the following ROs currently being serviced under VA798-11-D-0008: 
1.	Cleveland, Ohio
2.	Des Moines, Iowa
3.	Denver, Colorado
4.	Indianapolis, Indiana
5.	Lincoln, Nebraska
6.	St. Louis, Missouri
7.	Waco, Texas
8.	Honolulu, Hawaii

3.  Description of Services

The four-month bridge contract with options will continue to provide the following services at each of the ROs listed above.  Services ordered under the contract are limited to the ROs listed above and the budget for these services will be spread across the ROs based on program office demand forecasts. The following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) describe the services ordered under the original contract that need to be continued until the MDE contract is recompeted.

	Partial No Show:   If Veteran does not contact vendor within the acceptable timeframe to reschedule, but does request a rescheduled appointment.  No show is charged on initial appointment, but at a lower price, since administrative prep work is eventually used by examiner.

This bridge contract shall be placed in anticipation of the award of an appropriate, longer term fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The bridge will extend the Medical Disability Examination support services through the end of the year and the expiration of PL 108-183 (December 31, 2012).

Anticipated performance start date for the bridge contract is May 1, 2012 and the anticipated performance start date for the longer term, more permanent IDIQ contract is expected to be November 30, 2012.  

The anticipated bridge contract base performance period is May 1, 2012 through August 31, 2012.  VA will not otherwise be able to provide vital services and benefits continuously to deserving Veterans without the bridge contract that will both continue the flow of necessary services and treatment to affected Veterans while allowing VA sufficient time to re-compete the long-term MDE IDIQ contract.  
The four one-month option periods are to ensure continued performance of MDEs while a newly-awarded IDIQ Contractor completes the estimated 90-day start-up period to begin providing MDE services, and to include sufficient time leading up to the expiration of the current Public Law 108-183 (December 31, 2012).

There is not enough time to secure a follow-on contract to avoid a break in necessary benefits and care for affected Veterans without this contract, and not enough time to compete the requirement to avoid said service break. 

4.  Identification of statutory authority.

The incumbent contractor will continue the support services currently provided through a sole source contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C.  253(c)(1), the services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  

5.  Demonstration of contractors' unique qualifications.

VA has a contract in place for services related to Public Law (P.L.) 108-183. The Fiscal Year (FY) 08 IDIQ contract was competitively awarded for performance beginning April 1, 2008 and MES Solutions was the successful offeror.  (MES Solutions' corporate name was changed to Veterans Evaluations Services, Inc. (VES) effective April 1, 2011.)  Subsequently, a sole source bridge contract was awarded to VES to enable continued performance through April 30, 2012.

Funds were not available during the Continuing Resolution passed by Congress until December 23, 2011.  With appropriation uncertainties and Congressional authority for contracting examinations set to expire on December 31, 2012, VBA leadership waited to make a decision regarding the MDE PL 108-183 contract recompete until the Budget passed on December 23, 2011.  Based on the current contract, and competitive proposals expected to be received from a number of vendors, the industry standard minimum start-up period is approximately 90-days, due to the complexity of coordinating services between eight different locations through the United States, as well as the high level of information technology coordination and information security issues that must be in place before performance can begin awarding a new contract to a new vendor would not allow sufficient time for the vendor to sufficiently meet this start-up period prior to expiration of the current contract, which greatly increases the risk of unsuccessful performance and a break in services for the above mentioned eight ROs. The contracting officer recommends a four-month bridge contract, with four one-month options, be awarded to the existing IDIQ contractor in order to establish stop-gap measures to provide the required services to meet the existing mission of VBA MDE program.

VES currently has the personnel in place and is capable of meeting  the additional, immediate MDE requirement without  needing a ramp-up period.  No other contractors will be able to recruit, obtain credentialing (applicable to Medical Examiners), coordinate the IT and information security requirements with all eight VA facilities, or have their employees in place by the May 1, 2012 performance start in order to avoid a lapse in service.

VES is the only responsible source capable of fulfilling immediate agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1) without unacceptable delays in delivering benefits to worthy Veterans.  The need is compelling (FAR 6.302-2), and it is in the public's and agency's interests to continue to secure these services pending a regular award for such (FAR 6.302-7).  

6.  Federal Business Opportunities announcement/potential 
Current contracts lacked provisions to continue past April 30, 2012.   and in order to meet the requirements of FAR Part 5 and FAR Part 6.3 Other Than Full and Open Competition, a notice of "Intent to Procure via Sole Source" shall be published in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps).  
 
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Costs

The contracting officer does not expect escalation of the proposed rates because the term of this contract, including all options, is eight months.  However, a price fair and reasonableness determination will be made by comparing the results of the market survey (see Paragraph 8, below) with the price proposal received from the incumbent contractor.   

8.  Market Research.

The minimum dollar value for the IDIQ and base period is $2,000,000, and the maximum is $12,000,000, including all option periods.  Based on historical data from the previous ten-month period, the average examination cost was $1,043 and 2,248 examinations were performed each month which equated to $2,110,436 in examination costs per month. 
The estimated examination performance is anticipated to be lower for this contract based on available funds in the budget.  It is expected that approximately 7,700 examinations will be completed with an average examination cost of $1,043 per exam, which would result in approximately 
$8,000,000 in examination costs including the base period and all option periods.  

Historical performance indicates a higher level of performance; however, due to funding constraints, the number of examination requests has been reduced to meet the expected level of available funding.  If additional funding becomes available, the level of funds allocated to the contract will be increased to meet the needs of the Agency, as the need for examinations continues to increase. The contract maximum includes the possibility of additional funding being made available. 
 

RO	IGCE for Base Period + All Options
Cleveland, Ohio	$560,000.00 
Des Moines, Iowa	$1,840,000.00 
Denver, Colorado	$2,640,000.00 
Honolulu, Hawaii	$600,000.00 
Indianapolis, Indiana	$960,000.00 
Lincoln, Nebraska	$200,000.00 
St. Louis, Missouri	$0.00 
Waco, Texas	$1,200,000.00 
Total	$8,000,000.00

VES, the current contractor, is the only known source capable of delivering MDE services as VBA requires without any interruption of services or benefits to Veterans given the scope and complexity of MDE processes and evaluations.

9.  Any other supporting facts.

It should be noted that MDEs are the primary means for qualifying Veterans for VA medical benefits.  A lapse in performance of MDEs over any period of time would harm Veterans due to a delay in determining eligibility for VA benefits

10.  Listing of interested sources.  

The incumbent contractor, Veterans Evaluation Services, Inc. (VES), is the only known source that is able to meet this requirement for the reasons listed in Paragraph 5, above.

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition.

The bridge contract is intended to balance VA's need for continued performance of MDE services with the need to provide competition for a longer term, more permanent contract for these services.  The longer term, more permanent contract for MDE services is being solicited and awarded under the basis of full and open competition while the bridge contract ensures continuity of performance.
