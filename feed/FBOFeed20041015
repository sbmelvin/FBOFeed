<SUBJECT>A -- Dynamic Tactical Targeting: Tactical Exercises and System Testing (DTT:TEST)
<SOLNBR>BAA05-04
<RESPDATE>112904
<ARCHDATE>12142004
<CONTACT>Michael Blackstone, Contracting Officer, Phone (571) 218-4804, Fax (703) 696-2208, Email mblackstone@darpa.mil - Robert Tenney, DARPA Program Manager, IXO, Phone (000) 000-0000, Fax (571) 218-4550, Email rtenney
<DESC>DYNAMIC TACTICAL TARGETING: TACTICAL EXERCISES AND SYSTEM TEST (DTT:TEST), SOL BAA 05-04, DUE:  29 November 2004; Technical POC: Dr. Robert R. Tenney, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (703) 741-0081.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Information Exploitation Office (IXO) is soliciting proposals for the Dynamic Tactical Targeting: Tactical Exercises and System Test (DTT:TEST) program under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). 
BACKGROUND: The Dynamic Tactical Targeting (DTT) program currently is developing technology to continuously cross-cue a large set of heterogeneous, partially controllable sensor platforms to maintain track on known targets, while maintaining search efforts to find new candidate targets, so that known targets can be held at risk until a commander authorizes engagement.  Abstractly, the sensors can be viewed as a pool of resources, and mission needs (search an area, maintain track on a designated vehicle) as prioritized demands.  DTT is the process that continuously, and proactively, assigns resources to demands as the situation changes:  new missions are defined, known vehicles move, new vehicles are found, existing tracks degrade, etc.  The DTT program began in 1999, and is ending this year.  It developed an initial set of software components, integrated into a complete, closed-loop system, that clearly validated the above premise, but validated the premise only on simulated data.  Simulated data simply cannot contain all of the artifacts and error sources present in the real world.  The Dynamic Tactical Targeting: Tactical Exercises and System Testing (DTT:TEST) program has been created to validate the premise in live exercises, leveraging companion efforts in the Army (affiliated with the Future Combat System) and Air Force (affiliated with the Distributed Common Ground Station).  PROGRAM OBJECTIVE:  The DTT:TEST program will validate the premise that we can employ automated tools to 1) align the transformed sensor data to a common geospatial reference system; 2) correlate data across sources into consistent target tracks;  3) predict future target motion; 4) create sensor-specific tasking that develops the most effective way to employ sensors in the context of anticipated target motion (for targets in track) and remaining search tasks (for targets yet to be discovered); and 5) allow a commander and her staff to maintain situation awareness and supervise the operation of the automation.  The DTT:TEST program will build and integrate technologies for these five areas, and exercise them on real-world sensor data, both recorded and live.  Some of these technologies may be drawn from those funded by the original DTT program, but IXO is aware of, and interested in, other, equally mature technologies that may outperform those employed by DTT to date.  Validation will be accomplished in live exercises, leveraging companion efforts in the Army and Air Force.  
PROGRAM STRUCTURE:  The DTT:TEST program contains five coordinated, technology-intensive components developed in parallel, and two system integration and evaluation efforts .  This BAA solicits proposals to develop these technology areas, using novel technologies to achieve the functional capabilities described in the Proposal Information Pamphlet (PIP), available at the URL provided below.  The objective of DTT:TEST is to develop the highest and most robust level of automation possible for these components, recognizing they will always be supervised by a commander and her staff.  The seven program elements are:  (1) Registration:  Use reported sensor/platform status reports, correlations between sensor data and fiducials, and correlations of sensor reports to friendly vehicle status reports to estimate parameters associated with systematic sources of error in sensor/platform reporting processes.   Continuously adjust current and historical sensor data to eliminate these errors.  Modify reported confidence information to account properly for this adjustment.  (2) Prediction:  Given an initial area in which a vehicle is hypothesized to exist, and some indication of the vehicle type, use terrain and environmental knowledge to compute the area, as a function of time, which that vehicle can reach.  Ensure that the predicted area is valid for both benign and evasive targets.  (3) Fusion:  Combine report- and track-level data into a consistent set of target tracks and accompanying state estimates, both current and historical.   Properly account for reporting delays between sensors and the DTT system, and processing artifacts (e.g., statistical correlation) introduced along that path.  Allow the use of vehicle-specific identity information (“fingerprints”) to correlate reports and tracks separated widely in time.  Regularly and frequently update target state estimates to maintain a current situation estimate.  (4) Control:  Given a set of missions, partial knowledge of targets expressed as target state estimates and predicted location envelopes, an ISR force consisting of fixed and mobile sensors, a set of operating constraints, and knowledge of terrain and weather, construct kinematically feasible platform routes and sensor tasking schedules to maximize mission accomplishment.  After approval or modification by commanders, publish the routes and schedules to the affected systems.  Continuously update the routes and schedules as target estimates change, as platforms and sensors execute their missions, and as mission commanders refine mission definitions.  (5) Command:  Continuously update situation estimates derived by the DTT system on a physically separated, networked set of command workstations.  In this context, elicit ISR mission needs from mission commanders through a shared, collaborative workspace.  Transform graphical and tabular input data into a formal machine representation capable of guiding sensor tasking.  Display system-derived sensor routes and schedules for approval or modification.  Track progress against each mission, and generate alerts when missions appear infeasible.  (6) System Design and Integration: Establish common data representations that support information exchange among the technical components; develop a DTT:TEST system architecture and supporting intra-component software interface; build and operate an unclassified, internet-accessible software integration facility; and design and conduct a rigorous system-level test regimen to verify correct functional behavior. (7) Experiment Design and Evaluation: Define system- and component-level metrics; design instrumentation to obtain data from field instrumentation and components to compute those metrics; maintain and operate a classified DTT:TEST exercise facility (in Building 620, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base); establish secure, low-latency connectivity between that facility and the exercise partners. PROGRAM PHASES:  The DTT:TEST program will be conducted as a single, 24-month effort .  For planning purposes, assume the program extends from 1 January 2005 through 31 December  2006.  Within the 24-month period, the program will proceed in quarterly (3-month) development spirals.  Each spiral will involve:  (1) Definition of system-level functionality upgrades;  (2) Updates to interface control documents;  (3) Definition of test coverage and schedule at the integration facility;  (4) Delivery of intermediate component software, nominally monthly, to support testing; and  (5) Delivery of a final version of the system to the classified exercise lab.  Exercises will be conducted on an opportunistic basis, managed to conform to schedules of other activities sponsoring the exercises.  Each exercise will be conducted using the then-current version of the system software in the classified lab.  In addition, the classified lab will contain a Government-supplied simulation capability to support functional testing and evaluation.  At the end of each spiral, the Experiment Design and Evaluation effort will deliver quantitative assessments of component and system level performance.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be selected through a technical/scientific/business decision process, with technical and scientific considerations being most important.  Evaluations will be performed using the following criteria, listed in descending order of relative importance:  (1) Relevance to DTT:TEST mission objectives;  (2) Consistency with DTT:TEST program concepts;  (3) Technical innovation and depth;  (4) Personnel and corporate capabilities and experience; and
(5) Cost realism and value of proposed work to the Government.  Further details may be found in the PIP, which can be accessed at the e-mail address provided in GENERAL INFORMATION below.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype hardware and/or software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  This BAA shall remain open and proposals accepted up to one year following this BAA’s release.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center(NSWCIH), Indian Head, MD. intends to award a Sole Source Purchase Order to Viscotek Corporation for a Gel-Permeation Chromatography(GPC) System. The GPC/SEC system is an instrument used for the determination of absolute molecular weight,  molecular size, intrinsic viscosity, conformation, aggregation, and degree of branching. The GPC is configured with a tetra detector array composed of a four capillary differential viscometer and evaporative light scattering detector in conjunction with RI and UV for direct measurement of intrinsic viscosity, molecular density, and molecular weight. This tetra detection technology includes pumps, auto or manual injectors, integrated chromatography systems, and automated sample preparation capabilities. Tetra Detection is unique only to Viscotek Systems, and sets the standard for characterizing natural and synthetic polymers and proteins. The GPC system will be used by  NAVSEA for acceptance testing of ! new materials and aging programs to monitor breakdown of binders manifested by physical property changes. The GPC will also provide lower costs (less time to run each sample), virtually no maintenance costs and allow greater flexibility in the types of materials that NAVSEA will be able  to analyze. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 339111 with a size standard of 500 employees.. The FSC code is 6640. Approximate issue date of this Purchase Order is 29 October 2004. For information regarding this synopsis, you may contact Willy B. Quiambao who can be reached at (301) 744-6789 or email quiambaowb@ih.navy.mil.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541519     This is a notice of intent, not a Request for Quotation or solicitation.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, WA for the renewal of Microsoft Premier Support, Account Number 64494.  Microsoft Premier Support includes the following services:  1) Service elements, 2) Problem resolution support, and 3) Information services and workshops.  Service elements includes: 1) up to 200 hours of service resource time, 2) SAM and SA hours, which can be used for infrastructure support assistance, reviews, development support assistance, and lab, 3) planning and resource facilitation, 4) status meetings and reporting, and 5) escalation management.  The problem resolution support includes 1) fifty (50) support incidents, 2) hot fixes, 3) critical problem alerts, and 4) multi-vendor coordination.  The information services and workshops include 1) newsflashes and 2) unlimited-user service desk license, which includes one (1) prepaid site visit (up to 2-days, NA only), one (1) Microsoft TechNet Plus Subscription (single server), and one (1) MSDN Subscription.  Microsoft Premier Support from Microsoft provides direct and quick access to internal Microsoft software developers and source codes for current and future products twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.  The BOP requires such resources because system failures that are not resolved quickly could jeopardize the safe and secure operation of BOP institutions.  Purchasing support from a reseller or a third party vendor does not be meet the BOP’s requirements, as the BOP would not have direct access to Microsoft’s source code and developers, which are essential for the immediate access the BOP needs to resolve system failures that may impact the operations of our institutions.  This proposed noncompetitive action will be processed in accordance with FAR 13.  BOP plans to issue this requirement as a firm fixed price purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, which will be awarded to Microsoft Corporation, ArrowPoint 2, 8050 Microsoft Way, Charlotte, NC 28273.  The period of performance will be from November 27, 2004 to November 26, 2005.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Any information shall be clearly marked with Reference: NAS-0048-2005 and must be received on or before November 3, 2004 by 12:00 noon local time (Washington DC).  Any information not received by the date/time and at the location specified in this notice will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Point of Contact for all information regarding this acquisition is Kristy Beck, Contract Specialist or Greg Sinsel, Contracting Officer, at the address and phone numbers listed below.

<DESC>The following synopsis is a replacement for the previous synopses posted under Solicitations USCA-03-R-0073 and USCA-03-R-0073A.  In general, the prior synopses requested interested firms to submit SF 254s and SF 255s.  Specifically, this new solicitation modifies the list of potential tasks and the selection criteria and requires interested firms to submit or re-submit their qualifications using only the SF 330.  This applies to firms that have previously responded as well as those that have not yet responded.   The response date is open and will remain open indefinitely.  Note: You will not be notified unless your firm has been selected to perform a task (see below).

In this synopsis, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) requests submission of  SF 330s (only) by Architectural/Engineering firms desiring to be considered for government contracts not to exceed $100,000.  The Sf 330 information will be compiled and managed in a database by a permanent AO Architect/Engineer Selection Board.  Please do not submit any information other than the SF 330 as it will be discarded.  Only the SF 330 will be filed and stored, and only information in the SF 330 will be entered in the database and considered for potential tasks.  No actual contract documentation or construction administration (or new building designs) will result as part of these broad-based Architectural/Engineering services tasks.  Tasks will consist of providing limited assistance to the judiciary and the AO on individual projects, primarily as conducted for the judiciary by the General Services Administration (GSA).  Tasks may include, but are not limited to, project-related program and design analysis and evaluation; small scale schematic design; furniture and interiors services; technical document reviews; value engineering services; architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and structural analysis and evaluation; historical preservation studies; courtroom technologies consultation; blast-resistant and security design criteria development; environmental (sick building) testing and analysis; and preparation of other studies and reports to support the judiciary.  Potential tasks will be geographically located only throughout the 50 United States and the U.S. Territories.  Travel may be, but is not always, required.  In no prioritized order of importance, individual tasks will be awarded to firms based on a combination of the following criteria:  (1) Past performance on contracts with the judiciary, other government entities, and private industry, in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with the U.S. Courts Design Guide and performance schedules; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3)  Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; and (5) Staffed location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality.  In making the award determination for each task the AO Architect/Engineer Selection Board will rank the firms most qualified to perform the work and provide its list to the Contracting Officer (CO) who will review it, make the final selection list, attempt to negotiate a fair and reasonable price with the firm ranked first and, if successful, award to that firm.  If unsuccessful, the CO will attempt to negotiate with the next firm on the list and so forth, until award is made or it is necessary to request an additional listing from the selection board.  This process will continue until award is accomplished.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Sensors Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/SN) will host a one-half day, classified briefing of the planned Sensor Technology Research, Development, Test & Evaluation Open-Ended Broad Agency Announcement (STROEB) BAA 04-03-SNK entitled Scaleable Panels for Efficient Affordable Radars (SPEAR) Spiral 1.  The intent of hosting a Bidders Conference is to inform the technical community of the government plans and related activities to AFRL/SN’s SPEAR Spiral 1 program.  The objective of this program is to develop technology needed to produce modular/scaleable, low power density antenna panels that meet future Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) radar requirements.  This technology development should demonstrate the feasibility of producing tiles/panels at significantly lower per element cost than current “brick” architectures.  This effort should validate a panel design with respect to:  radio frequency performance, power consumption, thermal performance, mechanical characteristics, and implementation of an open system architecture.  This effort should produce sufficient hardware for future experiments investigating array-level issues such as coherence, calibration and system thermal management.  The briefing will be limited to interested representatives of U.S. Government agencies and U.S. contractors only.  Contractor participation will be subject to the same restrictions specified on the STROEB BAA.  The briefing will be held on Thursday, Oct 28, 2004 from 1200 to 1700, at WPAFB (directions/maps to the specific meeting location will be provided with registration confirmation).  Organizations wishing their representatives to attend the Bidders Conference should respond via e-mail to Ms. Noelle Spalding, Det 1 AFRL/PKSR at Noelle.Spalding@wpafb.af.mil.  Firms are limited to four registrants at the conference due to limited seating.  All briefing materials and questions and answers will be made available upon request to confirmed registrants.  Registration emails must be received no later than 3pm (NLT) Friday, Oct 22, 2004.  Registration will be confirmed via e-mail NLT Monday, Oct 25, 2004. Each individual must submit the following information: last name, first name, business title, organization, full street address, city, state, zip code, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address. Technical questions regarding the meeting should be directed to Roger (Kip) Turner, Program Manager, (937) 255-4794 x4054, e-mail: Roger.Turner@wpafb.af.mil, AFRL/SNZT.  Questions of a contractual nature should be directed to Noelle Spalding, Contract Negotiator, (937) 656-9837, or David Shellabarger, Contracting Officer, (937) 255-4863.

PN 2026M71P01:  Basic 368 each, Option I--231 each, Option II--230 each, Option III--147 each...Total--976 each.  All other terms remain unchanged.


NSN:  To be determined.
PN:   Multiple, see below list.
Nomenclatures:  Mixing Duct (PN:  1452M70G06), Spray Bar Damper Rings (PN: 2026M71P01), Segmented Flameholders (PN: 2026M64G04).  
	Note 1:  Additional PN 2026M64G06 quantities included in total flameholder estimate.  Flameholder will change from one piece to ten separate segments consisting of nine each PN 2026M64G04 and one each of 2026M64G06.

Item Description:  With funded airframe and avionics modifications, the F16C/D will continue to support Air Combat Command’s force structure through 2025.  The F110-GE-100 (F-16C/D Block 30/40) and F110-GE-129 (F-16C/D Block 50) engine weapon systems including augmenter/exhaust system are exceeding their original design life.  The augmenter/exhaust nozzle section is a leading contributor of labor intensive, unscheduled engine removals directly related to excessively repaired parts subject to thermal variances.  The augmenter/exhaust nozzle refurbishment, in conjunction with Service Life Extension Life (SLEP) and Aging Engine Upgrade (AEU) initiatives, is required to meet the funded, extended design life for the airframe.  This effort requires timely delivery of newly designed F100 hardware to support the refurbishment of the F110-GE-100 and –129 engine augmenters that will be refurbished on specific schedules at the  OC-ALC depot.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Kennedy Space Center Sabbatical Program; NNK04ZOP0010 which was posted on September 20, 2004. You are notified that the following changes are made: Add the following full descriptions to the Six Technical Areas: 1.  Seal-Healing Wire Insulation:  The technical approach for the proposed development of new manual repair methods that can lead to self-repair technologies is divided into three phases.  The first phase would demonstrate proof-of-concept (POC) for the repair of Kapton, Teflon and vinyl type insualtion.  The second phase would develop breadboard designs of the repair processes demonstrated in the POC phase.	The third phase would develop prototype designs that would lead to qualification testing and acceptance of the final products.  Currently, we are completing the POC for Kapton insulation.  The primary goal of the project is to develop the technology required to repair Kapton, Teflon, and vinyl type electrical insulation that is self-repairing.  To accomplish this primary goal several secondary goals must be met, which are listed below:     a.	The composition of the repair material should have physical and chemical properties that are similar to the original insulation material.  For example, the repair material for Kapton repair material should apply a Kapton-type repair material and the same is true for Teflon and vinyl materials.  In addition, the thermal properties of the repair material should be similar to the insulation.     b.	Chemical heaters that apply the required amount of heat should be used, thus eliminating the need for heat-guns.  Initiation of the heating system should be simple, such as, adding a small amount of water or exposure to oxygen in the air.      c.  The chemical toxicity of the repair materials should be low to reduce health hazards for repair technicians.  The safe use of chemical heaters has been demonstrated by their successful use to heat the Army's Meals Ready to Eat (MRE).      d.  The repair for Kapton-type insulation should address problems associated with stresses at each end of the repair.  One approach would use a gradual increase in the thickneww of the repair material at each end of the repair to provide a smooth transition in flexibility at the point of repair.      e.  The steps in the repair process should be simple and intuitive to minimize incorrect application of the repair material. QUALIFICATIONS:  The ideal candidate would have a PhD in organic or polymer chemistry with 10 or more years of hands-on experience in organic synthesis and/or polymer chemistry.  An added benefit would be experience with microencapsulation or self-initiating processes. 2.  Sensor Technology Development.  The development of distributed sensor networks for flight vehicles and ground support equipment is highly desirable.  These networks will be utilized in support of Health Management Systems.  Work to be performed includes:     a.	Definition and optimization of sensor network architectures;     b.	Definition and optimization of sensor network communication media (wireless, fiber optic, etc);     c.	Definition of communication protocols, data distribution, data transfer speed, data latency and synchronization, data collision, etc;     d.	System robustness, reliability and auto reconfiguration capabilities; and     e.	Process knowledge sharing and data validation among network elements. QUALIFICATIONS:  Electrical/electronics background with emphasis in communication, networks and instrumentation. 3.  Bioregenerative Life Support:  Bioregenerative life support at KSC is carried out by a number of experts in bioractor design and operation, horticulture, plant physiology, microbial ecology and microbial genetics and physiology.  Missing from this skill mix is an individual with adequate modeling skills to provide quantitative descriptions of the processes being investigated.  We are seeking a sabbatical appointment for an individual with modeling skills to assist in developing models of both individual reactors (such as ARMS (Aerobic Rotational Membrane bioractor System)) and reactor systems (such as ARMS linked to sequential filtration and reverse osmosis).  We would anticipate development of a longer-term relationship in which the individual would continue to work with us in modelgin reactor or plant production systems in the future as well as to transfer some level of modeling ability to resident staff.   QUALIFICATIONS:  The facult participant should have a PhD in an appropriate scientific or engineering discipline, with a publication record appropriate for the time in rank.  The individual should demonstrate the ability to construct appropriate models and be able to design and conduct physical experiments to calibrate the models and test their performance.  Individual should be available for an entire academic year. 4.  Coupling Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) to Regolith Oxygen Extraction:  The use of an RWGS reactor to produce CO for reduction of regolith has been studied in an SBIR Phase II project.  Losses of carbon (from disproportionation of CO and/or carbide formation) to the processed ore is a problem.  The addition of CO2 can alleviate this problem, an at the same time, reduce the need for a recycle pump in the RWGS unit.  A more tightly coupled RWGS/regolith reduction process might simplify both systems, making the overall system both more efficient and low in consumables (carbon), an important factor for Lunar use of RWGS.   QUALIFICATIONS:  Chemical or metallurgical engineer with expertise in ore reduction, process analysis and modeling. 4.  Upper Stage Liquid Propellant Stratification Modeling:  Develop an upper stage thermal stratification model of liquid propellants for insertion into gross tank models for proper modeling of fluid stratification & boil-off.  A thorough review of the literature on the mathematical modeling of thermal stratification in a reduced gravity environment will commence upon startup of this activity.  The review must include single and multiple constituents.  Upon completion of the literature review, a status and down select of available mathematical models will be made.  The down selected mathematical model will be implemented as a FORTRAN subroutine for use in a thermal model.  Extended launch timelines have been proposed by ELV launch vehicle providers and spacecraft mission teams.	The success of timelines with three or more cryogenic upper state burns depends on boil-off rate of propellants and oxidizers on orbit.  Since most upper stages in use today were not designed for long duration storage of cryogenic propellants, a method must be developed to model, simulate and predict cryo-fluid behavior in the space environment so that mission success can be assured and any needed design modifications can be identified and implemented. QUALIFICATIONS:  PhD in physics/engineering with experience in thermal/fluid modeling and simulation. 6.  Alternate Refractory Materials for Flame Deflectors:  The technical approach for the proposed material testing and qualification procedure development is to be implemented in three phases.  The first phase would use the faculty member to develop plans and implement procedures to characterize the environment in the flame deflectors during launch.  This informaiton will then be used in the second phase to develop laboratory material qualification test procedures that can characterize critical material indicators such that the performance of these refractory materials can be reliably assessed.  The third phase would evaluate the validity of the test program performed in phase two by exposing refractory materials to actual launch conditions.  The primary goal of the project is to develop qualification specifications for refractory materials and to have the university faculty member assist us with implementing and validating these specifications.  To accomplish this primary goal several secondary goals must be met, which are listed below:     a.	Work shall mainly be done at KSC.  Exceptions to this should include testing when appropriate equipment or expertise is not available at KSC or when analyses can be performed without the need of KSC expertize.     b.	As appropriate, test environments should represent conditions in the flame deflector during launches.     c.	The specification(s) should be written in KSC specification format.     d.	All specifications shall use English units (pounds, inches, etc.). QUALIFICATIONS:  The ideal candidate would have significant experience intesting and specification development of cementitious materials with existing knowledge of flame deflectors and NASA specifications.  Because the scope of work is significant, the option of having the facultymember bring a graduate student from his or her home institution to assist with the work should be considered. The due date for responses IS NOT extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/KSC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

<DESC>The NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the design, fabrication, assembly, delivery, installation, and certification of two Class 10,000 ( per MIL-STD-1246) laminar flow cleanroom enclosures in adjacent bays within an existing Class 100,000 Payload Processing Facility (PPF).  The facility, Astrotech Space Operations (ASO), is located in Titusville, Florida and is used for processing NASA satellites.  Additionally, a Class 10,000 laminar flow clean tent is needed in a Hazardous Processing Facility (HPF) at a second Astrotech building.  The two (2) PPF cleanroom enclosures shall be delivered, certified, and operational by October 15, 2005.  The HPF clean tent shall be delivered, installed, certified, and operational by November 15, 2005.  The offeror shall identify any impacts to the existing Astrotech facility as a result of installation of the cleanroom enclosures or the clean tent (i.e., Heat load, humidity control, power requirements, physical changes, noise, vibration levels, etc).

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division is seeking potential sources to support the E-6B pilot and aircrew training program conducted by Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron SEVEN (VQ-7) and Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training (CNATT) Detachment Tinker at Tinker Air Force Base (AFB), Oklahoma.  Work will be accomplished at Tinker AFB, OK and at contractor facilities as described below.  The E-6B Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) airplane is a Navy configured Boeing 707-320 aircraft. A firm-fixed price (FFP) contract with an 8 – 10 year period of performance is anticipated.  Details regarding this requirement are provided in the paragraphs that follow.

The Government requires the following services for pilot and aircrew training:  
	
1)	Contract Instruction.  The Contractor shall provide flight crew instruction for the E-6B TACAMO aircraft that meets established flight crew qualification standards upon completion of training.  VQ-7 utilizes contract instructors to teach training courses from the podium/lecture, perform as flight trainer instructor/operators, facilitate training in the Learning Resource Center, and act as subject matter experts for development of future courseware revisions.  Types of training courses required include Initial Qualification Training (IQT) for pilots and flight engineers, Instructor Upgrade Training (IUT) for instructor pilots and instructor flight engineers, Initial and Refresher Crew Resource Management (CRM) Training for flight and mission crew students, E-6 Instrument Ground School, and E-6 Refresher Training.  Approximate annual student throughput for pilot training courses required is 40 students.  

2)	Flight Engineers.  Currently the In-Flight Training (IFT) program utilizes Boeing 737 commercial aircraft acting as surrogate E-6 TACAMO aircraft to train flight crews in a flying phase following ground training.  Flight engineers fly aboard the IFT aircraft to ensure student pilots are immersed in the same environment they would experience if they were aboard an E-6 aircraft.  The contractor is to provide sufficient flight engineer instructors to accomplish approximately 2,000 flying hours per year.

3)	E-6B Contractor Operation & Maintenance Services (COMS).  As part of the Government’s requirement, the contractor shall conduct a Navy COMS program to support resident E-6B training devices.  In this program the contractor conducts all scheduled and unscheduled maintenance to keep the training systems in a Ready for Training (RFT) state. Currently there are two Operational Flight Trainers (OFT), a Navigator Trainer (NT), a Computer-Based Trainer, and a suite of maintenance trainers. The contractor shall be provided with a Material Support Package (MSP) consisting of spare parts and data to maintain training systems.  The contractor shall replace parts consumed and provide data updates to the MSP as required.  The contractor shall maintain the logistics necessary to operate assigned school house functions and assigned training devices.

4)	E-6B COMS for E-6B Weapons System Trainer (WST).  The Navy is currently under contract with L-3 Communications Government Systems, Inc to deliver an E-6B WST.  The trainer is anticipated to be delivered in April 2006.  Following one year of Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), the WST is to be supported by COMS.  The contractor shall assume support of this new training device when the CLS period concludes.  

5)	Instructional Systems Development (ISD).  The contractor shall conduct revision and maintenance on E-6B curriculum, write new curriculum when applicable, and maintain all computer-based training (CBT) associated with this program including the computer-based trainer device (4E13).  At government discretion, an option shall be provided to assume responsibility for Maintenance Training curriculum and CBT.

6)	Training Device Modifications – When applicable, the contractor would incorporate technical changes into the training devices.  The price and schedule for trainer modifications will be negotiated as the requirements develop.  The next planned modification is a visual upgrade to the two (2) existing 2F144A OFTs with contract award projected for fiscal year 07.  For quick response modifications, the contractor shall provide on-site engineering services in support of the training devices at Tinker AFB.  The contractor shall maintain currency of the trainer configuration management, software, and hardware changes for minor deficiencies.

7)	Flying Training Phase – The flying training program is contingent on development and fielding of a contractor-owned, state-of-the-art flying training device.  The contractor shall provide high-fidelity E-6B simulator training on a fee-for-service basis utilizing the current 737 IFT curriculum.  The device required shall simulate the performance and functional operation of the E-6B aircraft and shall minimally meet FAA AC120-40B-Level D FTD certification requirements (FAA certification is not required) as adjusted by the Government.  The contractor shall provide a complete package to train a student up to check flight.  

These E-6B training courses require classroom academic, laboratory (simulator), and practical training.  To support these training courses, the contractor shall provide all certified instructors, support personnel required to operate and maintain the devices, and any additional labor required for supervising and administering classroom and simulator training.  Instructor qualifications will be provided when the solicitation is issued.

The ground phase of training will take place in the Government-furnished facility located at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, OK and the requirement for high-fidelity E-6B simulator training will be provided in a contractor-furnished facility.  The Government will provide all required course curriculums/syllabi and any additional Government-specific courseware/materials needed for the ground training of E-6B pilots and aircrewmen.  The contractor shall provide all required course curriculums/syllabi and any additional courseware/materials needed for the flying training phase of E-6B pilots and aircrewmen.

Businesses capable of accomplishing the required services are invited to submit the following:
1)	Company literature, brochures, or capability summaries.
2)	Business size (i.e., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) certified business, woman-owned business, etc).  For purposes of reporting business size, the applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 541330 with a size standard of $23.0 million.  Please identify business size on cover sheet or first page of submission.
3)	Past and/or current performance on similar contracts (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact information).  Please limit past and/or current performance to the last 3 years.

NARA is interested in having an assessment of its records handling operations to identify current weaknesses that could lead to theft or other losses of permanently valuable records in its custody and to obtain expert recommendations for improvements with likely costs for each new measure. NARA is responsible for somewhat more than 2,000,000 cubic feet of archival records of the Federal Government that are housed in two building in the Washington area.  These buildings are in the Federal triangle area of downtown Washington, DC and in College Park, Maryland; they are commonly known within NARA as Archives I and Archives II. The holdings include historical records from the 1780s to the present day that document major Government programs, wars, and many of the most important movements and events in American history.  They include records from all three branches of the Federal Government.  They are in a wide variety of media including textual paper records, motion pictures, video tapes, sound recordings, maps and charts, still photographs, and electronic records on tapes and hard drives. NARA is responsible for the preservation of these holdings, for describing the records in order to facilitate access, and for making them available to interested researchers.  Some of these researchers are served through written correspondence, through the NARA web site and through reproduction orders via mail in and online fee orders.  But many researchers come to the NARA research rooms in the two buildings, where they examine and handle the records in person.  In FY 2003 these on site researchers made 33,043 visits to use microfilm and 56,922 other visits to use records in a variety of other kinds of media, but chiefly to use original textual paper records.  These researchers include historians, lawyers, genealogists, and people with many other interests. 

Security measures in place.
NARA has taken steps to minimize the vulnerability to thefts.  
The steps focusing particularly on researchers include:
•	Institution of a “clean research room” policy to control what researchers can bring into the rooms where they work with original records;
•	Introduction of cameras and re-design of the layouts in research rooms to monitor behavior of researchers more effectively; and
•	Imposition of stricter limits on researcher access to stacks that effectively keeps virtually all public researchers out of the stacks.

The steps focusing on staff and Contractors include:
•	Introduction of secure vaults and safes in labs as well as a secure vault for  “treasure” items;
•	Establishment of badge control access for staff in Archives II stacks, processing rooms, and preservation labs at Archives II as well as procedures for end of the day lock up checks of stacks and specially protected areas at Archives I;
•	Scheduling of annual inspections and inventories of the vaults and safes where records needing special protection are stored; and
•	Imposition of requirements for reporting valuable items in open files and for reporting missing records and security violations.

Other steps that focus on better control of the records, include:
•	Improvments in the tracking of records loaned for exhibits, including adopting a new database;
•	Clarification of the procedures for the physical transporting of records between NARA facilities; and
•	Development of guidance for handling and protecting records during the major records moves required by the construction of Archives II and the renovation of Archives I.

Continuing concerns.
Despite these measures NARA is concerned about the possibility of a continuing vulnerability to theft and is interested in a loss prevention survey to better understand its vulnerabilities and to improve its security measures.

Overview of facilities and work processes.
The archival holdings of NARA are kept in storage rooms commonly called stacks in the two buildings.  Archives I opened in the 1930s and has recently been undergoing a major renovation.  Archives II opened in the 1990s.  There are about 112 relatively small stacks in Archives I with holdings capacities ranging from 2,000 cubic feet to 12,000 cubic feet and 28 very large stacks in Archives II with holding capacities ranging from 13,000 to 110,000 cubic feet.  The NARA staff works in the stacks to locate records relevant to answer researchers’ inquiries and to describe records. They bring records from the stacks to the research rooms for use by onsite researchers.  The staff also brings records from the stacks to processing areas to work on arranging and describing the records; these processing locations are sometimes work spaces within stacks at Archives I or separate rooms at Archives I and II.  Some processing of records may also occur in office space.  Some records are also taken to preservation labs for microfilming and other types of preservation work.  Access to the stacks, processing rooms, and labs is controlled by keys issued to staff at Archives I and by coded badges issued to staff at Archives II.  There are plans to convert from key to badge controls at Archives I if adequate funding is obtained during the next 2 – 3 fiscal years. When records are removed from the stacks for transfer to either the processing rooms or office areas for work by staff or the research rooms for use by researchers, there is a paper trail of forms that are filled out to show the stack location of the records, the destination of the records, the persons moving and receiving the records, and the dates of the movements.  The quantities involved in these moves that are tracked via this paper work trail can be as much as a full cart containing up to 21 archives boxes equaling circa 7 cubic feet or as little as one pension file or a few letters that are placed in a small envelope. In the research rooms, there is a procedure that requires the researcher to sign for the records and return them when finished or when the room closes each day.  Each research room has staff monitoring the use of the records by the researchers and contract guards that inspect the possession of researchers at exit points.  The clean research room approach prevents researchers from bringing into the rooms many personal belongings or equipment, unless approved by the staff.  At Archives I, there are two main rooms where original records are used by the public as well as a microfilm reading room.  At Archives II there are five rooms where original records are used by the public, as well as a microfilm reading room.  Between October 2003, and August 2004, more than 340,000 items were provided to approximately 49,000 researchers. A large percentage of the NARA staff has access to records in one or more of these locations and functions.  In March 2004, there were about 730 permanent employees in the NARA Office of Records Services (NW) and another 120 student temporary employees.  Of the permanent employees approximately 340 - 360 have stack access and about 72 work in the preservation labs.  Another 60 – 70 permanent and student employees work in the branches that operate the research rooms in both buildings.  Between October 2003 and August 2004, NW staff members accessed stack areas more than 33,000 times.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a  Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Design and Build of 3 ea. prototype miniature spectrographs for space applications. 		   STATEMENT OF WORK Design and build three prototype miniature spectrographs for use in space applications. Below are the specifications for the spectrographs. 1. Develop three spectrographs each with a different spectral region and input aperture as follows: a. Region 1 (VIS) 350-1000nm b. Region 2 (NIR) 900-1700 nm c. Region 3 (SWIR) 1600-2500 nm. d. Note: These wavelengths are assumed exclusive; i.e. not inclusive; the chief ray of end wavelengths strike the end points of the specified detector length. A spot of this wavelength is not completely resolved. 2. Detector: Three separate commercially available detectors have been identified for use with the spectrographs. a. VIS channel use Hamamatsu S8377-256Q. 256, 50µm x 250µm pixels = 12.8 mm total array length. b. NIR channel use Hamamatsu G9201-256S. 256, 50µm x 250µm pixels = 12.8 mm total array length. c. SWIR channel use Hamamatsu G9208-256W. 256, 50µm x 250µm pixels= 12.8 mm total array length. 3. Entrance slit: 50µm wide x 250µm tall. 4. Required spectral resolution (slit image FWHM): a. VIS channel !10 nm (15 nm at 365 nm) b. NIR channel !10 nm c. SWIR channel !10-20 nm (must be ! 20 nm @ 2500 nm) 5. Numeric aperture " 0.13 6. Grating peak efficiency near these wavelengths: a. VIS peaked at 600 nm b. NIR peaked at 1400 nm c. SWIR peaked at 2400 nm. 7. Thermal excursion ranges: a. Operational –70 - + 50 ° C. b. Storage –100 - +100 ° C. 8. Maximum package size and mass: a. Each spectrograph must have a mass ! 50 grams. b. Each spectrograph package footprint (detector excluded) should fit within a volume of 2 inches x 2 inches x 2 inches. 9. Other Package Requirements a. Each spectrograph must be light tight. b. Must accommodate either a SMA fiber optic input or a 12.4mm diameter optic, barrel mounted, with a 3/4-inch diameter bolt circle flange. Total flange diameter will not exceed 1 inch. c. Using screws, it must be possible to fasten each spectrometer to a flat plate. A nut and bolt arrangement or screws threaded into the housing are acceptable configurations. Proposed Project Steps 1. Technical specification finalization and optical modeling refinement. 2. Input interface approval. 3. Conformance testing plan approval. 4. Grating design and fabrication (three different grating designs) 5. Update predicted as-built resolution after tolerance analysis. 6. Spectrograph mechanical design ( Common enclosure, 3 detector mounts). 7. Fabrication of prototypes (one spectrograph for each spectral range) 8. Integration, test, performance verification, and delivery of three prototype spectrographs with as-built performance report including dimensioned drawings. 9. Deliver one of each type, VIS, NIR and SWIR spectrometer, no later than April 4, 2005. Preferred performance specifications 1. Make the input slit interchangeable 2. Design the spectrograph housings so they can be “stacked” and fastened together as an integrated unit. 3. Maximum change in irradiance at pixel over operational temperature ! 1000 ppm/°C. 4. Allow for an order sorting filter to be mounted immediately behind the input aperture (between the slit and detector array). The mounting may simply be potting the filter in place in a recessed aperture. For design purposes, a CVI LPF 1300 long pass filter may be used for the SWIR spectrometer, and a CVI LPF 850 for the NIR spectrometer. The nominal thickness of these filters is 3.5-4.5 mm, with an effective index of 1.8. Specific details of the filters are available from the manufacturer. The diameter of the filters may be specified by the Contractor and furnished by NASA GRC for integration in the final units. No sorting filter is required for the VIS spectrometer. Government Furnished Property: The filters described in the preferred performance specifications section 4, will be supplied to the Contractor and will be returned as part of the integrated deliverable.  In order to optimize assembly and testing, NASA GRC will supply each of the required detectors (Hamamatsu S8377-256Q, Hamamatsu G9201-256S and Hamamatsu G9208-256W), appropriate readout electronics, and technical support to readout the detector arrays during the alignment and mounting process. Each of these arrays will be fixed to the spectrographs and returned to NASA GRC as part of the deliverable. In the case of the Hamamatsu S8377-256Q (silicon photodiode array), the detector will be mounted to a small circuit board with 4 mounting holes with #2 screw clearance. The other two detector arrays will be mounted using the existing mounting flange on the parts. The provisions and clauses in the RFP  are those in effect through FAC 01-22.

IR1052-01-001 ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER (EFT) PAYMENTS  

Effective May 1, 2002, in order to receive payments under this contract/award, contractors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Beginning October 1, 2002, CCR will be the primary database used to obtain contractor information for all Federal Government contracts. Contractors can complete the on-line CCR registration process by accessing http://www.ccr.gov.  Annual renewal of a contractor's registration is a requirement.  There are mandatory fields in CCR that need to be completed before the registration can become active.  For example, contractor business, name, address, telephone, point of contact, business start date, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number (plus 4 digits, if applicable), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) account numbers to permit receipt of electronic payments, are all mandatory fields.  Registration via the internet can generally be activated within 48 hours, if all the information is complete and accurate.  Registration via another method can take up to 30 days.

The CCR web site contains information and a telephone number (800-333-0505) where a contractor can call to get an expedited DUNS number, in order to start the registration process. Contractors must obtain the EFT account numbers from its own financial institution, if not already known.  Contractors will be ineligible for awards, if they are not registered in CCR, unless they meet an exception or apply for a waiver.  Contractors requesting a waiver from CCR registration must apply via the Contracting Officer.  Only the Bureau Chief Procurement Officer (BCPO) can approve a waiver from CCR registration and permit the award action, if the contractor is not registered in CCR. Any contractor meeting an exception or obtaining a waiver from CCR registration is still required to get an EFT account in order to receive electronic payments, in accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act.  Contractors shall then submit a completed Automated Clearing House (ACH) Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form (formerly SF 3881) directly to:
Internal Revenue Service
Office of Financial Applications Support and Technology
P. O. Box 3339,
Cincinnati, Ohio 45201-3339
Or Fax to:  (513) 263-5020

The ACH Vendor/Miscellaneous Payment Enrollment Form can be obtained from the IRS Contracting Officer or from the IRS Office of Financial Applications Support and Technology, points of contact, Joan Aker or Nancy Estep at (513) 263-5069/5055, if not included in this solicitation/award.

In order for contractor invoices to be determined proper and payments made under applicable awards, contractor EFT information must be valid and current.  Valid contractor EFT information must include the Agency information; the Payee/Company information including Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN); and the Contractor's financial institution information, including the nine-digit routing transit number, account type and account number.  If the contractor is registered in CCR, changes can be made to its business profile at any time.  Under this award, if any changes are made to the mandatory business information in CCR, the contractor is required to notify the IRS Beckley Finance Office within three (3) business days.  Under this award, those contractors not registered in CCR but enrolled in EFT payments, are also required to report any changes to their business information to the IRS Beckley Finance Office within three (3) business days.  Contractors can e-mail notification of their changed CCR and EFT business information directly to: CFOBFC.CCRPaymentinformation@irs.gov

Valid contractor EFT payment information is required in order for the Government to make any payment under this award. Invoices received prior to the receipt of valid EFT information shall be deemed improper for the purpose of prompt payment under this award and payments will be rejected or suspended.  Contractors may only request a waiver from EFT payments if they meet one of the criteria listed on the Request for Waiver of Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Payment Form.  The waiver request form can be obtained via the Contracting Officer or the IRS Office of Financial Applications Support and Technology at telephone (513) 263-5069/5055 or e-mail Nancy.V.Estep@irs.gov or Joan.Aker@irs.gov.  Waivers from EFT Payments are only granted by the IRS Office of Financial Applications Support and Technology and contractors must obtain the waiver from EFT payments, prior to award being made.

 IR1052-01-002 PAID SYSTEM  

Access On-line Payment Information.  The U. S. Department of Treasury, Financial Management's Payment Advice Internet Delivery (PAID) system provides contractors with invoice payment information included with an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payment made via the Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment system.
