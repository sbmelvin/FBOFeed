<DESC>Posting (Brief Abstract):  Market Survey Capability Assessment for Runway Status Lights (RWSL) system. This is a follow up to the RWSL Public Announcement dated 8/23/07. The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or request for proposal (RFO) of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the responses to the market survey. Therefore, any costs associated with the market survey submission are solely at the interested vendor's expense. If the vendor replied to the previous RWSL Public Announcement dated 8/23/07 said vendor need not reply to this market survey.  The FAA may decide to set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.  The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and 8(a) certified firms capable of providing the RWSL system. This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or 8(a) certified firms.  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334511 - Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing within Sector 33 - Manufacturing (Metals, Machinery, Computer, Electronics, Electrical Transportation Equipment, Furniture, Miscellaneous), with a size standard of 750 employees.  In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested industry participants: 1.	Capability Statements: This document should identify the following (not to exceed 10 pages in length) 	a. Type of services provided by your firm, b. Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance as follows).  	    -Provide a synopsis of experience gained with systems that form part of the National Airspace System and familiarity with NAS requirements  	    -Provide a synopsis of experience gained in the area of software development and integration particularly suited to interfacing separate systems, which when linked, provide expanded capabilities. 	    -Provide a synopsis describing experience gained in performing and management of construction projects within airport grounds and in particular the airport movement area (runways and taxiways). 	    -Provide a synopsis of experience gained in the development, testing, manufacturing, installation, and life cycle sustainment of complex electronic systems.   	c. Number of years in business 2.	Geographical areas where your company can provide service 3.	Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc). Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.  Respondents are encouraged to review the RWSL Statement of Work (SOW) included as part of the RWSL Public Announcement dated 2/4/08. Please note that respondents should not include any information deemed proprietary. Also note that information requested herein, or responding to this announcement will not result in the elimination of any industry participant from further consideration.  Interested firms are required to submit a Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable. ALL RESPONDENTS TO THIS MARKET SURVEY MUST BE RECEIVED BY 12:00PM ON FEBRUARY 22, 2008. All replies must be submitted via hard copy or email to the address noted below.

Currently, 3008 active OCC employees are eligible to contribute to the plan, with 2669 actively contributing to regular deferral, catch-up and Roth accounts. The cumulative OCC employee balance for the fund is in excess of $124M. Effective 1/20/2008, the OCC implemented an automatic enrollment for all new hires.

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

Notice for filing agency protests: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax:  (202) 475-3904. POC for this action is Bill Kingsley, (252)384-7283.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a 3-DIMENSIONAL IMAGING FLASH LIDAR SYSTEM that includes an integrated hybrid Focal Plane Array (FPA) detector and Readout Integrated Circuit (ROIC), a transmitter laser, transmit and receive optical system, image acquisition processor, display software and hardware, and a liquid circulating chiller for operation in high-temperature environments.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS, 305 E HALEY ST, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93101. In a previous COMPETITION, NASA Langley acquired a Flash Lidar from Advanced Scientific Concepts, Inc optimized for HDA function.  This system is currently being prepared for a demonstration test from a low flying helicopter. The main difference between a Flash Lidar optimized for medium range hazard detection and avoidance function (we refer to as HDA Lidar) and the one optimized for long range Terrain Relative Navigation (we refer to as TRN Lidar) is the field of view of the transmit/receive optics.  For the HDA lidar, the field of view is wide and all the focal plane array pixels are used. While for the TRN Lidar, the field of view is narrowed and a fraction of the focal plane array pixels are used in order to increase the lidar operational range.   The purpose of this procurement is to obtain a similar Flash Lidar with the necessary modification for performing the TRN function.  This second unit will be tested by an aircraft flight test. Future plans include integration of the two HDA and TRN functions into a single lidar system.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 13, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Corporate Franchise Data Center - Austin, 1615 Woodward Street, Austin, TX 78772 intends a sole source award to Internet 2 for the Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology's participation in the Internet2 Affiliate Membership and collaboration site status for 12 months from date of award. Authroity to award the sole source procurement can be found at 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B), 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3)(B), or FAR 6.302-3 (ii) To establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center; or maintain active engineering, research, or development work.  Internet2 is a consortium led by the higher education and research community in the U.S. that maintains an advanced high performance computer network.  Its focus is to provide leading-edge network capabilities to its members and unique partnership opportunities that facilitate the development, deployment, and use of revolutionary Internet technologies, such as the (OMB) mandated Internet protocol, IPv6. A unique qualification of the Internet2 network is that is fully supports the IPv6 protocol, and provides a testing bed for VA's implementation of this new technology.  Additionally, many of VA's academic affiliates as well as Federal agencies (e.g. National Institutes of Health) are members of the consortium.  Connecting to the Internet2 network allows computer network traffic between VA and these institutions to travel over Internet2 rather than traversing the Internet, and may improve traffic flow to/from the Internet.  Furthermore, the Internet2 network can support extremely large volumes of data transfer at very high speeds (1 Gigabit or more) not available from other Internet providers and that may be required by increasingly sophisticated and specialized multimedia applications.  The consortium has projects and programs developing and testing these types of applications (e.g. telepresence) in several areas including education and healthcare.  Internet2 is also working with the Federal Communications Commission on the Federal Rural Healthcare Pilot Program, an enhanced funding initiative intended to help public and non-profit health care providers construct state- and region-wide broadband networks to provide telehealth and telemedicine services.  With other Federal agencies, such as Indian Health Services participating, this project may help VA improve delivery of remote healthcare services and enhance VA data sharing capabilities. Market research was conducted in the form of online searches, and contacting other Government agencies, users of the service, and the Internet2 network.  The Internet2 network can support extremely large volumes of data transfer at very high speeds (1 Gigabit or more) not available over other Internet providers and that may be required by increasingly sophisticated and specialized multimedia applications.  Internet2 supports other agencies such as the Indian Health Services, Federal Communications Commission, connection to which is not available through other Internet providers.   Internet2 is an organization instituted primarily to support the academic and research communities in the U.S.  Their mission is to provide the infrastructure to help these communities develop the new technologies and applications.  The intent of VA is to use its membership in these organizations to do research and further explore new networking capabilities and applications that can be applied in VA lines of business, including healthcare delivery and education of its workforce.  Formal membership may further support research projects already underway between VA staff and other Internet2 members because of enhanced network connectivity and a general awareness campaign by both VA and Internet2. Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received by 3:00pm est on February 11, 2008. Third part firms will be considered only if responding with clear and convincing evidence that the firm has been granted rights to provide the services being procured. The determination to open competition based on responses is solely with in the discretion of the Government. If a solicitation is issued, no additional synopsis will be published. Responses should be emailed to kari.cozzens@va.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

THE IVHMS KIT CONSISTS OF THE INTEGRATED VEHICLE HEALTH MANAGEMENT UNIT (IVHMU), SENSORS FOR DIAGNOSTICS AND ROTOR SMOOTHING, AND ASSOCIATED ITEMS.   THE IVHMS INCLUDES THE REMOTE DATA CONCENTRATOR (RDC), WHICH PROVIDES ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL (A/D) DATA CONVERSION CRUCIAL TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONDITION BASED MAINTENANCE (CBM) ON NON-BUSED (UH-60A/L) AIRCRAFT.  THE ABSENCE OF A DIGITAL DATA BUS MEANS THAT A DEVICE LIKE THE RDC IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE DIGITAL DATA COMMUNICATION AND PROCESSING.  CBM IS MAINTENANCE BASED UPON EVIDENCE OF NEED.  THAT EVIDENCE IS ACQUIRED BY ONBOARD SYSTEMS, LIKE IVHMS, AND PROCESSED OFF AIRCRAFT BY SYSTEMS THAT ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE ARMY LOGISTICS ENTERPRISE INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE PURPOSE OF CBM IS TO REDUCE THE MAINTENANCE BURDEN AND THE ?LOGISTICS FOOTPRINT? OF FIELDED SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY LEGACY SYSTEMS LIKE THE UH-60A/L, SO THAT THEY CAN BE AFFORDABLY SUSTAINED. THE IVHMU INCLUDES AN INTEGRATED COCKPIT VOICE/FLIGHT DATA RECORDER (CV/FDR) AND UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC LOCATING BEACON (UALB).  THE DEPLOYMENT SPARES PACKAGE WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE FIELDING SUPPORT TO COMBAT AVIATION BRIGADES (CABS).  THE GSE KITS ARE REQUIRED FOR IVHMS OPERATION AND CALIBRATION. BECAUSE THESE ITEMS WILL BE UTILIZED TO SUPPORT THE VEHICLE HEALTH MONITORING AND CRASH SURVIVABILITY OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN DEPLOYED UH-60A/L BLACK HAWK AIRFRAMES, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE AND THIS REQUIREMENT SHALL BE FILLED IN THE TIMELIEST MANNER POSSIBLE.  BELOW IS A REQUIREMENTS SCHEDULE FOR ALL KIT ITEMS: 50 IVHMS A&B KIT DELIVERY			14 MARCH 2008 3 GSE KITS DELIVERED					14 MARCH 2008 6 GSE KITS DELIVERED					15 MAY 2008 SPARES PACKAGE DELIVERED				15 JUNE 2008 THIS ITEM IS RESTRICTED TO SIMMONDS PRECISION PRODUCTS, INCORPORATED (D/B/A GOODRICH), FOUR COLISEUM CENTRE, 2730 WEST TYVOLA ROAD, CHARLOTTE, NC 28217.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT POSSESS SUFFICIENT, ACCURATE OR LEGIBLE DATA TO PURCHASE THIS PART FROM OTHER THAN THE CURRENT SOURCE.  IVHMS IS APPROVED FOR USE ON UH-60A/L AIRCRAFT VIA THE AIRWORTHINESS RELEASE (AWR) PROCESS, AND HAS COMPLETED NINETY-FIVE PERCENT (95%) OF THE TESTING REQUIRED FOR FULL AIRWORTHINESS QUALIFICATION.  THERE IS NO OTHER SYSTEM THAT IS QUALIFIED OR APPROVED VIA AWR WHICH MEETS THE UTILITY HELICOPTERS PROJECT OFFICE (UHPO) REQUIREMENTS FOR CBM, INCLUDING FLIGHT REGIME RECOGNITION, WHICH IS A CRITICAL IVHMS CAPABILITY REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE CBM.  IN ORDER TO SUPPORT DEPLOYING NATIONAL GUARD AIRCRAFT, TIME AND FUNDING ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP AND QUALIFY A NEW SYSTEM.  DURING DEPLOYMENTS TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, IVHMS EQUIPPED UNITS HAVE OPERATED THEIR AIRCRAFT AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER OPERATIONAL READINE!  SS RATES IN HIGH OPERATIONAL TEMPO (OPTEMPO) ENVIRONMENTS THAN NON-EQUIPPED UNITS.  ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302-1, OTHER INTERESTED SOURCES MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT A PROPOSAL.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  HOWEVER, ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES THAT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WILL BE GIVEN DUE CONSIDERATION BY THE GOVERNMENT.

<SUBJECT>R -- R - Charter of Commercial Longline Fishing Vessels for Evaluation of Bluefin Tuna Mitigation Measures
<SOLNBR>WC133F-08-RQ-0198SLW
<RESPDATE>021808
<CONTACT>Sharon Walker, Contract Specialist, Phone (816)426-7470      , Fax 816) 426-7530, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Marine Fisheries, has a requirement to charter two commercial longline fishing vessels for evaluation of Bluefin Tuna Mitigation Measures. The Contractor shall provide longline vessels with the equipment; captain and crew; fuel; bait; food and berthing accommodations equal to that of the crew for one Fishery Observer; and all other necessary material. Pelagic longline fisheries for tuna and swordfish catch several non-target species such as blue and white marlin, sharks, and bluefin tuna, which are managed under international rebuilding plans and are experiencing overfishing.  The bycatch of these species by pelagic longline fisheries is of concern to management agencies and the U.S. has implemented several time/area closures in an effort to reduce bycatch mortality of these species in U.S. fisheries.  Current closures include areas off of New Jersey, the DeSoto Canyon in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), the Florida east coast, and the Charleston Bump. These fisheries also impact protected species such as leatherback and loggerhead sea turtles and the U.S has implemented mandatory gear changes and fishing restrictions to mitigate the incidental capture and mortality of these species.  Time/area closures can be effective in reducing bycatch mortality of some species, but can have a significant effect on target catch rates and economic impact on the fishery and can in some cases increase bycatch mortality due to redirected fishing effort. 
The Government proposes to conduct scientific research in consultation and cooperation with the domestic pelagic longline fleet in the Gulf of Mexico.  The objective of the research will be to conduct a pilot study to develop and assess the efficacy of new technologies and changes in fishing practices in reducing the bycatch mortality of bluefin tuna in the directed yellowfin tuna fishery. The proposed work is a continuation of research conducted by the Harvesting Systems Branch in April, 2007 to examine ?weak link? concepts which would allow bluefin tuna to escape capture on pelagic longlines, while retaining yellowfin tuna. 
The Contractor shall conduct a total of 50 sets of longline gear per vessel throughout the study period from date of award through June 2008.  
Research being conducted in 2008 through this contract is to investigate the potential of experimental hooks as additional method of preventing bluefin capture.  Fishery dependent data will be collected by contracting two pelagic longline yellowfin tuna vessels possessing Federal permits for the Gulf of Mexico yellowfin tuna fishery. All fishing activities must be in compliance with the applicable regulations at 50 CFR part 635, except as modified by the terms and conditions of the ESA Section 10 Permit and of the Exempted Fishing Permit to be issued under the authority of 50 CFR 635.32. 
Minimum Requirements for Vessels: U.S. vessels shall possess current, valid, limited-access permits for Atlantic Tunas Longline, Atlantic Swordfish (Incidental or Directed), and Atlantic Sharks (Directed or Incidental).  Vessels not registered in the U.S. shall meet all specifications, conduct and communicate all business and fishing operations in English, agree to abide by all regulations under 50 CFR 635 and demonstrate prior to each trip that Bluefin Tuna quota is available from the country of vessel registry.  Vessels shall be capable of embarking a Government-designated Fishery Observer.  When carrying a Fishery Observer, the vessel shall meet the vessel safety requirements at 50 CFR 600.746(c) and the accommodation and access requirements at 50 CFR 635.7(e).
The vessel shall be suitable for rough water work with a minimum length overall (LOA) of 70 feet. The vessel shall carry sufficient fuel, water and food stores to remain at sea for at least 25 days. The vessel must be equipped with required turtle rescue equipment and an appropriate compliment of tools and spare parts necessary to maintain general vessel and fishing operations for at least 25 days at sea.
Vessel shall have a minimum of 10 cu. ft. of cold storage space (ice hold space) for storage of scientific specimens.
 A minimum of one head including shower shall be available, with soap, toilet paper, and paper towels being provided by the vessel owner.
 Vessel shall have a shaded, protected, restrictive, and well-ventilated area where any turtle brought on board the vessel can be covered with a moist cloth.  Vessel owner may construct a square made of 2x4s or 4x4s to contain any captured turtles.
 The vessel shall comply with all guidelines for handling, resuscitation, and release of sea turtles required by fishery management regulations for Atlantic Ocean longline vessels.  The vessel shall carry all equipment (e.g. dip net, line cutter) required by those regulations. 
The vessel shall pass a USCG safety examination or inspection, or the equivalent from the country of registry, which must meet the U.S. standards, at a minimum.

Vessel Operator Knowledge Requirements: The Vessel Operator shall have a minimum of six (6) years experience as vessel captain within the last ten (10) year period in the Northern GOM and demonstrate (logbook data) having conducted at least 5 fishing trips, catching at least 100 Yellowfin Tuna per trip. More experience will be given more consideration.
Vessel Operators fluent in both English and Vietnamese are preferable; however, the Vessel Operator must be fluent in English, at a minimum.  
The Vessel Operator shall be knowledgeable of U.S. and international fishery regulations and reporting requirements and shall be familiar with all aspects of this contract.
 This is a small business set-aside. The NAICS code for this action is 114111. 
 Request for Quotation documents will be available on or about February 11, 2008.

Appraisals are required for the purchase of conservation easements under the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), the Healthy Forests Reserve Program (HFRP), and the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP).  The purpose of the appraisal is to provide an opinion of market value of the entire subject property (larger parcel) before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the entire subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value.  The appraiser shall recognize that in a before and after appraisal, the partial interest being acquired is not actually being appraised.  What is appraised is the larger parcel before and after the conveyance of the partial interest.  Appraisals shall comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), Uniform Appraisals Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA aka Yellow Book) and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.

The contract(s) will be for a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract(s), competitively negotiated, not to exceed $500,000.  Any contract resulting from this solicitation will have a one year base period from date of award, with a possible four one year renewal option period(s).

Also, to be considered for award, the proposing firm must have an office located within the State of Arkansas, or within 100 miles of an Arkansas border.  A quick response is required to meet program deadlines and failure to provide a quick response could jeopardize Arkansas NRCS programs.

This procurement is 100% set-aside for small business.  The associated NAICS code is 531320 and the small business size standard of $2 million will be used.  

The following evaluation factors will be used to evaluate offers for award, and are listed in descending order of importance.  1) Past Performance, including timeliness and quality of work; 2) Capacity to accomplish work, including evaluation of staff appraisers and subcontractors; and 3)  Technical Competence/Experience.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are approximately equal to cost or price.

For planning purposes, the Government anticipates approximately 40 appraisals to be completed for the base year and each renewal year.  The Government reserves the right to award more than one contract for a period of up to one year after the proposal due date.  Proposal prices are effective for 90 days from the proposal due date, unless extended by the offeror.

Technical reviews will be conducted on the first appraisal of each fiscal year, and on approximately 10 percent of all subsequent appraisals completed by each individual appraiser.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration has a need to contract for financial advisory services for the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program. Pursuant to the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA), Title I, Subtitle E, Chapter 1 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), Public Law 105-178 (23 U.S.C. 181-189), the Department of Transportation (DOT) is authorized to provide credit assistance to major surface transportation projects, including secured (direct) loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit to project sponsors (Borrowers) of major surface transportation projects for up to 33% of eligible project costs.  Projects may include highway, transit, passenger rail and intermodal facilities.  Generally, under current law, projects must cost at least $50 million.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on behalf of the DOT, seeks to award multiple financial advisory task order contracts to several qualified firms with project financial analysis expertise in the municipal bond and private lender sectors to assist the DOT in two phases of activity with respect to TIFIA loan applications. 

Phase 1 (Project Evaluation):  Evaluate the soundness and creditworthiness of the applicant?s financial plan for the project; and

Phase 2 (Project Negotiation):  As part of a DOT team that includes DOT staff, attorneys and outside counsel, provide support in negotiating the financial terms of credit agreements to be entered into with Borrowers, for those projects selected to receive assistance.

Both phases will involve extensive financial analysis, including, but not limited to, the evaluation of proposed credit structures, calculation of debt service coverage ratios, development of alternative TIFIA debt repayment structures, review of feasibility studies, and provision of computer analysis and modeling support.

The firm must be able to attend working conferences and meetings at DOT headquarters in Washington, D.C. as well as participate in telephone conference calls often on short notice..

It is anticipated that each contractor will be assigned one to five projects (task orders) to evaluate annually, depending upon the level of demand for program assistance.  For each project/task order, DOT will select one firm from among the multiple firms it retains to advise it on each transaction.  Although every project assigned to a contractor will involve the performance of work under Phase 1, the performance of work under Phase 2 will be limited to only those applicants selected by the DOT to receive TIFIA assistance.

Extensive information on the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) can be accessed through the websitehttp://www.tifia.fhwa.dot.gov/


The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date.

The firm will also review all loan closing documentation and be responsible for or represent as appropriate the TIFIA JPO at financial close (generally held simultaneously with senior creditors) and may from time to time be required to furnish legal memoranda which would be incorporated into a briefing memoranda making recommendations with regard to the execution of the TIFIA credit agreement by the Department.

The firm must be able to attend working conferences and meetings at DOT headquarters in Washington, D.C. on short notice as well as participate in telephone conference calls on short notice.

NAVAIR has scheduled an Industry Day for 12 February 2008 from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm at the Frank Knox Building, VIP Room, Patuxent River, Maryland.  The Frank Knox Building is located just outside gate 2 with the entrance south of gate 2.  Access to the base is not required. This Industry Day is open to all interested parties. The intent of this Enterprise Architecture (EA) Center of Excellence (COE) Industry Day is to provide our Industry partners with an opportunity to learn more about the Navy?s focus on information delivery in a network-enabled environment and the direction NAVAIR is taking towards the development of architectural artifacts.   While careful and strategic planning goes into the design, an enterprise architecture actually emerges as a result of implementing individual projects; therefore, it is critical that NAVAIR programs develop their DoDAF views and ISPs using a defined set of recognized tools and templates.  This will ensure interoperability with other programs and demonstrate how these architectural artifacts decompose from overarching architectures.  The COE exemplifies the new collaborative business model ? multi-agency shared services delivery models.  Learn more about the EA COE vision and the perceived way forward in architecture development for NAVAIR.

The capability statement package shall be sent by mail to the following address:  Department of the Navy, Contracts Department, Code 251521, Building 441, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, 21983 Bundy Road, Unit 7, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1463; or via email linda.p.nelson@navy.mil; or by facsimile to (301) 757-6516.  Submissions must be received at the office and cited no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EDT) on 28 February 2008.  Questions or comments regarding this notice may be addressed electronically to Linda Nelson at linda.p.nelson@navy.mil.  No phone calls will be accepted or returned.

<DESC>The date and time set for receipt of documents in response to this announcement is hereby extended to February 27, 2008 at 4:00 PM MST. Selection Criteria E, LOCATION, is hereby changed to read:  Location in the general geographic area of the projects and knowledge of the locality of the projects, provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, so that personnel involved in field investigations and operations possess necessary knowledge of requirements and laws of the area. The following are the official responses to questions posed by potential offerors.  Any future questions may or may not be answered at the Government's discretion.  However the due date set for receipt of documents will not be extended unless the Government determines such questions warrant further extension of the due date set for receipt of documents. Q.  The synopsis on the front page states "Set Aside: N/A" however there is some verbiage in the description that is confusing.  That verbiage is: "One award is being solicited on an unrestricted basis pursuant to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, and one award is being solicited as a 100% Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set aside."  Can you clarify for me whether this solicitation is or is not set aside for SBE and/or Veteran's Owned Small Business? A.  There will be two awards made as a result of this solicitation.  One award is being solicited on an unrestricted basis (open to both large & small businesses), and one is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set aside. Q.  I guess I'm still a bit confused because of "pursuant to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program."  My company does not qualify as a small business.  A.  Below is an excerpt from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) that pertains to the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  The purpose of the Program is to --(a) Assess the ability of small businesses to compete successfully in certain industry categories without competition being restricted by the use of small business set-asides.  Refer to FAR Part 19.10.  As a large business, you may still submit under the unrestricted solicitation. Q.  Will an engineering lead firm, for example structural engineering, with an architectural subcontractor, and the other required disciplines as subcontractors, be considered, or must the lead firm be architectural? A.  In accordance with FAR Part 36.601-4 (b)"Contracting officers may award contracts for architect-engineer services to any firm permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering."   Q.  I would just like to know if this would result in a Firm Fixed Price contract, or Time and Materials. A.  The contracts will be Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with firm fixed hourly labor rates.  Individual task orders will then be issued against the base contract. Q.  Is there anyone currently performing these services?  Or is this a new requirement? A.  There are currently two IDIQ contracts in place; one with Carter & Burgess, Inc, and one with Roesling Nakamura Architects. Q.  Can you provide specific projects as examples of the types of work that will be covered under this IDIQ contract? A.  The types of projects, and work required to be performed, is contained in the synopsis.  As this is an IDIQ contract, specific project information is not available at this time. Q.  Criteria D. Past Performance- The solicitation asks for "...examples of project specific work for your five most recent projects..."  Does this mean that you only want to see 5 projects total in Section F. of the SF 330?  Or can we submit more in Section F.? A.  Submit five only. Q.  For the unrestricted contract, if a large company is the prime, are there small business sub-contracting goals?  Will the large business be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan prior to award? A.   Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with the SF 330 packages.  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) targeted subcontracting goals for the participation of small business concerns are as follows:  Small Business Concerns 15%; HUBZone Small Business Concerns 5%; Small Disadvantaged Concerns 5%; Women-Owned Business Concerns 6%; Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns 3%; Veteran Owned Small Business Concerns 3%.

<DESC>Purpose of Modification 1 to original synopsis was to correct the address of the PTAG.

February 7, 2008

I. 	Requirement

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has a requirement for Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) investigation services. These investigations pertain to employee complaints related to employment discrimination and are governed by Title 7, and as such, timeliness and thoroughness are critical to meeting the government?s statutory responsibility to resolve these matters in an expeditious manner. The complete statement of work (attachment 1) and all attachments can be downloaded at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/index.htm.	 All documents will be available at the aforementioned site by COB February 8, 2008.

The USPTO is soliciting quotes in accordance with its Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG), following simplified acquisition procedures similar to those set forth at FAR 13.5 for acquisitions of commercial items not in excess of $10 Million. The PTAG can be seen at http://www.ustpo.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/acquproc.htm.


The solicitation number is OCRBPA004, and is issued as an RFQ. This acquisition is a 100% small business set aside. The NAICS code is 561611 and the associated small business size standard is $11.5M.  

II.	Instructions

Interested quoters are requested to provide pricing in the format provided (see attachment 2) Quoters shall also provide three past performance references and contact information. The contact information shall include the company/agency name, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and email address (if possible). 

Past performance references should be for worked performed within the last three years  The USPTO will  contact the references provided but is not limited to these reference in assessing past performance. The USPTO will use all information reasonably available to it to assess past performance.

Experience should list the company/agency for which the quoter has worked, duration of assignment, and the exact nature of the work performed. 

Quotes must be received by on or before Friday, February 19, 2008 at 10:00 a.m. Questions should be addressed to Chris Harris (via email to Chris.Harris@uspto.gov), and must be received by 12:00 p.m. on Wednesday, February 14, 2008. Questions received after this may not be entertained.



III.	Evaluation

The USPTO will issue multiple BPAs. The total value is estimated to be $300,000 per year. Pursuant to FAR 16.702(C)(2) the government only estimates, but does not guarantee, the volume of purchases made through these agreements will be $300,000 nor is the government obligated to place orders with the BPA awardees. The USPTO anticipates issuing firm fixed priced BPA calls. 

The awarding of BPAs will be on a best value basis. The determination of best value will be made considering the following evaluation factors: experience, past performance, and price. However, we reserve the right to do telephone interviews.


The vast majority of the requirement pertains to individual cases with one or two issues; therefore, the evaluated price will consist of the sum of the 5 year average of Individual Cases?one issue and Individual Cases?per additional issue.


IV.	Post Award Administration

TITLE: ADVANCED COMPUTING ARCHITECTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 04-03-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800 

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 04 should be submitted by 1 July 04; FY 05 by 1 May 05; FY 06 by 1 May 06; FY 07 by 1 May 07; and, FY 08 by 1 May 08. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 6 Jan 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The intent of seeking advanced computing architectures is to explore computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by C2, ISR, and strike systems in order to establish, maintain, and exploit information superiority.  Evolution in computing performance, capacity, and adaptability will lead to extraordinary advances in warfighter capabilities and the systems they depend upon each day.  By broadening and increasing the cognitive capabilities of the computing infrastructure the advantages the warfighter has in filtering, detecting, tracking, fusion, and situational assessment can be unmatched.  Achieving, demonstrating, and fielding these cognitive advances in a constructive methodical manor is key to providing the information superiority necessary for future DoD mission success.

The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, and demonstrate advanced computing architecture technologies and applications. This effort will investigate the research, application and/or development of emerging advanced computing architecture technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas: (1) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the processing capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems. This area encompasses all information processing technology both hardware and software that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, scalability and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I processing systems. Examples of hardware technologies include data intensive processing architectures, power aware processing architectures, polymorphic processing architectures, high productivity computing systems, clockless logic, grid computing, data storage, data visualization, data busses, mobile and wireless networks. Examples of software technologies include programming languages both new and existing, data retrieval/mining, data management, data delivery, software/system monitors, publish/subscribe mechanisms, decision making techniques, distributed databases, and resource management. (2) Development of novel computing architectures that facilitate evolutionary computing (EC) methods such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Genetic Programming (GP), etc. for solving hard, NP-complete optimization problems.  Research in this area could address design tools for mapping algorithms and fitness function evaluation engines onto hardware/software systems, achieving extreme solution speeds, problem size scaling, physical miniaturization and power minimization of the physical platform.  Also of interest would be research aimed at employing EC methods to enhance and optimize the design process for composing such hardware/software systems, and applications of these technologies to specific optimization problems of interest to the Information Directorate. (3) Development of technologies supporting utilization of hybrid computation systems such as quantum or biomolecular computing combined with conventional CMOS Silicon systems. New algorithms and architectures, for interfaces between conventional electronic systems and systems based on new operations paradigms, are needed to transduce information in the most efficient manner.  This will enable development of hybrid systems with unique capabilities beyond general computing, such as intrinsic contextual addressing and computing. (4) Modeling and Simulation. Development of virtual real time modeling and simulation methods to enable more human intuitive design processes. Research in this area would focus on demonstrating extreme speed-ups of modeling and simulation engines used in present or proposed design environments, in order to achieve near real time inspection of the effect of changes made to a device or information system design.  This research area would also encompass fast methods to cast models and simulation engines into parallel and embedded processing platforms. In addition this area includes the development of simulation technology to perform rapid assessment and course of action analysis of the predictive battlespace environment. Examples of these particular technologies include: real-time simulation systems, advanced simulation architectures, M&S for wargaming, behavior representation, predictive assessment of adversarial actions, adversary intent inferencing, and application of these, or other, technologies to the concepts of dynamic planning/execution, and real-time decision support. (5) Development of hardware and software processing architectures and techniques to enhance mechanisms of intelligence leading to cognizant computing.  Examples might be learning algorithms, knowledge creation techniques, storage or computation media physically addressed by a context mechanism such as resonance or stochastic summation, or distributed processing where each of many parallel sensing devices, has its own processor that does significant data interpretation/reduction. (6) Development of information technology leading to the advancement or demonstration of autonomous systems for enabling improved situational awareness, situational management, and situational control of the battlespace. This area includes all information technology that could potentially contribute to enhancing awareness and response through processing, reconfigurability, networking, communication, teaming, and control of ground, air, and/or space platforms.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for concept developments, experiments, and demonstrations involving new and innovative approaches to support Air Force communications as it applies to Modeling and Simulation, Enterprise Management, and Networking and Communication Links for the future Airborne Network (AN). Even though the primary technology area is modeling and simulation for AN, this BAA is open to solicitations in the areas of enabling technologies for AN.

The AN is the airborne extension of the Air Force's ConstellationNet portion of the Global Information Grid (GIG). 

The AN is defined to be an infrastructure that provides communication transport services through at least one node that is on a platform capable of flight. This can best be visualized in the context of the operating domains served by the GIG.  The Transformational Communications Satellite System (TSAT) network will provide space connectivity and the GIG-Bandwidth Expansion (GIG-BE) network together with networks such as those provided under the Combat Information Transport System and Theater Deployable Communications will provide surface connectivity.  Airborne connectivity within the GIG will be provided by the AN.  The AN will connect to both the space and surface networks, making it an integral part of the communications fabric of the GIG.

The AN will differ from the existing terrestrial and space-based networks due to the unique environment. The AN will be composed of subnetworks of heterogeneous networks and links. Airborne platforms will enter and leave different subnetworks and the AN as they transit through the area at speeds of up to Mach 2. Links making up the subnetworks and the AN will consist of a collection of differing types to include point-to-point, broadcast, ad hoc, simplex plus many other kinds.         

To realize the AF vision for the AN, this extension of the GIG in the airborne domain must be easy to use, configure, and maintain and must provide:

Ubiquitous and assured network access to all Air Force platforms; 

GIG core services whose integrity is assured; 

Quality appropriate to the commander's intent and rules of engagement (ROE);

Rapid response to mission growth, emerging events and changing mission priorities; 

End-to-end interoperation with joint services, coalition, and non-DoD partners and legacy systems in all physical network domains (sub-surface, surface, airborne and space); 

The eventual AN will exist on a variety of airborne platforms.  Each air asset/platform may have a different network role within the AN:

Legacy - Airborne platforms that are equipped with legacy communications systems capable of supporting voice, tactical data link (TDL), and possibly some point-to-point Internet Protocol (IP) network connections for very limited services (e.g., email only).  The term "legacy" also includes any non-IP enabled hardware/software on any platform.

Relay/Gateway - Airborne platforms that are equipped with legacy communications systems as described for a legacy node, but also include equipment that enable them to access multiple TDLs and to relay data Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS), or transfer data formats from one link to another.

Network Access - Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which provides an IP network connection to an AN or GIG network node.  Although these nodes are tethered to the network, they do not provide any AN service to other nodes on the network.

Network Capable - Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which can join an IP data network (Tactical Subnet) and provide limited AN service (e.g., transit routing) to other nodes on that local network.     

Internetwork - Airborne platforms equipped with IP network-capable communications systems, which can access and interconnect multiple IP data networks.  These nodes are equipped with gateway and network services functionality that enable them to provide GIG services to other airborne nodes when interconnected to the GIG through a Network Service Provider node.     

Network Service Provider - Airborne platforms, fixed or deployed ground facilities, or space-based packages equipped with IP network capable communications systems, which can access multiple IP data networks.  These nodes are equipped with gateway and network services functionality that enable them to interconnect with a GIG network (e.g., Defense Information Support Network (DISN), Joint Task Force (JTF) Service Component Network, etc.) service delivery node (SDN) and to provide GIG services to other airborne nodes.     

Candidate areas of research to solve AN-unique problems or show feasibility (or non-feasibility) of solutions that will enable the eventual fielding of this capability as applied/integrated to the airborne networking environment, include, but are not limited to: 

1) Airborne Networking Modeling and Simulation: Some of the areas are: Network Centric Warfare (NCW) based AN to the current set of Air Force missions and flexible enough to adapt to emerging mission sets; AN components modeling (e.g. Link 16 and Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)); measures of effectiveness and performance assessment; Man-in-the-loop and Hardware-in-the-loop simulation and experiments, analyses of mobile communication network node's [platforms] flight-plan-adjustments [metrics, mechanisms, algorithms, and equipment] to enable the optimization of communications performance and network connectivity; dynamic ad hoc networks management; mobile IP information routing; multi-mission network centric warfare environments; analysis of alternatives; support for real-time decision-making, dynamic situation assessment, dynamic prediction, predictive assessments, operationally focused/embedded simulation, theoretical foundations of decision science, course of action analyses; AN training; develop experimental hardware and software in the laboratory and conduct experiments and demonstrations; and perform integration and validation and verification of models, simulations, enterprise management performance, airborne link and routing performance, and other solutions as required. It is expected that components will integrate into a complete M&S environment.     

2) Airborne Network Enterprise Management (EM):  This area can be broken down into six sub-areas, each with unique airborne asset considerations: event assessment, policy networking, course of action generation, mission-based understanding, cross-domain capability, and cross-cutting concerns (with includes security).     

         -     Event assessment may include the ability to "see" the status of nearby coalition, joint service or other component networks in order to obtain a larger perspective of network status.  The clustered nature of the AN, with nodes moving in and out of range of each other, will require consideration.     

         -     Policy Networking (i.e. policy-based networking) may be used to facilitate the need for manageable end-to-end, mission-based quality-of-service.     

         -     Courses of action could be generated by, but limited to, faster-than-real-time simulation, predictive network planning, established doctrine/policy, and documented response.  Course of action methods to reconfigure network nodes to compensate for an anomalous event could be based on prediction of topology and connectivity changes. 

         -     Mission understanding includes a "relative," individualized mission criticality as well as potential mapping to a larger globally accepted criticality.

         -         Cross-Domain capability:  Multi-layer security and monitoring/controlling multiple domains from a single domain based on mutual agreements.     

         -     Cross-cutting Concerns include (1) standardized methods (e.g. intelligent agents) for monitoring/managing (or tying to resident monitoring/managing capability) legacy systems; (2) Information Assurance (IA), as well as platform-based network defense, must be integrated into EM solutions; (3) Network Services should consider Domain Name Service (DNS), network time, network addressing, and service location services/protocol; (4) considerations for on-platform EM Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for inexperienced airborne operators; (5) DoD and AF projected architecture models and standards, e.g., service oriented architecture, IPv6 integration, etc.  This also includes Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES):  Application/Platform Services, Collaboration Services, Discovery Services, Enterprise Management Services, Messaging Services, Security Services, Storage Services, and User Assistance Services.

3) Airborne Networking and Communications Links:  We are looking for innovative ideas involving networking and communications links that will help enable this future capability. Such techniques and ideas may include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: methods by which nodes will address and route traffic between heterogeneous subnetworks in conditions that are dynamic, with rapidly changing network topologies; methods to alleviate the impacts upon the network of changing connectivity with links/nodes entering/leaving networks; techniques to enable traffic priority and Quality of Service (QoS) to make optimal use of the limited resources possibly including the concepts of content delivery networking (CDN) and/or content-based routing; mechanisms to enable existing and future wire-line based protocols to operate over wireless links and networks as well as the means to handle the security and information assurance problems associated with using these protocols; mechanisms to enable the use of IPv4/IPv6 (dual-stack) in coexistence; policy-based networking techniques; new high bandwidth, high quality, communications links; advanced error detection, error correction and compressions schemes; and antenna designs for improved performance on airborne platforms.

4) Information Assurance for Airborne Networking: Innovative ideas are being sought to counter cyber-threats against both network control and data cyber-security attributes suitable for low data rate, low bandwidth, limited connectivity AN Environment. These attributes include Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and non-repudiation, across the airborne network architectures. Routing across Heterogeneous RF Links and Nets, as well as connection to ground entry points in the GIG, needs to be factored in the design. Areas being sought include the understanding of the cyber threats in the AN environment, and responsive IA capability to counter such threats. This includes the testing and integration of mobile, manageable, low network overhead, IA sensors and network technology to enhance operational C2 system capabilities capable of differentiating between naturally occurring disturbances and human made, disruption, delay, destroy, deny and degradation (5Ds). Another key area is End-to-End Information Assurance performance metrics and integrated network visualization concepts.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Next Generation Sensor Concepts.  AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of advanced radar technology that will overcome deficiencies in existing and planned radar systems to detect, track, and identify aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, space debris, ground vehicles, and subsurface complexes in clutter and countermeasure environments. The survivability of new and existing systems must also be improved without the use of decoys. Upgrades to existing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Platforms and demonstrations to support transition to the next level of technology development, and evolutions to new sensors and concepts (Unmanned Air Vehicles, Space Based Platforms, etc.) need to be addressed. Sensor concepts should include multiple configurations with characteristics supporting diverse multimission requirements including Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Multiband SAR/Tomographic Imaging features, and Foliage Penetrating (FOPEN) Radar. These concepts include both Monostatic and Multistatic solutions. Lookdown Bistatic concepts should include bistatic receivers using radiators of opportunity (TV, FM etc.) with large wideband receive antennas. Areas of interest include new and innovative advances in system architectures, hardware, software and/or signal processing algorithm improvements, diverse transmit waveforms, survivability, positional estimation improvements, unique concepts in radar system design, Multi-Basing Look Down Surveillance (Air and Space), Augmentation of Reconnaissance Capabilities (development of new surveillance capabilities in Reconnaissance sensors), Ground Penetrating Radar, Bistatic/Multistatic Radar (Non-cooperative emitter stand alone sensors and Cooperative augmentation of existing ISR Platforms through UAVs), the architecture and signal processing for expendable UAV radar probes and theater missile defense. Additional technology areas include the measurement, test, analysis and modeling efforts that are required to support the development of advanced radar systems. The primary emphasis is to identify and demonstrate promising technologies for both monostatic and multistatic radar sensors in the areas of Space Time Adaptive Processing, both Adaptive and Knowledge Based (KB), Multi-Channel Signal Processing Techniques, Innovative and Wideband Processing Techniques, Multi-Dimensional Processing Techniques, Improved radar system performance developments in spread doppler clutter environment for a theater application and, in general, technologies that may significantly improve the performance of advanced radar systems. The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of increased situational awareness for ISR cross platform collaboration and cross platform cueing.

Today's intelligence operators and analysts continue to rely on solutions that are largely domain or sensor-type specific.  Additionally, the closed architectures of the various systems make the combination of each system's capabilities into a single component costly and, in some cases, not possible.  This BAA addresses the need for an open-architected and scalable solution to these issues.  The requirement is for an integrated, operator-focused, multi-intelligence knowledge association system that can ingest data from multiple ISR sensors and intelligence sources and support cross platform cueing, cross platform collaboration, Time Critical/Sensitive Targeting, strike planning, and support to overall battlefield situation awareness monitoring, and reporting and provide Situation Assessment tools that can be adapted to a variety of missions including Area of Interest monitoring and alerting; High Interest Track monitoring and alerting; and enhancing operator understanding through cross referencing known information and databases.

The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, demonstrate and transition system technologies.  This program will employ and exploit existing technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units while developing new capabilities and technologies. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a roadmap of continued spiral development over the five year program. In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complementary activities including, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, data collection and management, and a distributed collaborative engineering environment. 

The developed capabilities may be transitioned to the RC135 fleet to include Rivet Joint and Senior Scout, C2C, National Systems, the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) and other ISR platforms. 

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $1.5M; FY 07 - $7.5M; FY 08 - $5.5M; FY09 - $5.9M; FY10 - $4.5M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $350K to $2.2M per year.

<DESC>**This mod is issued to correct the response date from March 2, 2008 to March 24, 2008.  All responses are due 12pm Eastern Time on March 24, 2008.**The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Support Contracts Department (AIR 2.3.2.1), Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127 is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies available to protect all H 53E helicopter engines and other flight-critical systems from small arms projectiles with the intention of procuring the material and services on a competitive basis.  

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  

It is a market research gathering tool used to determine potential business firms capable of providing these services prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal.  This should not be construed as a promise to contract. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  

CURRENT SYSTEM DESIGN 

The H-53E-series helicopter is powered by three T64-series turboshaft engines.  The installed engines are covered by fiberglass cowlings hinged along the upper side.  The cowlings provide an aerodynamic fairing but no ballistic threat protection.  Damage to other flight-critical systems, such as main rotor and tail rotor flight controls and fuel and hydraulic lines, can force the aircraft out of its mission.  The helicopter is subject to hostile small arms fire and other threats when operating in combat areas.  A degree of personnel protection is provided by existing armored pilot seats and a ballistic protection system that covers the cockpit and passenger compartment floor areas, as well as the aircraft ramp.  The Navy is interested in solutions that would mitigate the threat of downing an aircraft due to damage to these vital aircraft systems from small arms and similar threats.  
 
DESIRED CAPABILITIES  
The Government desires a protective armor kit that could reduce the ballistic threat to critical systems on the H-53E helicopters.  The Government envisions a mission kit of armor panels or other protective means that could be installed as needed on any aircraft having mounting provisions.  The system would be easily removable at the organizational level for weight reduction when the aircraft is operating in a low-threat/no-threat environment.  There is relevant engineering design experience with a steel plate armor system for the CH-53D helicopter; however, the government has not yet defined a specific set of components to be protected on the H-53E.  The intent of this RFI is to assess the state-of-the art of the technology available in lightweight armor products that could be applied to meet this requirement.
The government is interested in unclassified written submittals of concepts and rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates for protective systems with the capabilities described above.  Respondents must clarify if their firm can provide a total systems approach for commercial or non-developmental items that could be modified to meet the Navy?s needs.  Respondents should also describe their relevant experience with similar systems and the process they would envision for the development and qualification of a product to meet the stated need.  Please submit all questions to Ronald N. Guy, Jr., Code AIR-2.3.2.1, at email ronald.guy@navy.mil or alternatively at (301) 757-5223.     

TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS
The Government envisions a solution for the H-53E Critical Systems Armor (CSA) kits that meets the following operational and program requirements:
1.  Non-Developmental Item.  The H-53E CSA material that provides ballistic protection should be a non-developmental item to the maximum extent possible.
2.  Qualification.  The H-53E CSA material that provides ballistic protection must be qualified and demonstrate compliance to the helicopter?s environment.  This includes, but is not limited to compliance with MIL-STD-810F, Change 3 and/or DO-160E environmental conditions for helicopters.  Proof of qualification / compliance in robust dust / sand, fog / rain, snow / ice, exposure to contaminants, and salt environments should be addressed in the response.
3.  Mission Removable.  The H-53E CSA will consist of an A-Kit and B-Kit.  The goal is to have commonality between CH-53E and MH-53E systems. The A kit, also referred to as installation kit, shall consist of permanent or semi-permanent installations / modifications to the aircraft.  It is desirable to have the H-53E CSA installed with little or no permanent aircraft modifications.  It is recognized that a specific A-Kit may be required for each helicopter type/model/series.   The B-Kit, also referred to as the mission removable kit, shall consist of components / assemblies which may be installed or removed as mission requirements dictate.  It is desirable that the CSA Kit would be easily removable for weight reduction when the aircraft is operating in a low threat / no threat environment.  The time to install / remove the B-Kit items will not impact mission availability for the aircraft.  The H-53E CSA must be practical to be retrofitted at a USMC organizational level facility, or by a field modification team / installed at the organizational level.
4.  Maintenance, Inspection and Repair.  The Government desires a system with minimal maintenance and inspection requirements at the organizational level.  The system should also be easily repairable for deployed units.      
5.  H-53E Performance Impact.  It is desired that installation of the H-53E CSA kit will result in limited degradation to existing range, performance / handling, and/or existing mission capabilities of either H-53E platforms. 
6.  Ballistic Protection Characteristics.  The H-53E CSA kit will provide adequate ballistic protection for its threat environment.  Interested parties should provide a summary of the proposed survivability capabilities within the H-53E CSA Kit proposal.  Threat magnitude capability (MIL-PRF-46103 standard or industry equivalent), repeatability and number of hits per a given area should be included as a minimum.  The contractor should address proven demonstration of this capability (through test and qualification data, etc) in their response. 
7.  Ballistic Protection / Coverage Areas and Weight.  The Government has not yet defined a specific set of components and/or areas to be protected on the H-53E platforms by the H-53E CSA Kit.  It is desired that the contractor define proposed coverage areas for the H-53E CSA kit in their response, and applicable weight for the CSA Kit based on their proposed coverage areas.   A desired CSA armor area density envisioned is 6.5 pounds per square feet or less. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENT PACKAGE

Documentation should be in bullet format and must address, at a minimum, any prior/current corporate experience with the military performing efforts of similar size and scope within the last three years, including contract number, unclassified technical performance capabilities, organization/platform supported, and contract value.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nev ada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of IV GRAVITY TUBING (Primary & Secondary Sets). <BR><BR>The primary objective of this pr ogram is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR>< BR>     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing  Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIA Q is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) wil l be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical /Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ t rade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be b ased on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of IV GRAVITY TUBING (Primary & Secondary Sets), which at a mini mum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $227,557.40.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage  lines for this project include:  (1) Primary IV Administration Sets-$200K and (2) Secondary IV Administration Sets- $49K.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educ ational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions  to Vendors.  <BR><BR>INTERESTED RESPONDENTS MUST PROVIDE DETAILED HARD COPY RESPONSES TO THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA REQUIREMENTS STATED WITHIN THIS NOTICE BY 3PM C ST ON 29 February 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide hard copy responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for mail to be lost, vendors must confirm with the Regional POC stated below that their submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived  at the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  Each submitting vendor will confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>Responses should be sent via your preferred delivery carrier with a requested return receipt and/or tracking number to Mrs. Sarah Allen, Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230. (ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS TO INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NO LONGER ACC EPTED)  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardizatio n process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>  Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested respon dents are to respond to this FBO announcement by mailing their intent to participate with hard copies of the following information: company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, announcement number, DAPA number and complete ans wers to the technical criteria to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be revie wed under the purview of the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR>< BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; ( 3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose produc ts are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR> The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standard ization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of IV GRAVITY TUBING (Primary & Secondary Sets).  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage ite ms are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, this includes:  (a) Primary Administration Sets with Back-check valve/ with reseal Y-injection site; (b) Secondary Administration Sets; (c) Tubing with at least two injection ports. Provide certification of all brands of this product line tha t you manufacturer or distribute with the initial submittal. <BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the IV GRAVITY TUBING (Primary & Secondary Sets) product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the appl ication process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) All e-mail communication should be digitally signed.<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement  with the regional prime vendor, Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR>4.	Vendors  must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.) Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by pre vious agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide an initial quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendo rs determined to be clinically acceptable, after clinical evaluation, will have an opportunity to submit a final quote at that time.<BR><BR><BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy pricing quotes and a competitive product cross-reference in the  prescribed (by the TRBO) electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Vendor must provide educational tools and materials for IV GRAVITY TUBING (Primary & Secondary Sets) as well as no cost samples for the evaluation.   Describe your available co mpany educational tools and material resources with the initial submittal.    <BR>7.	Vendor must provide customer service (telephonic, onsite, website or email) for regional facilities.  Identify company resources and capabilities for such support with the  initial submittal. <BR>8.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal.<BR>9.	Vendors must provide any history of bac k orders and/or FDA or company recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the IV GRAVITY TUBING (Primary & Secondary Sets) including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  <BR>10.	Vendors must provide a  standard industry warranty, at a minimum, that includes a return goods policy.  Provide a copy of their policy with their initial submittals.<BR>11.	 Vendor provided documentation that product packaging identifies products as latex free.   <BR><BR>Phase I I  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary Clinical Product Team facilitated by the TRBO will request samples (at no charge to the government) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilitie s.  Vendors are required to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 3PM CST, on the (21st)  calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR>  <BR>CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria.  All  clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical evaluation period is estimated to last approximately eight weeks.  The CPT will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like one to five rating scale where as: One (Does not meet minimum needs - worst score), Two (Meet minimum needs but is not clinically recommended), Three (Meet minimum needs), Four (Exceed minimum needs), Five (Offer superior clinical advantages - best score).  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the  break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardiza tion.  <BR><BR>In the pre-source selection procedures above, the CPT will determine/approve that both product literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation.   The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting; howeve r, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT for review.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is m ore important than the price.  Based on the clinical evaluation results, the CPT will provide a vendor selection recommendation to the TPRB. <BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT will evaluate products based on the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below: <BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR><BR>1.	The drip chamber is clear and allows staff to easily set/monitor infusion rate.<BR>2.	 The tubing has a wide range of drip rates to support a variety of patients care needs         <BR>       (Minimum 15 drops/minutes for TKO dosing to maximum 250 drops/minute for bolus dosing).<BR>3.	The tubing is easy to set up and prime to accommodate emergency needs/clinical situat ions (tubing does not retain packaging shape memory; tubing does not kink).<BR>4.	Tubing control clamp moves with ease: stops flow of fluids without crimping tubing.<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process. <BR>1.	 The following elements will be consid ered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Impact on SKUs by each vendors product submittal. Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.    <BR>2.	Vendors that meet the 3.0 clinical acceptability target threshold will be qualified to submit best value pricing for  analysis to the TRBO.  Those vendors with results less than 3.0 will be disqualified from further consideration depending on the  break  in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by th e CPT.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.  <BR>3.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing quotes, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Central Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor s best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor s best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor s best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor s DAPA pricing (b ased on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and re quest revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>4.	Those ven dors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from further consideration.<BR>5.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with poss ible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<BR>6.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the submittals become more equal, price will become m ore important.<BR>7.The Central Region TPRB reviews the data for a best value decision.  <BR>8.The DSL will ensure that the prices, with discounts off the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) will be a good value, in conjunction with the volume purcha sing commitment, and the technical merit of the submission.<BR>9.The Central Region TPRB votes for the best value for a single or multiple vendor selection(s). The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the tota l requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<BR>

Hathaway), 9324 Virginia Avenue,  Norfolk, VA 23511-3689.  Responses must be received no later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on 28 January 2008.  Electronic submission will not be accepted.  Questions regarding this sources sought notice may be addressed to Michele Hathaway at the above address, via email at Michele.Hathaway@navy.mil, or via phone at 757-322-4453. 2.0	Proposed ADS Upgrade The proposed upgrade at the Lamberts Point Deperming Station includes three primary phases: existing sensor array removal, new sensor array installation, and the installation of a series of underwater solenoids, or coils. 2.1	Sensor Array Removal As part of the proposed action, both the deep and medium depth sensor arrays were to be removed, initially.  Upon review of the recent bathymetric survey conducted around the facility, it became apparent that all the sensor tube tops were overlaid by layers of sediment ranging in thickness between 7 feet and 18 feet.  This would require divers to water-jet holes as much as 18 feet deep to gain access to any particular magnetometer tube for removing the sensor.  The NFESC ECDET submitted a recommendation to NSWCCD, NAVSEA, and MSF Norfolk to abandon in-place all medium depth sensors and cables, and remove only the deep array sensors and cables.  This recommendation had three justifications; 1) the medium depth sensor tubes are not scheduled for reuse in the future, 2) future maintenance dredging of Slip A is not planned to excavate deeper than -50 feet MLLW, and 3) attempts to remove the medium depth array would create unacceptable delays and increased costs to subsequent pro!  ject actions.   Once the sensor removal is complete, the divers will disconnect the sensor cables and will work with a crane barge to pull the remaining sensor cables out of the water for later disposal.  2.2	New Sensor Array Installation 2.2.1	Sensor Tubes A total of 291 new medium and deep sensors will be installed within Slip ?A?.  The new magnetometers will be housed inside FRP support tubes at depths of -64 feet MLLW and -85 feet MLLW, respectively.  Currently there are 106 existing sensor tubes that will be reused for the new array; 41 medium depth tubes, and 65 deep tubes.  To fill out the remainder of the array, 98 new sensor tubes will need to be installed.  In addition, 87 sensor tubes, both new and existing, will house both a medium-depth and a deep magnetometer.   The medium and deep FRP tubes will be 20 feet and 40 feet in length, respectively.  The new tubes will be pushed or water-jetted into the riverbed.  During water jetting, high-pressure water is forced through a jetting pipe as the tube casing is lowered, liquefying the bottom material. Jetting stops once the project depth is reached.  Divers are used to disconnect the jetting pipe from the FRP tube and to install temporary caps on each tube to prevent sediment intrusion. All sensor tubes are required to be installed within ?12 inches of their planned horizontal location, with tube top elevations installed within ?6 inches of the planned elevation, and a sensor tube verticality of ?3 degrees.  2.2.2	Sensor and Sensor Cable Installation A magnetometer, or sensor, assembly will consist of a single, triaxial magnetometer and cable, a carriage device called a magnetic orientation insert (MOI) which is installed inside the sensor tube and provides a means to stabilize and align the sensor to magnetic north, a sensor tube cap (part of the MOI) capable of rotating, and a sensor tube identification tag.    An exception to the assembly make-up will be the 87 sensor tubes that house both a medium and deep array sensor.  For these tubes, the MOI will be configured to house two magnetometers, one at -64 feet MLLW and one at -85 feet MLLW. After each sensor is installed in its appropriate tube, the corresponding cable will be routed along specific cable paths to, and up through, designated cable risers that will be attached to piles on Pier ?B?.  Each sensor location will be identified with a brass ID tag attached to a lifting eye on the sensor tube cap. Magnetometers and their associated cables will be GFE.   2.2.3	Sensor Junction Boxes >From the risers, each sensor cable will be routed to dedicated junction boxes mounted along the west edge of Pier ?B?.  Sensor junction boxes will be supported on aluminum frames to be fabricated and installed as part of this phase.  Each junction box will be designed to accommodate ten sensor cables that will transition to a single interconnection cable. Interconnection cables will be routed from their respective junction boxes, along a series of fiberglass and aluminum cables trays that will be mounted to the west side of Pier ?B? as part of this project, through cable trays that will be mounted beneath Pier ?E? as part of Special Project RM272-02, and ultimately into a first-floor room of the new deperming control building.  The current plan is to terminate all sensor and interconnection cables using civilian and active duty Navy personnel. Sensor junction boxes and interconnection cables will be GFE. 2.3	Y and Z Coils, or Loops This project requires the installation of two main cable loops, designated as the Y-Coil and Z-Coil.  Figure.  As shown, the Y-Coil will be configured into four rectangular coils, identified as Y1 through Y4.  Each coil will be approximately 2,000 feet in horizontal length aligned in the north-south direction.  The Z-Coil will be configured in a single rectangular coil approximately 5,360 feet in length.  The purpose of the cable coils is to generate magnetic fields using direct current.  These generated magnetic fields allow for an accurate measurement of a ship?s total magnetism and allow calibration of the new on-board advanced degaussing systems for worldwide operation. The installation tolerance for all loop cables is within ?12 inches of their planned horizontal locations.   2.3.1	Z-Coil, or Z-Loop The Z-Loop will consist of six turns of 500MCM cable, laid in a shallow dredged trench and backfilled with non-magnetic gravel for a measure of protection against fishing hooks and anchor drags.  After the cable trench is dredged, alignment piles will be driven at set intervals and at the corners where the Z-Coil makes turns.  .  Each Z-Loop turn will be installed in two segments, terminating in junction boxes mounted atop concrete-pile supported platforms.  As three of the four junction box platforms will be constructed outside the ?magnetic free zone? around the facility, standard construction materials will be employed in the fabrication and installation of these platforms.  The exception is the junction box and corresponding platform at the north end of Pier A.  Since this is within the ?magnetic free zone?, non-magnetic materials for the junction box enclosure and platform are required. Approximately 200 feet of Z-Loop cable path, around the northeast corner of the loop, will protrude into the Norfolk Harbor Federal Navigation Channel.  The channel?s current operating depth is -45 feet MLLW.  Maintenance dredging allows for an over-dredge depth of -48 feet MLLW.  In order to protect the Z-Loop cable and eliminate obstructions to future maintenance dredging of the channel, the Army Corp of Engineers, Norfolk District, has recommended the trench in this area to be dredged to a depth of -55 feet MLLW. Power to the Z-Loop will be provided by a single twisted-pair of 500MCM cables routed from the west side of the new deperming control building to one of the junction box platforms, utilizing the shallow dredged trench. 2.3.2	Y-Coil, or Y-Loop As written is paragraph 2.3, above, the Y-Coil will be configured into four rectangular coils, identified as Y1 through Y4.  To achieve this, the coils will be installed as discreet north/south segments, 2,000 feet in length, and labeled as Y1/Y3, Y1, Y3, Y2, Y4, and Y2/Y4.   The Y1/Y3 and Y2/Y4 segments will consist of nine turns of 500MCM cable, each, and either installed on the river bottom at grade inside protective HDPE conduit or in a shallow dredged trench backfilled with non-magnetic gravel.  Both ends of the cable segments will terminate inside a north and a south junction box after routing along the cable path. The Y1 and Y4 segments will consist of seven turns of 500MCM cable, each, and installed and terminated in similar fashion as the Y1/Y3 cable segments. The Y3 and Y2 segments will consist of three turns of 500MCM cable, each.  Unlike the previous four segments, these require installation at a depth of -110 feet MLLW.  To achieve this depth, these two cable segments will be installed using horizontal directional drilling technology.  This depth is required in order to satisfy system operational requirements and to ensure that the cables are installed in stable material suitable for drilling operations.  Each of the two segments will be encased in a protective conduit that will be installed as part of the drilling process.  Both ends of the cable segments will terminate inside a north and a south junction box after routing along the cable path.  The drilling equipment would rest on an anchored spud barge above the location where the cable coil is to enter the riverbed.  A guide pipe would be used to set the location where the cable loop would enter the riverbed.  The guide pipe will be fixed to the river bottom using a structural beam, referred to as an H-pile, so that it remains in constant position.  The drilling would proceed down the guide pipe to an elevation of -110 feet MLLW.  Upon achieving the selected depth, the drill would turn in a 60-inch radius and travel horizontally at the required depth to the exit point.   From here, the drill would travel through a second 60-inch radius turn toward the surface and proceed through the water column to a second barge carrying the conduit.  Once the drill has reached the second barge, the installation of the conduit would begin by pulling it back through the enlarged hole created by a back-reaming tool.  The drilling equipment would be used to pull the conduit through!   the hole, and the cable would then be pulled through the conduit.  The east-west segments of the Y-Coils would be routed along the bottom in a shallow dredged trench, to a designated junction box platform for termination. Power to the Y-Loop segments will be provided by a single twisted-pair of 500MCM cables routed from the west side of the new deperming control building to one of the junction box platforms, utilizing the shallow dredged trench. The installation tolerance for the directionally drilled loop cables is within ?3 feet of their planned locations, in the X, Y, and Z planes.   2.4	ADS Software and Hardware All software and associated hardware to be used to control and monitor the magnetic treatment process will be provided and installed by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD).

<DESC>Sources Sought /Request For Information This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  The intent of this synopsis is to identify potential qualified firms capable of providing temporary worker housing described herein.  Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will assist the Government in making the appropriate acquisition decision for the planned procurement.  This is not an announcement of availability of a solicitation. The scope of work for Worker Housing would be to provide berthing, messing, security, access to medical/dental care, transportation (which may include parking facilities) and MWR-type facilities for an off-island workforce dedicated to building Marine and DoD facilities for the Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) at various locations on the island of Guam.  The number of workers would vary according to the building schedule, from about 1,000 ? 2,000 up to a peak of about 15,000.  It is the desire of the DoD that the Worker Housing would be scalable to accommodate the varying number of workers.   The intent of this RFI is to identify potential sources and to obtain information in regard to soliciting proposals for the Worker Housing.  Some of the DoD sites being considered are South Andersen, South Finegayan, and Navy Barrigada.   The DoD is currently interested in identifying risks and advantages associated with various options for the procurement of housing services and/or facilities.  Some of the acquisition strategies being considered include: 1) contractor build, operate, maintain, and remove the temporary housing;   2) government lease of modular facilities, contractor operate and maintain housing;  3)  DPRI construction contractors supply housing for their workforce;  4) contractor build, operate and maintain, and remove housing for all workers, via contract agreements with DPRI and other contractors paying for use of the worker housing;  5)  Enhanced Use Lease (in whole or in part) where government provides a ground lease and a contractor (or contractors) build housing and lease to contractors and receive a  return on investment for building, operating and maintaining and removing the Worker Housing, or constructing other facilities through use of government land over a long term lease; 6) Gov!  ernment of Guam sponsor worker housing development on non-DoD lands to be turned over for section 8, low income housing, or other uses, later.  Certain combinations of these various acquisition strategies might also be considered. DoD?s preferred option is to have alternative financing rather than direct government funds involved in the development of and operation of the worker housing.  Specific information requested is as follows:  strategies for 1) building, operating, and removing (or reusing) the worker housing;  2) assuring that if construction contractors provide housing for their workers, those workers will be provided consistent, minimum living standards which are in compliance with DoD and local standards.   Responses should include considerations of site and location, limitations of site and location, and any other pertinent information the responder deems should be brought to the attention of the DoD.   Interested firms are encouraged to respond to the Government's market survey questionnaire by downloading the associated market survey questionnaire form by clicking on the link associated with this Sources Sought Notice.  Marketing brochures or elaborate descriptions of the company are neither necessary nor desired. This market survey is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for the requested information.   The Government will not provide a debriefing on the results of this survey nor will respondents be contacted regarding information gathered.  No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of this sources sought notice or Government use of any information provided.   As noted above, the Government intends to prepare and publicly present a summary of the results from this RFI.  Accordingly, interested parties are encouraged to mark their submissions to identify any proprietary information so as to avoid the release of that particular specific information.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL (RFP), AND A CONTRACT AWARD WILL NOT BE MADE FROM THE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF INTEREST.  The Statement of Interest is due thirty (30) days after this posting date. The maximum length of the Statement of Interest is seven (7) pages. POC: Jacob M. Punzalan, Contract Specialist (671) 339-5185 OR EMAIL: jacob.punzalan@navfacmar.navy.mil.

<DESC>PEACE - Market Research

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is conducting study entitled: PEACE (Project on Ebstein?s Anomaly Study in Children).  Specifically, a contractor will be selected to recruit approximately 900 families over a three year period from communities in Ukraine.  Children with Ebstein?s anomaly/tricuspid valve disease (referred to as case) will be recruited to the study, and also parents of the children will be recruited to the study. Controls will be recruited from the same neighborhoods as the cases (children with Ebstein?s anomaly) and will also include the parents. Controls will be matched by age, sex and region of origin to cases in a ratio of two controls for each case. If neither parent is available, at least one other blood relative will be recruited in place of the parents. The more general diagnosis of tricuspid valve disease is to be included in the selection of participants, since often those with mild forms of Ebstein?s are not appropriately diagnosed. The subjects will be interviewed by a physician, and medically evaluated by Doppler echocardiography.  Blood, cheek and saliva tissue samples will be collected to obtain DNA for a genome wide association analysis. Usually each family will only need to be seen once.  A goal of PEACE, although not a requirement to be performed or funded as part of this acquisition, is the identification of the genetic basis for Ebstein?s anomaly, a birth defect involving malformation of the tricuspid valve of the heart.  Such findings may yield insight into disease mechanisms that may provide novel diagnostic tools as well as therapeutic strategies for medical remediation of this often life threatening and debilitating congenital heart disease. (The analyses associated with the collection of samples will take place at the NHLBI.)   

The technical requirements associated with this acquisition include the following:   

1.	Recruit approximately 300 subjects with Ebstein?s anomaly and their parents and approximately 600 control subjects and their parents for PEACE.

2.	Assist in explaining the nature of the PEACE study to subjects and/or parents of subjects and obtain signed consent/assent for participation in study.

3.	Obtain from each family, information on family history with administration of questionnaire to assess possible environmental risk factors.

4.	Assist NIH team in evaluating and validating subjects and parents of subjects with Ebstein?s anomaly by Doppler echocardiography and obtaining electrocardiogram. In parallel, age matched neighborhood control subjects and their parents will be evaluated by Doppler echocardiography and using electrocardiogram to validate they do not have Ebstein?s anomaly.

5.	Provide nursing staff or physician who will obtain blood, buccal swab, and saliva tissue samples suitable for the extraction of genetic material (genomic DNA) for tests to analyze possible genetic causes for Ebstein?s anomaly. Note: analysis of genetic DNA is not a technical requirement of this contract.  

6.	Store samples and securely package and ship all tissue and blood samples to NIH. 

7.	Copy onto CD/DVD all ultrasound and EKG data, and securely package and ship CD/DVD to NIH.

8.	Coordinate and make all travel arrangements for subjects and their parents to come to the contractor site in conjunction with the schedule visits of the NIH site visit team.

9.	Assist in making local housing arrangements, transportation, and English translator for NIH site visit team.

10.	Provide appropriate private space for subject interview and evaluation, including sufficient room for housing ultrasound and electrocardiogram machines, and for conducting ultrasound and electrocardiogram evaluations.

11.	Assist NIH team in the preparation of data obtained from PEACE for scientific publication(s) in appropriate biomedical journal to report and share findings with the biomedical research community.

12.	Provide project administrator to coordinate PEACE activities at contractor site in Ukraine with work at NIH in Bethesda, MD.


All responsible sources are welcome to submit a written capability statement demonstrating their ability to perform the aforementioned technical requirements by February 22, 2008. The estimated award date is July 31, 2008.  The NAICS code is 541712. This is not a request for proposals. Questions may be directed to the Contracting Officer, Kristiane Cooper, cooperke@nhlbi.nih.gov, 301-435-4435 or the Contract Specialist, Nora Rivera, riveran@nhlbi.nih.gov, 301-434-0345.

The capabilities statement shall include 1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientific, medical expert, and technical personnel in accordance with the above requirements, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, 4) any other information considered relevant to this program, and 5) if your institution is a small business, please provide certification of the type of small business as designated by the Small Business Administration.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology (S&T) directorate is interested in identifying research and development sources that may have developed or are in the process of developing effective methods, devices and technologies that can prevent and mitigate terrorist and criminal execution of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED).  Specifically, S&T is seeking sources that can efficiently prototype solutions concepts to demonstrate significant potential for providing solutions to address the following general scenario.

Once a suicide bomber has been accurately identified by a law enforcement official, a technology, device and/or method is activated to:

1.	Immobilize the suicide bomber, preventing physical movement and specifically device activation.

And

2.	Control the space occupied by the suicide bomber and/or the explosives device in a manner that leads to significant mitigation of any resulting blast effects.

Relevant technologies, devices and methods should be ultimately demonstrable in an applications concept that can be readily deployed by law enforcement personnel with accuracy and in the presence of innocent individuals.

Through this notice, S&T desires to develop an understanding of technologies, systems components and interactions, and scenario based performance of relevant technologies. Sources with relevant approaches and complete concept ideas are encouraged to engage DHS S&T through the Long Range BAA 08-01.  

For more information about the Long Range BAA 08-01, go to www.fbo.gov and search under "BAA08-01" or www.hsarpabaa.com and select BAA 08-01 to download the announcement.  Prior to preparing white papers and full proposals, interested sources are strongly encouraged to contact the S&T Innovation Division at S&T-Innovation@dhs.gov for technical related questions and to submit a brief summary of your innovative idea.  White papers and/or full proposals may be submitted under BAA 08-01 no later than December 31, 2008, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.  Evaluations and awards will occur on a rolling selection basis.

Title:  Digitization of NTIS Technical Reports 

Description:

The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), a bureau within the Department of Commerce (DOC), is planning to enter into multiple joint venture partnerships to digitize some or all of its collection of U.S. Federal Government Technical Reports.  NTIS is requesting information from qualified sources (including U.S. commercial, educational, foundation, not-for-profit, or government), that are interested in partnering by providing digitization services in support of NTIS? large scale legacy digitization initiative. This initiative encompasses digitizing some or all of NTIS? sizeable collection of approximately two million reports (representing an estimated 200 million pages) which exist in physical form (paper and microform).  The work scope will include a formal collaboration which will provide mutual beneficial results to both parties.  NTIS does not plan to contract for digitization services, but rather, to work with multiple partners in a way that results in both NTIS and the partners sharing in the benefits of the partnerships.

NTIS is a DOC bureau, whose mission is to promote progress by serving as the Federal Government?s central means of making technical information perpetually and widely available.  The NTIS collection was assembled over the past sixty years by collecting Federal Government reports from agencies representing 97% of the Federal Government R&D budget.

While NTIS envisions a relationship where a private or public sector participant provides the actual digitization services of legacy documents, NTIS also has a long-established in-house digitization effort to respond to the public?s requests and anticipates continuing this activity in-house.

NTIS intends to require qualified interested parties to demonstrate that they have or would be able to obtain all required personnel, technology and equipment to perform large-scale digitization that would result in output which is in accordance with industry standards and include, but not be limited to:

For each digitized item, an electronic copy of the physical document which is a fully faithful, unaltered TIFF file created as a result of the scanning process.  

For each digitized item, create a machine-readable file via an Optical Character Reader (OCR) that will accompany the digitized item.

Provide to NTIS an electronic copy of each digitized item together with the OCR file.

Accommodate special handling required of some fragile documents, as may be needed.

Integrate an electronic means of attribution to NTIS within the digitized copy of each document.

Provide periodic status reports outlining progress

As part of this arrangement, NTIS would provide tangible documents for scanning and prioritize material to be sent to the private or public sector participant for digitization. The private or public sector participant will be required to send the tangible documents back to NTIS after the digitization is complete.

Place of Performance
Address: The private or public sector participant will perform the digitization/scanning process at their own cost and at either the NTIS facility in Springfield, VA or another, mutually agreed to location.

Requested Information:

Keeping NTIS goals in mind please outline how your company would partner with NTIS to digitize this legacy collection and share in the benefits of such activities.  Each respondent must submit a packet of material which includes:

1.       A single page that expresses interest in this project, listing company points of contact (name, title, email and phone) 
2.       A separate White Paper and capability statement (no more than 25 pages total) that describes:
a.       Current digitization capabilities offered 
b.       A statement of process that will be followed to perform digitization
d.       The nature of the relationship envisioned with NTIS, including the nature of the beneficial joint partnership.

Questions regarding capability statements, white papers and other documentation must be submitted in writing to the address listed below or dcampion@ntis.gov. Questions must be submitted by Wednesday, February 27, 2008.

Capability statements must be submitted as MS Word Files by COB  on Wednesday, March 5, 2008, to dcampion@ntis.gov

NTIS may ask interested parties to clarify information provided or submit additional information. 

IMPORTANT NOTICE:    This announcement is a request for information only and does not obligate NTIS in any way.   This is not a request for proposal and NTIS will not pay for any information submitted or for any expenses associated with providing information. Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.

Material submitted will be deemed proprietary to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations if so marked by the respondent.

<CONTACT>Cheryl Daniels, (256) 842-2227
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Cent er (AMRDEC), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama is seeking sources of information on current or near near-term automatic flight-worthy linking/load-bearing mechanisms to be used with during vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) external slingload operations for mann ed and/or unmanned missions. The AMRDEC is currently conducting a series of experiments and associated studies examining the enabling technologies and concepts necessary to employ a VTOL UAS in an unmanned aerial resupply (UAR) role.  In this role the UAS would autonomously pick-up and deliver payloads.  While this concept presents numerous technological challenges, the focus of this RFI is to address the mechanical linking mechanism between the UAS and the payload.  Because of the desired autonomous end-st ate of this concept, the male and female components of the mechanism must be able to safely and securely link the UAS to the external load (i.e. without a man-in-the-loop requirement to manipulate the components) and be airworthy for the range of mil itary slingload operations.  The proposed mechanism should be compatible with or adaptable to some or all of a broad range of current and/or anticipated military payloads, to include 463L pallets, cargo nets, standard containers, and military vehicles.  Id eally, this linking mechanism will have a scalable design, allowing it to be produced in different sizes and weight capabilities to accommodate the different range of external payload capabilities limitation (i.e. 5 lbs to - 60,000 lbs.) of current or proj ected platforms.  While meting the full weight range is advantageous, since this RFI seeks to address the full spectrum of UAV sizes, the AMRDEC is also interested in offerors who are only able to address a portion of this span.  Submissions should include  any airworthiness certifications they have obtained.  In the absence of such certification, detailed path to obtaining certification, to include a timeline, is desired, but not required.<BR><BR>Since this concept has the potential to remove the requiremen t for an individual on the ground during manned sling-load operations, the AMRDEC will also evaluate the submitted linking mechanisms for their application applicability to sling-load operations for the current and future DoD inventory of manned rotary-win g aircraft (e.g. UH-72A Lakota, CH-47 Chinook,  & UH/CH/SH-60 Blackhawk/Seahawk, CH-53 Sea Stallion, and Joint Heavy Lift).<BR><BR>Interested Contractors/Vendors are asked to submit white papers, not to exceed to 10 pages, containing a description of the s ystems, technologies and concepts, currently available or in development, which have potential application to this project. The white paper may be supplemented with video, graphical presentations and drawings.  Responses should also include a brief summary  of experience in this technical field, maturity of the system (R&D, Production, Fielded etc.) cost and production capability, and production schedule.  In addition contractors/vendors may be asked to conduct a proof of concept demonstration of their syste ms at their own expense.  Those participating will assume all other expenses.  Responding vendors should provide information regarding this announcement to (name, office, address, telephone, fax, and e-mail) before April 9, 2008.  Responses may be submitte d in hardcopy and/or electronic media (CD-ROM/DVD) in standard Microsoft Office files and compatible audio-visual file formats (e.g., pdf, jpg, gif, mpeg, mpg, mp2, avi, wav, and wmv).  Technical questions may be addressed to Mr. Robert Johnson, US Army Av iation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center, Advanced Science & Technology Directorate, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 35898-5000. Telephone: (25 6) 876-2447, fax: (256)842-8764, E-mail: robert.a.johnson2@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposal and it is not a commitment by the US Army to procure products or services. The GOVERNMENT DOES N OT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.

<ARCHDATE>04302008
<CONTACT>Debra Shreve, 703-704-2204
<DESC>Combat Vehicle Crewman (CVC) Modular Body Armor System (MBAS) <BR><BR>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - Product Manager- Soldier Survivability (PM-SSV) is seeking information regarding the availability of Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government-off-th e-Shelf (GOTS) Combat Vehicle Crewman (CVC) Modular Body Armor System (MBAS). This notice constitutes a Request for Information only, THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made for this effort at this time. <BR><BR>BACKGROUND: PM-SSV is conducting a  market survey to determine the availability of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), modified COTS or government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) that is tailorable, (i.e. the Soldier will be able to add or subtract protection levels based upon the threat).  The modular s ystem must provide required protection levels for Mounted Soldiers as defined below. After review and evaluation of industry's submissions, samples of the most promising candidates may be procured for the Soldier Protection Demonstration (field assessment)  to evaluate the capability and suitability for Army use. <BR><BR>DESCRIPTION: The Army seeks a Combat Vehicle Crewman (CVC) Modular Body Armor System (MBAS) that meets the requirements outlined below: <BR><BR>1.	The MBAS will be tailorable in that levels of Protective Coverage shall be scalable and movable (ability to be repositioned on the body) by the Soldier to accommodate form, fit, and function depending on their duty position and platform.<BR><BR>2.	The MBAS will be designed to reduce or eliminate snag hazards currently encountered with fielded system(s).<BR><BR>3.	The MBAS outer cover assembly will be flash / flame retardant to the same level as the current CVC spall vest at a minimum.<BR><BR>4.	The MBAS will be compatible with all CVC OCIE.<BR><BR >5.	The system will provide protection and to the same ballistic levels as current Interceptor Body Armor systems.<BR><BR>6.	The MBAS must provide protection to the areas of abdomen / torso, deltoid, upper shoulder and arm while not interfering with platfo rm controls during ingress / egress or while performing crew drills.<BR><BR>7.	The MBAS must fit the 5th thru 95th percentile Soldier using the minimum number of unique sizes (5 objectives).<BR><BR>8.	The MBAS will require a quick release capability.<BR><B R><BR>9.	The system must provide the capability to extract an unconscious Soldier from the platform.<BR><BR>10.	 MBAS shall be compatible with the current hard armor ballistic inserts, ESAPI and/or XSAPI.<BR><BR>The concept of operations is for the MBAS to  be a flexible armor system worn over the crewmans clothing ensemble. The CVC MBAS will be tailorable, (i.e. the Soldier will be able to add or subtract protection levels based upon the threat).  The modular system must provide protection levels for Mount ed Soldiers that mirror the Interceptor Body Armor (IBA) System (T).  The crewman must be able to tailor the body armor system to a 9mm / spall protection level while performing his combat tasks inside his host platform (T).  The system will provide Mounte d Soldiers with frontal and rear (abdomen and torso), deltoid, upper shoulder, and upper arm protection while not interfering with platform / vehicle controls or ingress / egress (T).  The MBAS must be compatible with all CVC OCIE items (T).  The layers sh all be designed in such a way as to mitigate thermal burden and enhance venting of body heat (T).  The armor outershell will have flash / flame protection equivalent to current CVC uniform (T).  When the CVC dismounts the body armor shall be tailorable in conjunction with the layers already worn to reduce probability of perforation at the same level and protection areas as that provided by the IBA Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV).  The CVC will have the capability to add additional armor while mounted to  meet threats depending on mission  (T), (i.e. a gunner of an Abrams Main Battle Tank may have to assume duties of a loader and find himself exposed to enemy di rect fire while engaging targets with the M240B).  The crewman must exit through a hatch measuring 15 3/4 x 21 3/4 without any degradation of ingress / egress performance when compared to current USAARMC / AR 670-1 uniform standards (T).  The MBAS will n ot hinder access to current extraction systems currently provided within the CVC coverall (T).<BR><BR>At this time, PM-SSV is seeking sources, technical and product information for MBAS. This market survey is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this RFI by submitting product literature, technical specifications, pertinent test data, cost, material safety data sheets (if applicable), and product ava ilability. Responses are due NLT 01 March 2007.  Please only submit information on products that are currently commercially available or products that are in the final stages of development and will be available for purchase and delivery.  Products must co mply with the Buy American Act and the Berry Amendment.  Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the US Government. The Government will not pay for information received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information rec eived. Inclusion in this RFI or the resulting database does not constitute Department of the Army approval for any product. An INDUSTRY DAY will be hosted by PM-SSV on/or about 01 April 2007, providing the opportunity for those responding to this RFI by th e suspense date to demonstrate their product for further evaluation.    Responses may be sent via e-mail to Mr. Alan Ferneau, alan.ferneau@us.army.mil or by regular mail to Product Manger  Soldier Survivability, ATTN: Mr. Alan Ferneau, 10170 Beach Road, B ldg 328T, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5820. <BR>

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Tray, Mess, Compartmented (White) to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Compartmented Mess Trays by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Tray, Mess, Compartmented (White)
7350-01-012-8787


The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 7, Fort Worth, TX.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Compartmented Mess Trays to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Compartmented Mess Trays to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 6, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Wallboards and Bars to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Wallboards and Bars by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Wallboard and Bars
7110-00-NIB-0028

<SUBJECT>16 -- Broad Agency Announcement for Close Air Support of Ground Troops in Contact
<DESC>Program Objectives and Description:
The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) announces interest in research and development of persistent airborne Close Air Support (CAS) of ground Troops in Contact (TIC).  The area of interest includes new ideas and innovative approaches to rapidly mature proven technologies to a production readiness state, as well as applications of existing COTS-NDI solutions that may be integrated onto an existing airframe.  Operational considerations include austere fields, small support crew, minimal aircrew, low weight and drag.  Primary interest is in the following areas, listed in descending order of priority:
Fire Control Systems (Integrated-Stand Alone)
Battle-Mission Management
Integrated Air-Ground Picture (IAGP):
Cooperative Engagement Capability    
- Sensor Correlation-Evaluation
- Simulation and Modeling
- Command, Control, and Communications
- Network Centric Operations
- System Interoperability
- Other Applicable IAP Technologies
- Data, Sensor, Display Fusion  
Day-Night and Active-Passive Sensors
Target Identification-Recognition 
Weapons-Warhead Accuracy-Lethality
Precision Guided Munitions, Launchers
Guns, Mounts
Human or Machine Interface 
Communications (Local, Global)
Other applicable technologies

Teaming is encouraged.  An offeror may submit more than one concept aligned with the technologies listed above.  Responses are requested from any responsible US organizations including those from private industry, academic institutions, research institutions and non-profit organizations.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government?s needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by USSOCOM.  

Responses:  Interested parties are invited to submit a white paper for preliminary consideration.  White papers may be submitted at any time after issuance of this BAA up to the expiration date of the BAA.  Successful responses should segment their studies into an initial 8 month or shorter Phase 1 to explore and validate the technical feasibility of the concept, and one or more additional phases as optional efforts culminating in technology demonstration.  The total effort including options should not exceed 24 months.  Successful initial phases will have a greater likelihood of receiving funding for subsequent optional phases.

Format: The form and format for white papers follows below.  White papers that do not satisfy these form and format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation.  All submissions should be in the English language.  White papers should be submitted electronically; a paper copy is not required. Electronic copies should be in PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word.  

White Paper Preparation: A white paper should be a brief summary.  It introduces the idea, solicits interaction with government, and avoids the expense of generating proposals that have little likelihood of selection or award within this BAA.  White papers should summarize the planned proposal and clearly articulate the innovative concept or technology development and demonstration being proposed.  White papers should contain a cover sheet (clearly marked White Paper), a ten page (maximum) summary of the technical idea, a one-page cost summary, and a one-paragraph (150-200 words) abstract of the white paper as a whole.  All pages should be printable on 8.5 by 11 inch paper; type not smaller than 12 point.  The page limitations for white papers include all figures, tables, and charts.  No formal transmittal letter is required.  White papers shall not include proprietary or classified information. 

Submittal address: All white papers should be sent electronically to:  Maj Brady Hauboldt, USSOCOM, SOAL-FW, (813) 826-9390, brady.hauboldt@socom.mil.  White papers received by USSOCOM but not submitted specifically to the BAA may not be considered under the BAA.

Evaluation and Notification: Acknowledgment of receipt of all white papers will be made. White papers will not be returned.  White papers will be evaluated based on the relevance to the SOF mission.  The initial screening will minimize unnecessary effort and expense in any subsequent proposal preparation and review.  Favorable response to a white paper is not an assurance that a full proposal on the white paper's topic will ultimately be selected for contract award.  

Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the technology objectives rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.  The following factors are to be considered in the evaluation of white papers received under this BAA.  Listed in descending order of importance: 1) potential contribution to CAS-TIC mission; 2) likelihood of transition to the military if technically successful; 3) offeror's capabilities and related experience, including qualifications and achievements of all team members and their key personnel, their capability to carry out further development and production, and the adequacy of facilities and equipment to be used for the proposed effort; 4) overall scientific and technical merit including degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational issues, and demonstration approach; 5) project plan; and 6) cost and cost realism.  All proposals must first be deemed acceptable under criteria (1) to receive a full technical review.  

The BAA will remain open for submissions for 12 months from the date of posting.  Submissions received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated.  USSOCOM will review and respond to each white paper on a quarterly basis; however reserves to right to review and respond as submissions are submitted.  Upon completion of the evaluation, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has merit and will be considered for award as funds become available, or 2) the proposal does not contain sufficient relevance to the SOF mission to be of interest to the command.  

Awards: Funds are currently available for multiple awards.  An invitation to submit a full proposal will be made to offerors on the basis of the white paper evaluation criteria above and program balance to provide best value to the Government.  Awards will be subject to the availability of funds.  Award instruments may take the form of a procurement contract, grant, or agreement depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  All work beyond Phase I shall be submitted as options.  An estimated cost for options beyond Phase I must be included or the options will not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to 1) select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received, and 2) incrementally fund any award instrument.  All awards made as a result of this BAA will require the awardee to deliver a final technical report (as a minimum) at the end of the contract and or options.  The government will have unlimited data rights to all information and  products generated under contracts that result from this BAA.

Classified Submissions: White paper and proposal submissions in response to this BAA should be kept UNCLASSIFIED.  If classified information is expected to result from any contract, the offeror shall notify USSOCOM in the white paper or proposal.
  
Organizational Conflict of Interest:  Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any government technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission, and the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. If the offeror believes that no such conflict exists, then the offeror shall so state in the affirmation.

Administration: USSOCOM will reply to questions relating to this BAA and will make replies to questions of general interest available to prospective offerors.  All correspondence including questions and requests for access to the replies to the questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to one of the addresses below.  USSOCOM prefers to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding this BAA.  The address for this BAA are: EMail:  brady.hauboldt@socom.mil.

The incumbent may experience regular and moderate levels of job-related stress from demanding activities and occasional tight timeframes, or from frequent queries from project and CDC staff to explain, clarify and otherwise assist in the understanding of Counseling and Testing activities or process results.  The need to meet tight deadlines and produce data and reports for use by senior CDC and host country officials also may induce psychologically demanding stress.
Frequent travel, such as day trips several times a month, throughout Mozambique working away from duty station represents a moderate degree of disruption to work patterns.

CONTRACTOR-MISSION RELATIONSHIPS 
 
   (a) The contractor acknowledges that this contract is an important part of the U.S. Foreign Assistance 
Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities that this entails.  
   (b) While in the Cooperating Country, the contractor is expected to show respect for the conventions, customs, and institutions of the Cooperating Country and not interfere in its political affairs.
 
   (c) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with paragraph (b) of this provision, the contract may be unilaterally terminated by the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor recognizes the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct his/her immediate removal from any country when, in the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the United States so require.
 
   (d) The Country Director is the chief representative of CDC in the Cooperating Country.  In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the total CDC Program in the Cooperating Country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for advising CDC regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program.  The contractor will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of duties called for by the contract. However, he/she shall be under the general policy guidance of the Country Director, and shall keep the Country Director or his/her designated representative currently informed of the progress of the work under this contract.

SOCIAL SECURITY, FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND FOREIGN EARNED INCOME

The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas.  In such case, the contractor would be eligible for contributions under paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) as appropriate.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-08-R-625445 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.  This is a unrestricted procurement.  The NAICS is 332999.  

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

The Office of Organizational Development is responsible for organizational-wide education initiatives as well as identification and support of workforce development. An executive coaching program was launched in 2006 as part of a larger competency-based management development program.
