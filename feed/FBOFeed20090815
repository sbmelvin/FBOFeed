<DESC><p>In accordance with FAR Part 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) intends to procure professional services on a sole source basis from the Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) Executive Branch Policy Fellowship in Child Development Program. The SRCD Executive Branch Policy Fellowship program is designed to provide greater interaction between the developmental research community and federal research programs and policies. Following a two-week science policy orientation program at American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Fellows work as resident scholars in a federal agency that sponsors developmental research, providing advice and guidance to programs, and working in partnership with research teams within the federal government.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be from September 1, 2009 through August 31, 2010.</p>
<p><br />Background and Objectives</p>
<p>The SRCD Executive Branch Policy Fellowships program is designed to provide greater interaction between the developmental research community and federal research programs and policies. Following a two-week science policy orientation program at American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Fellows work as resident scholars in a federal agency that sponsors developmental research, providing advice and guidance to programs, and working in partnership with research teams within the federal government.</p>
<p>Statement of Work</p>
<p>The contractor will provide the OBSSR with an SRCD Executive Branch Policy Fellow (Fellow) to perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the Director and OBSSR staff in (1) the process of establishing directions for social and behavioral sciences research at the National Institutes of Health and (2) also assist in the scientific planning in a wide range of behavioral and social sciences topics while gaining an understanding of the role of science administrators in the scientific process.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the OBSSR Representative to the National Children's Study. This task involves attending the regular planning meetings and monitoring the role of behavioral and social sciences research in the design of the study. Provide staff support as assigned to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on cataloguing the available instruments to measure experience of racism to support the efforts of this study.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the OBSSR liaison person to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Attend the NICHD Advisory Council Meeting and report to the OBSSR on current and proposed initiatives relevant to behavioral and social sciences research.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as OBSSR Representative to the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort. This is a Department of Education study that has NIH support. The Fellow will coordinate the review of applications for a training session on the use of this database. The Fellow also attends regular planning meetings and reports to OBSSR.</p>
<p>&bull; The Fellow will be responsible to perform other duties as assigned to help meet the pressing needs of the office on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p><br />Sole Source Justification</p>
<p>The Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) is the only organization that can provide an SRCD Executive Branch Policy Fellow on September 1, 2007 as required by OBSSR. The SRCD has identified Dr. Dara Blachman as a candidate who is willing and qualified to perform the tasks identified above. Further, Dr. Blachman has previously served under the OBSSR and therefore has the required knowledge base.</p>
<p>Contractor Qualifications</p>
<p>The SRCD was founded in 1933 to advance research in child development, to foster an interdisciplinary consideration of substantive and methodological problems in the field of child development, and to encourage applications of research findings. The Society publishes two journals, a newsletter, a membership directory, and a social policy report; holds biennial meetings in March or April of odd-numbered years; sponsors conferences; and supports a Washington, DC-based policy and communications office. Its membership of more than 5,600 is representative of the various disciplines and professions that contribute to knowledge of child development.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the Committee on Policy and Communications, the Society helps to bring the results of research to bear on the formulation of policy affecting children and families. One way this is done is through the Society for Research in Child Development Policy Fellowships. Since 1978, SRCD has recruited and facilitated the placement of more than 60 AAAS congressional and (since 1991), executive branch fellows. The goals of these fellowships are to contribute to the effective use of scientific knowledge in developing public policy, to educate the scientific community about the development of public policy, and to establish a more effective liaison between scientists and the federal policy-making mechanisms.</p>
<p><br />This requirement is for a twelve (12) month period. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responses received by the closing date of this notice will be considered by NIH in accordance with the evaluation criteria identified below. The quoter shall include all information, which demonstrates, documents and/or supports the qualification of the Offeror to fulfill the above described requirement in one clearly marked section of its quotation.</p>

<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services from&nbsp;John Starmer, MSc, Coral Reef Mointoring, Coastal Resources Management Office, Office of the Governor, Saipan, Northern Marianas Islands&nbsp;for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service&nbsp;for: Background<br />The National Marine Fisheries Service (1'.TMFS) defines a Species of Concern (SOC) as a species<br />that is not being considered actively for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) but for<br />which significant concerns or uncertainties regarding its biological status and/or threats exist (69<br />FR 19975). The purpose of the NMFS SOC Program is to conduct proactive conservation<br />activities under the ESA to preclude the listing of future species, rather than addressing the<br />recovery needs of a species listed. Two of the Pacific Islands Region Species of Concern are the<br />humphead wrasse, Cheilinus undulatus, and the bwnphead parrotfish, Bolbometopon muricatum.<br />This project aims to contribute to the conservation and understanding of these two SOC, the<br />humphead wrasse, Cheilinus undulatus, and the bumphead parrotfish, Bolbometopon muricatum.<br />Both species are considered rare (mCN Endangered and Threatened) throughout their range and<br />it is widely recognized that both species warrant increased management and conservation efforts.<br />The project proposes to assess the status and habitat specificity of both species in Guam, develop<br />a draft outreach and education campaign, as well as develop a draft management plan for the two<br />species in the U.S. Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands (CNMI) and U.S. Territory of Guam.<br />The archipelago spans across 466 miles and includes 15 islands, all within the known range of<br />both SOc.<br />The project aims to complement the work completed during a 2008-2009 funded NMFS<br />Proactive Species Conservation Program project in the CNMI by expanding the project to<br />include the densely populated island of Guam, by conducting a directed tagging study at a site in<br />the moderately populated island of Saipan, and by drafting an adaptive archipelagic management<br />plan for both fish species in the Mariana Islands.<br />Goals and Objectives<br />Goal 1: Random, stratified underwater visual surveys, and manta tows where possible, will be<br />conducted by divers along fore-reef slopes at multiple sites around Guam and within the lagoonal<br />habitat of Cocos Lagoon. Collaboration will also occur with NMFS Pacific Islands Fisheries<br />Science Center on data collected on their biennial research cruises to Guam and CN1vfl, where<br />possible.<br />Goal 2: Interviews with fishermen, divers, and other knowledgeable individuals will provide past<br />and present abundance, catch rates, and aggregation site data.<br />1<br />Goal 3: Acoustic tagging of terminal and initial phase C. undulatus on Saipan to obtain<br />information on home range size, diel activity, and aggregations.<br />Goal 4: An education and outreach program will be drafted to educate the public about SOC<br />issues and begin to build support for voluntary compliance of future management<br />recommendations and regulations.<br />Goal 5: Data collected from this project and from a similar project in CNMI will be used to guide<br />the development of a draft integrated, adaptive SOC management plan in the Mariana Islands.<br />Expected outcomes and benefits of the proposed activities:<br />This study will address data gaps in our knowledge of both fish SOC by identifying areas of<br />importance to SOC conservation on Guam to complement the data currently being collected for<br />CNMI. It is anticipated that this data, which is scientifically robust, will eventually enhance the<br />future stakeholder acceptance of extant, proactive SOC conservation efforts and lay the<br />groundwork for stakeholder buy-in when developing fisheries regulations. Objective information<br />on SOC population status will allow evaluation ofpresent fisheries regulations and are necessary<br />to provide justification for development of appropriate changes to creating a future crossjurisdictional<br />SOC fisheries management plan. Preliminary efforts to educate and engage<br />stakeholders will build support for voluntary compliance with recommendations and future<br />regulations to enhance SOC populations.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Zebra Enterprise Solutions (Wherenet Corporation), of Santa Clara, California, for the acquisition of a Sapphire Dart Receiver with an Omni-Directional Antenna to be used by the Intelligent Systems Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

***NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii)	Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in –
(A)	Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or  
(B)  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C.2304(d)(1)(B) or U.S.C.253(d)(1)(B).
***** Sole source determination is based on the need for the expansion of the Multi-Spectral Ultra Wide Band (UWB) position measurement system. This system is used for position measurement and tracking capabilities, such as multiple moving and stationary objects, tracking of Pedestrians, and vehicle motions. NIST has developed software based on the Ultra Wide Band Technology (UWT).  This system consists of small transmitters that are placed on the objects of interest, receivers that acquire information from the transmitters, and a central computing lab.  These components are connected via a Multi-Spectral System that is proprietary communications, and is compatible with existing equipment.  Zebra Enterprises (Wherenet) is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required Sapphire Dart Receiver with an Omni-Directional Antenna
***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by 
August 19, 2009 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC><p>15 Aug 09 - The purpose of this modification is to add some questions and answers.</p>
<p>24 June 09 - Q&amp;A</p>
<p>1. Where is the geographic location that services are to be provided?</p>
<p><br />Bldg 249, 530 Hickam Ave</p>
<p><br />2. Are there any security clearance requirements for the contractor? yes</p>
<p>3. How many contractors are you seeking for this requirement? 1</p>
<p><br />4. Is this a firm fixed price contract, or T &amp;M? Firm fixed.</p>
<p>5. Are all the computer facilities located in one building? Same bldg. different bays.</p>
<p>6. Can you tell me if there is an incumbent for this effort? We do have an incumbent</p>
<p>7. What city and state is this address located in? Travis AFB</p>
<p>8. What level of security clearance will the contractor be required to have, secret, top secret? Secret</p>
<p>9. Work Hours/Days: The government will determine the number of units required each week and will notify the contractor with the intended schedule no later than 24 hours prior to the designated work unit. Units will generally be scheduled from 0800-1300, excludes federal holidays. The contractor will be required to be available between the hours of 0800 and 1300 Tuesday through Thursday to support the computer based testing lab. The operation of the computer based testing lab is critical to our mission and cannot be down for any period of time as it would result in a work stoppage. Each unit will require five hours. In cases where the time exceeds five hours, the contractor will be paid on a prorate basis for the additional time worked. Exact days and times of the services will be determined by the government representatives in advance and may be modified according to the changing program needs. If the schedule session must be canceled due to an emergency, a 24-hour notification prior to the start of the session must be provided by the contractor.</p>
<p>This is not consistent with a firm fixed price contract, as it will be impossible to determine the number of hours to be worked by the contractor in advance, and therefore establish a basis for a firm fixed price. Can you please elaborate further on the expected work hours for the contract year?</p>
<p>Answer: 156 units each unit is 5 hours (780 hours per annum). The times may slightly<br />vary pending computer lab scheduling however; the normal days will be<br />Tue-Thurs (1 unit per day).</p>
