<DESC>The Center for Grain and Animal Health Research (CGAHR), 1515 College Ave., Manhattan, KS 66502, conducts innovative research and develops new technologies to solve problems related to flour production; CGAHR is in need of a new Milling Machine. One of the CGAHR requirements for a Mill is that can process bushels of wheat, so that those bushels can be continuously milled. The experimental milling system must be capable of performing the U.S. Hard Winter Wheat Crop Survey. Capable of producing at least six (6) flour products, this provides considerably more information how the wheat sample might perform on a large-scale commercial mill, which is a critical requirement of the crop survey. Consistency in data methods is of paramount importance.

<DESC>USDA, APHIS, intends to issue an Invitation for Bids for the Decommissioning and Demolition of the Hawaii Fruit Fly Production Facility located at Waimanalo, Hawaii.<br /><br />The facility is approximately 35,000 square feet, consisting of a combination of poured concrete, reinforced masonry, steel framing, and a metal roof. The structure is essentially a bearing wall system with intermediate steel columns. Vertical loads on the second floor are carried by reinforced concrete floors which span to bearing walls. Vertical loads on the roof are carried by a metal deck spanning to steel roof beams (purlins) which are in turn supported by bearing walls or steel roof girders. The steel roof girders span between columns and bearing walls. The bearing walls are reinforced 8-inch concrete masonry units. Continuous wall footings are placed below all bearing and shear walls. As a result of the high number of walls and wall footings that form the perimeter of each room, the floor slab is placed as a series of individual slabs, one slab for each room with an expansion joint at the perimeter wall. The slab is 4-inches thick and is placed on a 4-inch, compacted base course. Control joints are placed with spacing ranging from 15' to 20' center to center. Multiple air handlers are on the roof, compressors are on a concrete pad beside the building, two boilers are inside the facility, as well as a backup generator and diesel tank on concrete pads. Metal monorails were installed throughout much of the facility. Demolition requires complete removal of the facility and termination and capping of utilities.<br /><br />The estimated magnitude of this project is between $1 million and $5 million. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238910. The Small Business Standard Size is $14 million. The solicitation, including specifications and all other documents related to this procurement, will be available at no charge on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov) on or around 18 June 2010. All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the agency. The tentative date for opening bids is 19 July 2010. The estimated date for completing contract performance is 28 February 2011.<br /><br />It is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor this site for the solicitation and amendments, if any. Questions concerning this synopsis should be directed to James Roloff, Contracting Officer, by email at james.g.roloff@aphis.usda.gov. Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.

<p>PART: U.S. Government Procurement<br />SUBPART: Products<br />CLASSCODE: 58 - Communication, Detection, and Coherent Radiation Equipment<br />OFFADD: Federal Bureau of Prisons<br />Construction Contracting Section<br />320 First Street, NW, 500-6, Washington, D.C. 20534<br />SUBJECT: 58 -Provide trunked land mobile radio (LMR) systems and radio communications repair and maintenance services to support the critical operation of FBOP two-way radio communications assets. <br />SOL: RFP X00-0 Nb B `<br />DUE: N/A<br />POC: Joseph Bottoni, Contracting Officer, (202) 307-0954<br />DESC:</p>
<p><br />This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates awarding a fixed-price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity multiple-year (base year, plus 4 option years) contract for new, trunked, land mobile radio (LMR) systems to provide communications for officer safety and institutional operations. A typical configuration shall be a single site, trunked system, operating with-in UHF 406-420 MHz. The system shall have multiple repeater channels and use a 3600 baud control channel or higher. The trunked system shall dynamically and automatically assign a small number of frequencies to gain their maximum use. Each system must be equipped with an emergency alarm notification that must be received and transmitted through the trunking control channel. It is critical that immediate emergency notification be provided to a system dispatcher even when all voice channels are busy. The equipment shall include radio frequency (RF) infrastructure equipment and subscriber radios. Services will include: project management, systems engineering, design, staging, site preparation/development, equipment installation and optimization, acceptance testing, and training. In addition to infrastructure equipment, FBOP sites may require an equipment shelter of an adequate size to house the proposed infrastructure equipment and management terminals, as well as an adequate work space. Infrastructure installation may also specify a provision for self-supporting tower (PiROD SU Series, or equivalent). In some instances, system installation may integrate an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). Site development could necessitate a generator to provide back up electrical power.</p>
<p>This requirement will include radio communications repair and maintenance services to support the critical operation of FBOP two-way radio communications assets. This requirement must provide for the diagnostics, components, and technical services required for the restoration of defective radio equipment back to factory specified operating condition. Prospective vendors must be capable of servicing existing digital, analog, conventional and trunked radio formats comprising of Motorola 3600 baud trunking infrastructure, conventional base stations, portable, mobile, and control products utilized by FBOP institutions, as well as the new equipment and systems proposed under this requirement. Maintenance service will include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p>1. Handheld and mobile radio depot level repair and preventive maintenance;<br />2. Annual system Survey and Analysis visits for infrastructure optimization;<br />3. On-site response to system outages and restoration to system malfunctions on a 24/7 service window;<br />4. Infrastructure circuit board and module repair;<br />5. Nation-wide network monitoring and remote diagnostics;<br />6. Telephone technical support; and <br />7. Centralized system management and on-site dispatch function to provide coordinated maintenance scheduling logistics support, engineering support, scheduling of all technical activities, and performance reporting on all scheduled and corrective maintenance activities provided to Institutions.</p>
<p>It is critical that each vendor, for this requirement, possess the capability to execute all equipment and service requirements. Comprehensive procurement and maintenance of all assets, by one vendor, will provide the FBOP assurance that all equipment will operate reliably under all circumstances, while eliminating the possibility of non-compatibility between individually serviced equipment. One vendor will ensure that the FBOP management of this program will not exceed current government work loads and resources.</p>
<p>Participation by small, small dis-advantaged, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and severe disabled veteran-owned businesses is encouraged. Faith-based and Community-based Organizations have the right to submit offers/bids equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. To be considered, firms must have at least five (5) years experience with projects of similar scope. Failure to identify all site personnel and provide requisite resumes may disqualify an Offeror from further consideration or result in a lower technical score. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are, with the exception of price, listed in descending order of importance: past performance (descending order of subfactors: Past Performance Quality Control and Quality Assurance, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment to Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems), technical (descending order of subfactors: Technical Capabilities, Proposed Key Organization and Key Personnel, Quality Control/Quality Assurance, and Corporate Resources and Ability to Effectively Manage the Contract, with the following sub/subfactors: Corporate or Company Resources dedicated specifically to the management of this contract; Staff Training Program to include technical, health and safety, and supervisory training; Recruiting and Retention Plan; Health and Safety Plan; and Drug Free Workplace Policy), small business subcontracting, and price. Additional or Bonus points may be awarded for Technical, Past Performance, and/or Small Business Subcontracting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 9.104-1, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated by the Government pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The Government reserves the right to award to one or more vendors who will be selected for award on the basis of their proposal being the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Each technical proposal will be evaluated qualitatively and categorized as in relation to the evaluation factors set forth in this solicitation. A finding of Unacceptable in one technical factor may result in the entire technical proposal being found to be unacceptable. Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than cost or price. Prospective Offerors are forewarned that an acceptable technical proposal and marginal past performance (if included as a factor) with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher-priced proposal affords the Government the best value. The Government may elect to pay a premium price to select an Offeror whose non-cost/price evaluation factors (e.g., technical and past performance, if included) are superior.</p>
<p>This agency will consider all proposals submitted by responsible sources. The solicitation, which includes instructions for submitting a quote, will be available on or about <br />August 29, 2005. This solicitation is unrestricted. Point of Contact of inquiries and clarifications is Joseph Bottoni, Contracting Officer, Federal Bureau of Prisons, 320 <br />First Street, NW., Rm. 500-6, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for an intensified CCD camera for use in characterizingfuel spray, combustion and emissions from aircraft combustor simulators. The device willbe used for laser induced fluorescence and Raman scattering spectroscopy measurements,among others. Measured signals will be primarily from the ultraviolet through thevisible.NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Princeton Instruments.The components of this purchase must be fully compatible and interchangeable withexisting hardware (Princeton Instruments PI-MAX and Acton SP-300 monochromator/imagingspectrometer). In addition, they must also be capable of being seamlessly controlledusing the Princeton Instruments WinView and WinSpec software, which is used to operatethe cameras and spectrometer. Princeton Instruments is the sole supplier of thisproprietary software.Both the existing and new instrumentation will be used in at least three different testcells and will be configured as needed for the particular tests to be conducted. Theseexperiments include Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence, Spontaneous Raman Scattering,flame emission spectroscopy, and Particle Image Velocimetry, among others. Thus, therequirement for both old and new components to be physically compatible is imperative, soas to move seamlessly from one test cell to another. Substitution by any other productwill reduce the efficiency of setup, data taking, and the productivity of processingthese data.

<DESC>INSTALLATION OF RAINBOW TURF(or equal)  RUBBER WALKING SURFACE(including excavation, site preparation, materials and installation) 

I. BACKGROUND
The Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, a unit of the National Park Service, is located within Duval and Nassau Counties in Northwest Florida.  Kingsley Plantation is a historical site with the Preserve. 
The Kingsley Plantation has national and international significance in the interpretation of slavery and race relations in Spanish Florida and the United States. Kingsley is the oldest existing plantation in Florida and is on the historic Register.
During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many people came to Florida. Some, like Zephaniah Kingsley, sought to make their fortunes by obtaining land and establishing plantations. Others forced to come to Florida to work on those plantations, their labor providing wealth to the people who owned them. Some of the enslaved would later become free landowners, struggling to keep their footing in a dangerous time of shifting alliances and politics. All of these people played a part in the history of Kingsley Plantation.
Kingsley Plantation symbolizes a time and a place in history. More than that, Kingsley Plantation represents people, free and enslaved, ordinary and extraordinary, and their efforts to survive in a changing land. The stories of these often-heroic people and their contributions to history can be explored at Kingsley Plantation.

SOLICITATION NUMBER:  N2011100137PROPOSED ISSUE DATE:  On or about June 18, 2010TITLE OF PROJECT:  Visitor and Research Center (VRC), Mesa Verde National Park
DESCRIPTION:  The National Park Service (NPS) will be constructing a new Visitor and Research Center (VRC) at Mesa Verde National Park.  The VRC will consist of one building, with two components:  the Research and Collection Facility and the Visitor Information Center (VIC).
The project has been registered with the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), and has been designed to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification.  The work of this contract consists of constructing a new highly energy efficient 23,620 SF building which includes 16,256 SF for the Research and Collection Facility (Curatorial Facility) and 7,364 SF for the Visitor Information Center.  The building will consist of tight construction to prevent air infiltration and provide strict climate control for the preservation of over 3 million artifacts.  The project is considered to be technically difficult due to the level of detail required for the architectural/building systems and finishes, coordination of multiple trades, and intensive commissioning services during construction.
The structure will utilize the latest sustainable materials and practices.  This project includes, to the maximum extent practicable, use of recycled content materials, recovered materials and regional materials.  The VRC will be a one-level structure constructed of poured-in-place concrete foundations, insulated masonry structural walls, steel beams and columns, multi-curved/multi-dimensional roof structure, membrane roofing, high performance insulation, fluid-applied membrane air barriers, stone veneer, ground source heat pumps, radiant heating and cooling, solar hot water, building automation system, fire protection, lighting controls, telecommunications, fire detection and security system, lightning protection, micro hydropower, photovoltaic, extensive commissioning, and site work.  Site work will include erosion control, excavation, grading, storm drainage, bringing utilities to the building site, coordination with local utility companies, on-site wastewater system, stone walls, accessible walkways, trellis work, native landscaping, landscape irrigation, miscellaneous site amenities, and parking/roadway construction.  The subgrade for the facility's access road and large parking bays has already been constructed.  Coordination with the commissioning agent, exhibit fabricator/installer, sculpture installer and mobile storage system installer is also required.
This project will have a defined construction time frame of approximately twenty-four (24) months.  Additionally, another Contractor working for the National Park Service will share one of the new parking bays with the Contractor for this project.  Coordination will be required. 
It is deemed imperative for successful award and performance of this contract that any firm considered must be experienced in construction of complex architectural building projects of similar magnitude, have successfully completed construction of energy efficient facilities using sustainable materials and practices to obtain LEED GOLD (minimum) certification, be competent with the documentation requirements to obtain this certification, and have successfully completed projects requiring close coordination.
TYPE OF PROCUREMENT: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately EQUAL in importance to price.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 15.300, the government will select the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the BEST VALUE to the government, price and technical and other factors considered.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; and permits discussions if necessary.  The government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the government to be the most advantageous to the government.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms from price, schedule and technical standpoint.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.

One (1) each Klein Model AUV 5000V2 Dynamically Focused Multi-Beam Side Scan Sonar comprised of:-  Sonar Processor Unit (SPU), installed in a stainless steel Pressure Housing, P/N 14104577-  Sonar Electronics Unit (SEU), installed in a stainless steel Pressure Housing, P/N 14104568-  Port Transducer Assembly w/ C-Channel strong back, P/N 14104648-  Starboard Transducer Assembly w/ C-Channel strong back, P/N 14104648-  Deck Power Supply, P/N 11700053-  Jumper Cable, 100 inch, P/N 12900916-01-  Deck Cable, 20m, P/N 14104595-  SonarPro (CD) Visualization Software License, P/N 14104488--  Manual (CD), P/N 11214513
This procurement is sole source for the following reasons:  This L-3 Klein Sonar is required for continued operation of a fielded system incorporating the previous version of this sonar system.  The form and fit of this new sonar is identical to that of the original system.  More importantly, the data stream from the new version of the system is identical to that of the existing system, maintaining full functional compatibility.  To change to any other sonar system at this time would require significant redesign efforts for the fielded system, in particular the processing of the data, which would negate any potential savings from attempting to competitively selecting a different sonar system.  The design of this system is proprietary to L-3 Klein, thus they are the only source for these systems.
The NAICS code is 334511 with a small business size standard of 750 employees and the FSC is 5845.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.  NSWC PCD contact is:  Scott Dubuque, 850-234-4864, Scott.Dubuque@navy.mil

<DESC>The Department of the Navy (DoN) is engaged in reducing the costs of acquiring commonly purchase furniture products by the application of a strategic sourcing solution. The DoN developed the acquisition strategy to enhance customer requirement fulfillment, improve the acquisition process, leverage department-wide purchasing power, and build vendor partnership. The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk (FISCN), Norfolk, VA in conjunction with the Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP), Mechanicsburg, PA is taking the lead to better manage DoN's acquisition processes for furniture. The DoN's objective for Spiral II of the Strategic Sourcing Initiative, based on the data received in Spiral I, is to recompete and establish multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with General Service Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract holders from Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) 71 - Furniture. The SINs for which the BPAs will be solicited for are listed below:
71 1	Packaged Offices 71 200	Dormitory and Quarters Packaged Rooms 71 204	Dormitory, Quarters and Residential Casegoods and Beds. Mattresses comply with applicable flammability requirements.71 301	Complete Daycare, Preschool and Classroom Solutions 71 310	Industrial and Institutional Furniture: Workbenches, Worktables, Warehouse Storage, and High Density Storage Cabinets, Modular Cabinets711 1	Furniture Systems and Workstation Clusters 711 2	Worksurfaces, Workstations, Computer Furniture and Accessories711 3	Filing and Storage Cabinets, Shelves, Mobile Carts, Dollies, Racks & Accessories - 711 8	Executive Office Furniture 
The Navy plans to award BPAs for each of the above SINs to vendors within the below regions:
1.	East CONUS: All areas within the CONUS that are east of the Mississippi2.	West CONUS: All areas within the CONUS that are West of the Mississippi3.	OCONUS: All areas outside the CONUS

The Navy will reserve the right to limit the number of BPAs due to the administrative burden and/or cost that would be associated with controlling the agreements.
The FISCN, Norfolk Contracting Department intends to conduct this competition through GSA e-Buy.  E-Buy is a simple online procurement tool that is designed to facilitate the request for and submission of quotes or proposals for commercial products, services, and solutions offered through GSA Federal Supply Schedules and Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs). 
Attached is a draft Request for Quote (RFQ)/Application which is intended to be posted to GSA e-Buy. Potential Vendors are encouraged to look through the RFQ/Application and provide positive and/or negative feedback as well questions relating to the RFQ/Application to the FISCN, Norfolk Contracting. Feedback and questions should be submitted to Andrew Hildebrandt, arthur.a.hildebrandt@navy.mil, and will be accepted until 4:00 PM Eastern Time on 15 June 2010. Be advised that individual questions and/or comments, received in response to this draft RFQ/Application will not receive individual responses. Rather, all questions/comments will be reviewed and taken into consideration in the issuance of the final, formal RFQ/Application.
The RFQ/Application will be issued in or around June 2010. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the RFQ/application and subsequent documents will only be available through the GSA e-Buy system, https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advgsa/advantage/ebuy/start_page.do. By submitting an application, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.

Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.edi.disa.mil. 
It is anticipated that the duration of the FSS BPAs will not exceed five years in length. The DoN intends to compete all FSS BPAs at the order level.

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><strong>The U.S. Department of the Treasury-The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP)</strong> is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating any technologies or materials with potential application in overt, visual authentication features in U.S. currency. <strong>Technologies offered should provide effective counterfeit deterrence against all types of threats, including both traditional printing and digital reproduction.</strong> Proposed features may be incorporated into the note (inks, substrate), or applied to the note, and should not require the use of any device for verification.<br /><br />Any technologies or materials submitted for consideration will be reviewed for <strong>inherent and relative effectiveness as a security feature, and may be further assessed for compatibility with design and production factors, durability, environmental acceptability, and other production/processing requirements</strong>. An effective feature is defined as a feature that cannot be easily simulated or duplicated; for example, a feature that can be simulated to approximate a passable outward appearance or response of a genuine feature is not effective or acceptable.
<p>Additionally, the Bureau is interested in reviewing products, materials, and technologies that will <strong>enhance the usefulness of currency notes</strong>; for example, authentication/denomination features for the visually impaired and enhancement of circulation life.</p>
<p>Current versions of currency paper and ink specifications, as well as durability testing procedures, are available upon written request.</p>
<p>The Bureau will only consider technologies or materials, for which at least laboratory feasibility has already been demonstrated (i.e., means a proven concept, can provide a sample). For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples and/or brief technical descriptions (1-2 paragraphs) plus price information for the purchase of larger test quantities to the <strong>BEP, Office of Acquisitions, Attn: Jules Tchoujan, 14th and C Streets, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20228-0001</strong>. <br />Larger quantities of samples may be procured through simplified acquisition (small purchase) for further assessment. The Bureau may submit offered technologies to outside technical experts under government contracts for their evaluation subject to the approval of the submitting party. Previously submitted materials or technologies need not be resubmitted. <br />If you have any questions please contact <strong>Jules Tchoujan on (202) 874-1182 or via e-mail at Jules.Tchoujan@bep.treas.gov</strong>.</p>

PROJECT DETAILS  This project will consist of bridge deck replacement on project AZ BOR CIBR 900(1),  located approximately 25 miles south of Blythe California, in La Paz County, AZ.  This project also consists of 1800 ft of widening on southbound US 93 on AZ BLM 93(1), Monolith Gardens Trailhead and Turnout, in Mohave County, Arizona.  The estimated price range for both projects is between $1,500,000 and $2,500,000.  

Lower Cibola Bridge Deck Replacement:
The Lower Cibola Bridge is located approximately 25 miles south of Blythe California, and approximately 100 miles north of Yuma, AZ.  The bridge spans across the Colorado River at River Mile 93.6 and is approximately 557 feet in length.  The bridge is wholly located in Arizona and within the Cibola National Wildlife Refuge.  

The project is for a deck replacement of the existing Lower Cibola Bridge.  Minor work included with the deck replacement are: replacement of the existing curb and railing across the bridge, paving approximately 100 feet of  the approaches to the bridge, guardrail installation at the bridge approaches, removal of road closure gates, replacement of navigation lighting,  installation of minor conduit, and jacketing the timber piles of the bridge.  There will be no substructure work other than the pile jacketing. 

The deck replacement will require the removal of the concrete deck, the steel railing, and existing minor conduit.  The removal of the deck will be tightly controlled; no explosives will be allowed or any heavy equipment to remove the slabs.  Deck removal will be by concrete saws and pneumatic or electric hammers of limited weights.  No debris will be allowed into the river. The Colorado River is a navigable waterway, and close coordination with the US Coast Guard will be required during construction.  

It is anticipated approximately 400 cuyds of concrete will be required for this project, approximately 100 tons of asphalt, approximately 1200 feet of steel bridge railing,  approximately 400 feet of guardrail, approximately 200 feet of pile jacketing, and over 1100 feet of conduit.  There is minor earthwork for installation of guardrail, approach road tie-ins, and general road reconditioning.  Minor turf establishment will be required for all disturbances as a result of the construction. The bridge will be closed during construction, however minor traffic control will be required. 

Pile jacketing will require an in depth underwater inspection of the piles and documented for the pile encapsulation. Underwater inspectors will be certified by the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) and will furnish all equipment, labor, licenses, permits, and insurance necessary to perform and complete the work.  Only a small percentage of pile encapsulation is anticipated, however and option will be included for all pile encapsulation should funding be available. 

Monolith Gardens:

The Monolith Gardens project consists of constructing approximately 1800 feet of acceleration and deceleration lane widening on southbound US 93 near milepost 69, approximately 3 miles northwest of Kingman Arizona.  The project also consists of reconstruction of the access to the BLM Monolith Gardens trailhead.  Principle work items include:  400 tons of asphalt pavement, 650 tons of aggregate base, 60 tons of asphalt friction course, 1,500 square yards of pavement milling, 200 cubic yards of roadway excavation, 750 feet of guardrail, and 1 cattle guard and metal gate.

It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in early July, 2010 with construction occurring from September, 2010 to February, 2011.

Estimated cost $1.5 to $2.5 million.

<DESC>Sources Sought for a Sodium Treatment System Design
The Department of Energy-Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID) is considering issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) as a small business set-a-side for the design of a Sodium Treatment System. Large and Small Business concerns may participate as teaming partners, provided that they meet the small business standards at FAR Part 19 and other applicable requirements.  Firms that are currently teaming partners under contract DE-AC07-05ID-14516 are excluded from participation in any award resulting from the subsequent RFP in accordance with FAR Part 9.
This system must be designed to treat remote-handled radiological waste containing primarily sodium and some sodium potassium (NaK) materials to render it non-reactive for disposal purposes. DOE-ID may issue a contract for partial system design with options for final design, fabrication and installation in an existing hot cell at the Idaho National Laboratory. 
The waste is in about 230 containers (including eight cold traps and two nuclide traps) with approximately 1,500 gallons of bulk sodium and 90 gallons of NaK in total. Dose readings on contact range from 0.1 millirem per hour up to 15,000 rem per hour. About 26 of the containers have transuranic constituents. The small qualified concern should have experience designing and installing similar systems that treat radiological waste with sodium and/or NaK, or be able to specifically demonstrate the capability to perform the work. 
If your firm is interested and you believe you are qualified, please provide the following:
1)	A statement describing the company?s interest in performing the work2)	Brief background of capabilities3)	Previous relevant experience4)	Demonstrated ability of treating radiological sodium and NaK containing waste5)	Primary contact person name with contact information.

<DESC>Summary: This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in support of the anticipated acquisition of the Department of Justice's Asset Forfeiture (AF) Program and Agency support for law enforcement related investigations (Solicitation No. DJJE-10-RFP-0662). This requirement will result in the award of an Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for nationwide support services to support the Asset Forfeiture Management Staff (AFMS).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing an elevated SENSOR MOUNTING FRAME that is capable of securely supporting multiple sensors and that provides easy re-adjustment of sensor locations. The SENSOR MOUNTING FRAME will need to extend around a lab perimeter of approximate dimensions 15 m (length) x 14 (width) 7.5 m (height) from the lab floor.  The platform will form a continuous closed loop around the lab perimeter but must not interfere with the labs existing gantry crane.  Sensors placed on the platform will be part of a larger Sensor Network used to support experiments in the Intelligent and Automated Construction Job Site (IACJS) test bed.

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a SENSOR MOUNTING FRAME that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

<SUBJECT>WALL SPECIMEN CARRIER NEEDED FOR RF TESTING
<SOLNBR>AMD-10-SS77
<RESPDATE>061410
<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a wall specimen carrier to aid in wall penetration radar investigation.  NIST is researching how radar behaves as it penetrates common exterior wall materials and needs a means of holding these wall specimens upright during testing without interfering with the tests.

After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a wall specimen carrier that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

NIST has a need for a wall specimen carrier that meets the following requirements:

THE TESTS
Common wall elements like brick, wood, drywall and insulation ext. are to be layered in different combinations to simulate common residential and commercial exterior walls. These specimens are to be placed into a carrier frame to keep the specimens upright, gently compressed together and safely secured from falling over. Test will consist of sending a radar signal though the layers and recording the return signal.

THE CARRIER
The carrier must hold specimens having overall dimensions after layering of approximately 40x40 square and anywhere from 4 to 18 thick. Thin and lightweight elements such as foam insulation are to be placed into the carrier by hand but heavier layers like precast concrete sections weighing approximately 1,000 lbs will be lowered into place by an overhead gantry crane. The carrier must be able to handle these heavy samples safely while having the smallest floor space footprint as possible. The carrier must be able to be easy loaded and unloaded between tests without harm to the samples. The carrier MUST NOT INTERFERE WITH RADAR; non-metallic dielectric materials like fiberglass and plastics will generally accomplish this. We also have a need for another carrier to neatly store and organize all the samples in-betweens tests. This storage device would be larger than the carrier used for the tests but it would not have to be radar transparent and could be made out of any suitable material. 


NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture such systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

FAR 52.204-11  American Recovery and Reinvestment ActReporting Requirements. 
As prescribed in 4.1502, insert the following clause: 
AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACTREPORTING REQUIREMENTS (MAR 2009) 
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause 
Contract, as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. 
First-tier subcontract means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act. 
Jobs created means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as full-time equivalent (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 
Jobs retained means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as full-time equivalent (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 
Total compensation means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractors past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)): 
(1) Salary and bonus. 
(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments. 
(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. 
(4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. 
(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. 
(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000. 
(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public. 
(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter. 
(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at   www.FederalReporting.gov. 
(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable. 
(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period. A cumulative amount from all the reports submitted for this action will be maintained by the governments on-line reporting tool. 
(3) A list of all significant services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor invoiced in this calendar quarter. 
(4) Program or project title, if any. 
(5) A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract, including significant deliverables and, if appropriate, associated units of measure. 
(6) An assessment of the contractors progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act. 
(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractors workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide 
(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractors existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and 
(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained. 
(8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if 
(i) In the Contractors preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received 
(A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and

(9) For subcontracts valued at less than $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual, or subcontracts awarded to a subcontractor that in the previous tax year had gross income under $300,000, the Contractor shall only report the aggregate number of such first tier subcontracts awarded in the quarter and their aggregate total dollar amount. 
(10) For any first-tier subcontract funded in whole or in part under the Recovery Act, that is over $25,000 and not subject to reporting under paragraph 9, the contractor shall require the subcontractor to provide the information described in (i), (ix), (x), and (xi) below to the contractor for the purposes of the quarterly report. The contractor shall advise the subcontractor that the information will be made available to the public as required by section 1512 of the Recovery Act.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:
The U.S. Department of States Office of Fine Arts (M/FA) requires conservation of its Fine Art Collections.  This collection encompasses nearly 500 fine works of art by prominent American artists over the period of 1780-2009.  The works include sculpture, works on paper, and paintings.  This Statement of Work addresses M/FAs immediate requirement for conservation of its paintings, or works of art on canvas and/or board.  These works are shown to members of the public and on display during official events, and conservation must address both the work of art as well as its antique frame. 
The potential source must be an experienced conservation firm with each principle conservator having over twenty years of experience.  The contractor must demonstrate extensive experience working for major museum collections (over 10 collections) in the conservation of important American paintings.  In addition to a full-time staff, at least three principal staff members must have a Masters degree in Art Conservation from an accredited institution.  Contractor must be a professional member or fellow of the American Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) and adhere to the AIC Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice.  Contractor should have extensive, broad-based experience specifically with 18th- and 19th-century American paintings.  Work must be done by principals in the firm and similarly-experienced staff under their direct supervision.  The conservator(s) should be familiar with current trends in conservation and with professional practices relating to historic works of art.    
Conservation projects will be undertaken in the contractors conservation laboratory/studio/facility.  This space must be equipped to perform a wide range of conservation treatments on paintings, pigments and/or historic colorants, and other historic materials.  Activities will include, but not be limited to, on-going conservation of paintings and all associated materials overseen by M/FA in the Harry S Truman building and its subsidiary locations.   General requirements and activities are as follows:
(a.)	Paintings:  The Contractor will perform annual, on-site assessments of M/FAs works of art.  These assessments will analyze each object for surface condition (state of varnish, prior conservation treatments, etc.) and make recommendations for treatment (removal of accumulated dust and/or grime, consolidation of flaking paint, and/or in-painting areas of paint loss).  The Contactor will provide written report(s), identifying those works of art requiring conservation and outlining conservation methods and/or treatment approaches for those works of art. 
(b.)	Frames:  The Contractor will perform on-site assessments of M/FAs historic frame collection.  These assessments will analyze each object for overall condition and make recommendations for conservation treatment.  The contractor will provide interim uncomplicated repairs to the frames as nec
(c.)	Methodology of Fine Art Conservation:  All conservation treatments should adhere to the guidelines for the AIC Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice.  The Contractor will honor M/FAs commitment of preserving and protecting the integrity and completeness of historic works by using the non-intrusive, reversible conservation methods.  Original elements should be preserved, where possible, with the artifact.  Treatments include, but are not limited to, stabilizing flaking surface pigments and colorants, removing prior conservation attempts, and mitigating damage through restorative measures (in-painting and/or pigment consolidation). 
(d.)	Conservation Laboratory/Studio/Facility:  The Contractor will maintain an off-site facility, where works of art may be removed for care and conservation (see also item (g.) below).  (d.1.) The facility must have a Bank Vault (approx. 400 cubic ft) on premises for securing and safeguarding high-value fine works of art.  (d.2.) The facility must be alarmed with a ULA3 Security System.  (d.3.) The facility should have a microscope for close examination and thorough treatment.  
(e.)	Documentation: In accordance with AIC Standards of Practice, the Contractor must provide detailed documentation of conservation treatments, which will be maintained in M/FAs archival records.  The documentation will take the form of electronic reports with photographic illustrations of the object before, during, and after conservation. 
(f.)	Transportation:  The Contractor must provide transportation of paintings and frames to and from the Department of State.  For exceptionally large paintings, the Contractor may use a moving and storage company approved of by M/FA.  Any vehicle provided by the Contractor for the transportation must be alarmed to protect against theft of the vehicle as well as theft of artwork inside the vehicle.   
(g.)	Location: To facilitate collaboration and cooperation between M/FAs Curatorial Team and the Contractors professional staff, the conservation laboratory/studio/facility must be located within 20 miles of The Diplomatic Reception Rooms (2201 C Street, NW Washington, DC 20520).  Location within the District of Columbia area is preferred. 
 (h.) 	Emergency Response:  In cases of emergency, the Contractor must guarantee 24-hour, rapid response during an emergency situation, and agree to provide M/FA with a recovery plan within 24 hours of first contact.  Contractor must demonstrate experience working with historic collections that have experienced damage due to fire, water, and/or natural disaster.  Prompt response time is required in case of emergency. 
(i.) 	Consultation: (i.1.) The Contractor will be knowledgeable of AIC Standards of Practice, advising M/FA on preparing fine works of art for transportation in traveling exhibitions as requested.  (i.2.) The Contractor will provide consultation concerning recording of visible and ultraviolet light levels, where historic paintings are displayed in the Diplomatic Reception Rooms.  (i.3.) The Contractor will make recommendations for long-term collections care and maintenance.    
(j.)	Technical analysis:  The Contractor will perform a technical evaluation during conservation of paintings, which will include pigment & fiber identification and ultraviolet microscopy of surface layers, if requested by M/FA.  
(k.) 	Subcontracting:  If there is a need to subcontract special projects, or subcontract for specialized assistance on normally routine projects, the subcontractor must be pre-approved by the U.S. Department of State.  M/FA will provide the Contractor with the names of approved subcontractors for specialized projects involving gilding, historic frames, and works on paper.

<a href="mailto:susan.coyner@us.army.mil">USACE District, Alaska</a>
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  NO SOLCITATION IS AVAILABLE. The Alaska District Corps of Engineers intends to specify proprietary and/or sole source equipment known as Intelligent Parking Lot Controllers (ILPC) developed and marketed by Vantera Incorporated of Manitoba, Canada in solicitations for the construction of various installation facilities on Fort Greely, Fort Wainwright and Fort Richardson, Alaska during fiscal year 2011.  No solicitation will be available as this sole source item will be incorporated into the specifications of FY11 solicitations for new Military Construction (MILCON) facilities on Fort Greely, Fort Wainwright and Fort Richardson, however, all information received within 15 days of this publication will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Reference FAR 6.302-1(c), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The ILPC is a smart power receptacle that can be used in lieu of a standard parking stall power outlet. It incorporates a microprocessor, temperature sensors and red/green LED lights to indicate the status of the system. It measures temperature and wind chill and is factory programmed to automatically regulate the optimum power flow to ensure strong starts at any temperature. The intelligent operation reduces electrical consumption costs by up to 65 percent. Each IPLC handles two outlets and each can be individually programmed to prevent use of in-car heaters or to meet the special needs of diesel engines or emergency vehicles. Red/green LEDs instantly indicate the status of the power outlet and user equipment including: a live outlet, a functioning block heater, an open or short circuit in the block heater or a circuit overload from an in-car heater. Salient features of the product include: 1. Automatically controls the amount of electricity supplied based on ambient air temperature and wind chill factor. 2. Totally programmable via computer software to vary the amount of electricity supplied based on temperature. 3. Built-in microprocessor which keeps track of energy consumed with or without the use of the controller and provision to download data from the microprocessor. 4. Identifies problems with open circuit or circuit overload via LEDs or other means. 5. Temperature rating of -55C to 225C.  The Alaska District Corps of Engineers requests interested manufacturers to respond with their capabilities and marketing materials that identify the features of the equipment. The clause Buy American Act - Construction Materials under Trade Agreements will apply to this item.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST TO PURCHASE THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL. As part of an FY11 AAC Hangar design-build construction project on Fort Wainwright, Alaska, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District intends to include a sole source specification for a MEGADOOR hangar door system. The Government requires aircraft hangar doors that open vertically, resist infiltration, are insulated and are comprised of multiple sections which may be operated individually or in groups. The overall hangar door opening, with all doors open, will be approximately 436 feet wide by a minimum of 28 feet tall. The hangar door opening will have six (6) to eight (8) separate door sections with retractable vertical mullions. The vertical opening doors eliminate the need for lateral door pockets and rails and/or floor tracks which are required with sliding doors and are problematic with the ice and snow conditions in Fairbanks, Alaska. The doors shall be double-fabric doors with horizontal stiffeners to provide structural resistance to wind loading, resistance to infiltration, thermal performance of R-3 minimum and a pliability range of approximately -31F to 158F. A series of multiple doors with swing-up mullions is required to provide the Army with maximum flexibility in housing a variety of aircraft sizes and configurations while limiting exposure of the hangar bay to environmental elements. Sources able to meet the above criteria are requested to respond to this notice by&nbsp;June 24, 2010.&nbsp; All sources must be able to meet the domestic or trade agreements restrictions contained under FAR 52.225-11 Buy American Act-Construction Materials under Trade Agreements.

<DESC>Introduction
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for the development of a functional prototype in support of the development of a wireless voice communications with hands free and sterile field options.  
Background
Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.      VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  
Current communications within VA medical centers is based on an inefficient  hub-and-spoke model relying on multiple communication tools such as pagers, overhead paging, stationary phones, and yelling down the hall way.  This process is inefficient, counterproductive and most of all, disruptive to patient care.
Requirements
1.	VA intends to contract for an Analysis of Alternatives that provides the best solution for a wireless personal communication system for instant communications to individuals, specific roles, or action teams.  The communication and workflow of this system shall be decentralized to expedite key information exchange.  The communication shall be able to be received and initiated at point of care, as well as, being direct and on demand.

2.	The successful vendor for this prototype shall provide a workflow analysis to identify key communications processes, coordination at the point of care, and critical alerts and alarms.  Solutions for call flow, grouping, permissions, and data collection shall be configured.  Testing and final demonstration of the solution will be required.
3.	Communication devices must have ability to be used in a sterile environment.  For example, devices shall have the capability for voice recognition or hands free capability to easily respond orally to a call during a surgical procedure and conform to a sterile environment enhancing communications without disruption and, or contamination to a sterile field.
4.	Wireless communications system shall able to utilize the VA's IEEE 802.11 wireless infrastructure (WLAN protocols and standards) and devices shall also be NIST FIPS 140-2 compliant.
5.	These communication devices shall permit broadcast communications to appropriate action teams (Rapid Response Teams) and notified of the key or critical actions the Team must follow without relying on multiple mediums of other communications, such as, (cell phones/blackberry with the assumption someone will answer), pagers (requiring people to rely on a callback process to disseminate info), electronic mail (not conducive to clinical workflow as people are not in front of computers). 
6.	The successful system shall provide a mechanism to improve communications between VA medical centers when deployed to multiple VA's; VA medical centers/clinics will be able to leverage services and offer health care and support services to other VA medical centers/clinics that are in need.  These instruments shall include the ability to place and receive calls using the VA Medical Center's telephone system (Private Branch Exchange (PBX)).  For example, a VA Medical Center or Clinic that does not have a particular specialist on site may send a message to another VA Medical Center or Clinic for medical consultation or simple and instant communication between the healthcare specialist and the VA Medical Center/Clinic that is requesting support.
7.	The successful system shall be scalable to install on a per facility basis.  The current prototype objective is to install in 3 VA medical centers.  The innovation VA medical center locations are:
a.	Martinsburg, WV, VA Medical Center - 197 beds
b.	Baltimore, MD, VA Medical Center - 137 beds
c.	Havre De Grace, MD, VA Medical Center - 264 beds

<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST 
DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY 
VA Medical Center 
Lincoln, NE
SCOPE AND NETWORK OBJECTIVES 
The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) under its Enhanced-Use Leasing (EUL) authority (38 U.S.C.  8161  8169), is seeking expressions of interest from bidders interested in a development opportunity to redevelop, construct, renovate and/or maintain either all or the majority of the campus at the Lincoln VA Medical Center.  This will be accomplished through a long-term out-lease of either all or the majority of the VAMC campus.  For consideration of the use of the campus, VA seeks an outpatient clinic of approximately 100,000 square feet, located on the campus or at another site proposed by the Offeror.  

Two options are offered for bidders to consider in response to this expression of interest:
Option 1:  	VA vacates the entire campus and all buildings.  The entire 60 acres plus all eight buildings are transferred.  The bidder provides options for the location of the outpatient clinic off-site.   
Option 2:	VA retains acreage to support the outpatient clinic and parking (estimated 10 to 20 acres).  The remaining 40 to 50 acres plus all eight buildings are transferred. 
The development may include any use that is commercially viable and not inconsistent with the mission of VA.  VA will not continue to occupy the existing community based outpatient clinic (CBOC) under this transaction and is not interested in renovations for continued occupancy of the clinic.
Through this EUL authority, VA can offer a long-term use of assets (up to 75 years) in order to accommodate the scope of the project.  In return for VAs out-leasing of the property, the developer/lessee would be solely responsible for developing, financing, renovating, constructing, managing, maintaining, and operating the leased property.  In return for the long-term use of the assets, the developer/operator will provide fair consideration to the Lincoln VAMC in the form of ground rent or in-kind consideration toward construction of a 100,000 square foot community based outpatient clinic. 
BACKGROUND 
The Lincoln VAMC is located within the city limits of Lincoln, NE in a built-up and desirable commercial, retail and residential neighborhood.  The total property includes 59.70 acres of gently rolling land situated at the southeast corner of South 70th Street and O Street within the city limits of Lincoln, NE.  
There are eight physical structures on the campus although numbered as 22 buildings, most built between 1929 and 1931, with some updates and areas renovated.  All buildings are brick construction.  The most recent construction occurred in 1984 for the outpatient clinic (Building 45).  The total building square footage is 276,000 SF gross building area, with many areas closed or taken out of service.  The largest building is the main hospital.  Historic preservation will apply.
The Medical Center has administrative, clinic and Veteran outreach services.  The existing CBOC provides primary care services, behavior health services, specialty care referrals, pharmacy and laboratory services.  There is a Vet Center on campus.  VAMC Lincoln is part of the VA Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System and provides services to apopulation of166,700 veterans living in a 104-county area of Nebraska, western Iowa and portions of Kansas and Missouri.
DEVELOPER ELIGIBILITY 
VA is seeking qualified development teams that have a proven track record in mixed-use development, historic preservation and/or reuse and operation of such facilities. Developers may be either sole entities or grouped as teams to produce qualified responses.
RESPONSES
Responses must address the following in sufficient detail to frame the opportunity and the ability to execute an enhanced-use lease in a timely manner and competently:  (1) organization and ownership structure responding to the REI, including anticipated teaming arrangements; (2) relevant project experience of equivalent scope and complexity performed by the development team, its partners or other entities envisioned to be key to the project, including historic preservation experience; (3) preliminary concept for re-use/redevelopment of the campus, including location of the outpatient clinic; (4) preliminary concepts for in-kind consideration; (5) constraints or challenges envisioned to execute VAs vision for the campus and CBOC; and (6) ability to obtain financing for the project. 
Responses must not exceed the page count for each of the sections, the aggregate of which is limited to 10 pages, single spaced with a minimum 12 point font.  Please do not create an elaborate response to this request.  Bulleted outlined responses are acceptable.

<DESC>Please read the ENTIRE synopsis before submitting any response.<br />DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME.
<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has a Brand Name Only requirement for the purchase of Dell PowerEdge R710 Hard Drives, Dell PowerEdge R410 Hard Drives, EDT VMWare Implementation, Installation of a Dell Server, WinSvrStd 2008R2, and WinSvrEnt 2008R2. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41, 13 April 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334111 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The USAF Academy has a Brand Name Only requirement to purchase Dell Professional 1909W, Widescreen, 19 in Viewable Image LCD Monitors. Dell LCD Monitors have been approved by the 10th Communications Squadron as the standard across the USAFA .mil network. Per AFNetOps Functional Concepts, para 6.5, "Standardization of configurations, processes, and applications across the enterprise, from the gateway to the desktop, will facilitate centralized management, enhance security through configuration control, and save manpower in certification and accreditation, patch implementation, hardware/software upgrades and asset tracking." Also per para 6.1, "Robust, redundant data paths and nodes with both physical and logical diversity are needed to maximize effectiveness and eliminate single points of failure. This will enable the integration of distributed capabilities, improve real-time detection/correlation of network anomalies, and give the AFNetOps Commander a comprehensive picture of any potential network degradation, outage, or attack. As importantly, it will help the NetOps community better understand the impact of network actions and the war-fighting operations that rely on their support."</p>
<p>This guidance lends itself to procuring, configuring and maintaining one standard platform per network that can be cannibalized if necessary, switched out with no impacts and easily repaired physically or remotely when needed. Also, a single platform makes the process of tracking products under warranty more efficient. To maintain continuity within its system, the Academy has 2 Dell Certified Technicians (GS Civilians) who are authorized to work on all Dell systems. Those techs are given priority at Dell and are authorized overnight turnaround for Dell parts ordered.</p>
<p>The Academy server farm is standardized on Microsoft Operating Systems, ensuring continuity of training for our Network Administration staff. Limited platforms enable fast and accurate troubleshooting and reduce training overhead.</p>
<p>Although other brands, such as HP or IBM would meet our need from a technological standpoint, they incur much greater complexity for management and administration, due to the increasing number of discrete hardware platforms and the fact that USAFA has multiple independent networks. In addition, purchasing other brands would not meet the guidance of the AFNetOps Functional Concepts described above.</p>
<p>By standardizing on Dell, we are able to manage and administer multiple networks, multiple platforms and the associated training and troubleshooting tasks that are unique to each. Standardizing on Dell to support our machines with Microsoft operating systems enable our technicians to do more with less in an ever-changing technological environment.</p>
<p>Delivery is to be made to IT Accountability 5136 Community Center Drive East Loading Dock at the U.S. Air Force Academy.<br />FOB: Destination. <br />Unique Item Identifier (UID) [DFARS 252.211] applies to this requirement.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they have an equal product that meets all of the features and functionality of the Dell PowerEdge R710 and R410 Servers may provide EVIDENCE for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim they can provide an equal product. It is the offerors responsibility to prove their product is an equal by demonstrating their product, at a minimum, has the same features and functionality of the brand name product. Providing brochures, specifications and/or quotes alone is not enough for the Government to make a decision. The offeror should provide an understandable comparison between the two products. The Government is not responsible for developing the comparison from insufficient information provided. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a brand name or equal procurement can be conducted. A determination that equal products exist based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received 12:00 pm NOON Mountain Standard Time (MST) on 8 June 2010. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated. <br /><br />The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis. Contractors must have a current registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>Questions should be addressed to the Primary POC Karen Jackson, Contract Specialist, (719) 333-4060 or sent via e-mail to karen.jackson@usafa.af.mil. Alternate POC is Diana Myles-South, Contracting Officer, (719) 333-8650, diana.myles-south@usafa.af.mil.</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,</p>
<p>Kelly Snyder<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: kelly.snyder@usafa.af.mil</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Distribution Center (DDC) intends to issue a modification to Contract SP3100-05-C-0020 with Agility/PWC for the extension of distribution services at the Defense Distribution Depot Kuwait, Southwest Asia in support the Central Command Area of Operation.  This is a modification to the existing competitively awarded contract and is an interim effort to provide distribution support services for an estimated period of performance of 1 September 2010 through 28 February 2011.  The contract modification will extend the current contract for a contractor owned contractor operated distribution facility. The estimated six month extension is required to ensure sufficient time for transition and movement of DLA managed material from the current contractor (Agility/PWC) owned facility to a new location to be determined under the competitive solicitation SP330010R0020.  This contract effort will allow for continuous service while the solicitation (SP330010R0020) for a new contract is negotiated, reviewed, approved, and awarded, and while DLA managed material is transitioned from the current facility to a new facility.  This announcement is for a sole source procurement to Agility/PWC under FAR 6.302-1, "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. Information received, if any, will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses are due no later than the 2:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time, on the fifteenth day after publication of this synopsis.  Email responses to Brenda Delawder, Contract Specialist, at Brenda.Delawder@dla.mil.

4.  Authority Cited:  Identify the statutory authority, FAR title and FAR citation permitting other than full and open competition.  It may be one of the following.
     1  (a)  10 USC 2304(c)(1) or 41 USC 253(c)(1); FAR 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Use of this authority may be appropriate in situations such as the following, unique supplies or services available from only one source, the existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw material, or utility services or when circumstances may dictate that only one supplier can furnish the service.
     0  (b)  10 USC 2304(c)(2) or 41 USC 253(c)(2); FAR 6.302-2:  Unusual and 	compelling urgency.  When the agency's need for the supplies or services is of 	such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources 	from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.  This statutory authority requires that agencies shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.
     0  (c)  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5); FAR 6.302-5:  Authorized or Required by Statute.  This authority may be used when statutes, such as the following, expressly authorize or require that acquisition be made from a specified source or through another agency: Federal Prison Industries 	(UNICOR); Qualified Nonprofit Agencies for the Blind or other Severely Disabled; Government Printing and Binding; and Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program, HUBZone Act of 1997, Veterans Benefits Act of 2003.  
5.  Reason for Authority Cited: State why this is the only source that can provide the required supplies or services.
  (a)  Services can only be provided from the original source as this is a follow-on requirement for the continued provision of highly specialized services. FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii).
 X  (b)  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (A).
   (c)  Services/Supplies are needed immediately to satisfy mission requirements and unacceptable delays will result when an award is made to any other source.  FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) (B).

Additional Information:(i)  What harm will come to the Government if desired supplies/services are not provided on time?     
(ii)  What harm will come to the Government if desired contractor doesn't receive the award?Overall cost and repair time will increase due to only other John Deere authorized repair facility is located more than twice the distance from refuge.  Distance will require a minimum of two additional transport time and associated additional transport expenses.  
6.  Actions to Increase Competition: (State what actions will be taken to increase competition before subsequent acquisition of the supplies or services is required.)     
7.  Market Survey:  (Describe the extent of the market survey conducted to identify all qualified sources and the results thereof.  "Market Survey" is defined as those attempts you made to ascertain whether other qualified sources exist.  The survey of the market place may consist of written, telephonic, or world wide web inquiries.)A search of qualified John Deere repair facilities was conducted via the world wide web.  The nearest qualified vendor was Quality Equipment which owns four of the five repair facilities within 100 mile radius.  Previous experience and repairs through Quality Equipment have proven overall best value for Government.
8.  Procurement History:
	Previous Contract or Purchase Order Number:        or 1  N/A	Previously competed?	0  N/A	1  No		0  Yes	Previous authority for less than Full & Open Competition:  N/A

<DESC>IT IS THE INTENT OF THE MISSOURI ARMY NATIONAL GUARD TO AWARD A CONTRACT TO DELTA STATE UNIVERSITY FOR GEOSPATIAL MAPPING DESIGN AND BUILD THROUGH SOLE SOURCE PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN FAR 6.302-1 FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:<BR><BR>1.  The Office of NGMO-INT-ZB is requesting approval to sole source contract with Delta State University.  Below justification for Delta State University:   <BR><BR>The 8.5 x 11 US National Grid atlas product by the Center for Interdisciplinary Geospatial Information Technologies at Delta State University is still one that is new and unique.  This product was developed in partnership with the USGS and is not yet a part of their available product series, nor is it available from a commercial vendor.  There are several factors that make the atlas unique and that limit production to our facility at this point:<BR><BR>1.  No single software solution does it all.  We have worked with numerous GIS and cartography software vendors to integrate USNG into their software products with great success.  However, multiple software products are required to create the atlas and thus far, our facility is the only one that has mastered this.<BR>2.  Standards-based product.  Our layout and design is unique because it meets a complete spectrum of International, Federal, and State standards for map products.  This includes those set forth by the Department of Defense and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.<BR>3.  The Center will utilize data provided by Missouri from disparate sources and integrate it to create a seamless, state-wide product.<BR>4.  The Center will provide training and education as a core component of this project.  This will allow MO USARNG to become self-sufficient in the production of this atlas product.<BR><BR>ALL INQUIRIES SHOULD BE MADE TO RYAN.BORGMEYER@US.ARMY.MIL WITHIN 15 DAYS OF THIS POSTING.

However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Gina.E.Lee@noaa.gov by June 18, 2010. Award will be made using FAR 13, Simplified acquisition procedures, current through FAC 2005-41. The determination to compete or not compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Reference NWWG0170-10-12696 for this action.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<br /></span></strong><br />The purpose of this modification 2 to Task Order 1103 is to (1) extend the period of performance of the task order until July 31, 2010 and (2) add to Task 2 of the task order two (2) case studies. The first case study topic concerns how energy efficiency green projects were funded in the state of New York. The second case study topic concerns how several utilities are using the green reserve as a step on the path the becoming "energy independent."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no increase to the cost ceiling of the task order as a result of these changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>Sandia desires to license its patent "Variable Focal Length Deformable Mirror" (US 7,229,178) to companies that are positioned to develop this technology into a market-ready product.  The technology is used to correct for distortions in laser beams by using pressure to deform a single mirror to change the convexity or concavity of the reflecting surface.  It offers a viable way to correct for low order beam distortions (focus or de-focus) and can serve as an alternative to more expensive adaptive optics systems, which correct for higher order aberrations.  The technology has been implemented internally in Sandia's Z-Beamlet and Z-Petawatt Laser http://www.z-beamlet.sandia.gov/research/optics.html<br /><br /><br />
<p>The focal length of the deformable mirror is variable from many meters to a few cm and can be used in any application requiring the focusing or de-focusing of light, including both coherent and incoherent sources, for both on- and off-axis focusing. The technology has been featured in the world news section of Laser Focus World, vol. 43(2) as well as several peer reviewed papers, e.g. Applied Physics B, vol. 82, pp. 275-281, 2006.</p>
<p>Sandia is making the technology available to companies interested in licensing or participating in a cooperative research and development agreement to advance a specific application. For consideration, please contact Jack Euske, ph (925) 294-2646, jeuske@sandia.gov by email no later than June 30, 2010</p>

<DESC>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the 'Act'), Public Law 111-5, this notice is provided for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), intends to modify established contract number G10PC00094 awarded to Sha-Nic.Inc. Under Clause 52.243-05 Changes and Changed Conditions. The project described below is within scope of the existing contract, which was originally awarded on a competitive basis. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE INCUMBENT CONTRACTOR.  Contract # G10PC00094, Dollar Value of This Action is $26,752.00 to install a complete Sprinkler. 
1. Identification of the Agency and Contracting Office:
    Department of the Interior, U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), Eastern Region     Eastern Region Acquisition and Grants Branch
2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:
The U.S. Geological Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (PWRC) located at 12311 Beech Forest Rd Laurel, MD has a requirement for the addition of a complete and working Sprinkler System in the Duplex #3, which is ARRA Project #CO0001E currently under contract with Sha-Nic, Inc. (Contract # G10PC00094).  Sha-Nic, the General Contractor (GC), is constructing a modular type Duplex built in a factory by their Sub-contractor/supplier, Apex Homes.  The home arrives on PWRC in four pieces complete with all electric, plumbing, heat/air conditioning, kitchen/bath fixtures, cabinets, drywall installed/finished and painted.  The foundation and all underground utilities are completed prior to the home arriving on PWRC and the home is placed on the foundation, assembled, utilities are connected and any finish work necessary to make the home ready for occupancy by the GC, Sha-Nic. Due to the construction process of the modular type home, the Sprinkler System needs to be designed and installed at their factory.  This code requirement was identified post award since the Government was not aware of Prince Georges Co MD, 2007 NFPA 13R, Sprinkler Systems in Residential Occupancies up to Four Stories in Height regulation at the time.  Sha-Nic will provide and install a complete and working Sprinkler System in the Duplex #3 within the 180 day contract period.
3. Description of Supplies and Services Required:	
The following work was not anticipated at the time of award due to the fact the Government was not aware an exemption for the Sprinkler System requirement was no longer valid.  The Statement of Work (SOW) utilized for this solicitation mirrored the SOW used by the US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) when constructing two modular type Duplex residences adjacent to where the Duplex #3 will be built.  The existing two Duplexes were built when the exemption was relevant for federal property residential construction prior to the 2007 NFPA 13R Code update.  
USFWS, who is the land owner at PWRC, has directed USGS to have the residential sprinklers installed per Prince Georges Co. MD Building Code Regulations.  USFWS' Safety Department has also concurred and expressed that PWRC should follow all applicable local codes, even if they are stricter.  The Prince George's County Fire Marshall's office has also indicated that residential sprinklers are required for new construction, and there are no exemptions for residences on Federal property. 
The local requirements for sprinklers have more to do with the variances in State and local codes. Prince Georges County specifically passed a law that all new residences shall have sprinklers systems. The goal of a residential sprinkler system is life safety for the building occupants. They are designed to keep a typical residential fire in check, so the occupants can safely exit the residence. 
The scope for the needed change to be performed at the home builders' factory is listed below;a.	System Design per NFPA 13R, with necessary Stamp/Approvalb.	Installation of approx. (42) forty-two concealed/recessed pendant sprinkler heads with related pipe, fittings and accessoriesc.	System Testing and Certificationd.	Provide/Install Backflow Preventer and Riser Manifolde.	Provide/Install Fire Department Connection (FDC)f.	Provide/Install Check Valve with Electric BellThe scope for the needed change to be performed by Sha-Nic is listed below;a.	Increase Water Supply Piping from 1-1/2 inch to 2 inchb.	Final Connection to both units in the Duplexc.	Install FDC to Exterior of the Duplexd.	Final Testing and Certification
The contractor team will provide appropriate labor, management, supervision and coordination time for the additional work efforts identified above.
4. Identification of Statutory Authority:
FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2)(i) - 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy the requirements.
5. Purpose:  
    Engage Sha-Nic to Manage the Construction Project, Coordinate the Installation of the Sprinkler System by the Sub-Contractor/Supplier and provide all connections, testing and inspections.  6. Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited:
USGS has awarded contract # G10PC00094 dated 03/24/10 to Sha-Nic, Inc. to construct the Duplex#3 complete and ready for occupancy for an amount of $393,800.  Due to local Prince Georges County building codes noted above, all residences in the county are to be protected by a sprinkler system; Sha-Nic provided Change Order #1 on 04/12/10 for this service for an amount of $26,752, to be incorporated into the existing contract and will increase the amount to $420,552.
There will be tremendous time delays and a significant increase in cost to install a sprinkler system in Duplex #3 after the building arrives on site within the contract period of 180 days. The walls and ceilings would have the drywall removed to install the new sprinkler system, and then new drywall would be put back, finished and painted.  The approximate cost to the government to complete this work after the building arrives by a separate contractor would be $50,000, twice the amount to have it completed during the manufacturing phase.  There would also be additional Government oversight, testing and inspections.  The requisite testing and inspections would be completed by the home builder and would ensure Quality Assurance/Quality Control and less waste to take to a land fill.  In order to avoid the additional time and cost to the government associated with having a separate contractor perform the sprinkler installation, Sha-Nic is the only source recommended to execute the above described services.    
7. Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers will be Solicited From Many Potential Sources as is Practicable:
An announcement of intent to make a noncompetitive award to Sha-Nic, Inc. will be posted on FedBizOpps for a period of 3 days. 
8. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost to the Government:
The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  A preliminary cost/price analysis has been performed on the estimated costs for Sha-Nic to oversee the project.  The change/modification represents a 6.8% increase to the original contract amount.  An increase of this value id considered within scope and funds are available.
9. Description of the Market Survey:  
   Market Research was completed utilizing RS Means, Building Construction Cost Data 2010 for estimating and historical data of similar projects in Prince Georges County.
10. Support Data:        2007 NFPA 13R, Sprinkler Systems for Residential Occupancies up to 4 Stories 
11. List of Sources Expressing an Interest in Writing:  None.
12. Actions to Remove or Overcome Barriers to Competition:       All future requirements will be competed to the maximum extent possible.      Future statement of work for similar construction requirements in Prince George County, Maryland will include the sprinkler system code for a new residence/dwelling.
13. Certifications: 
(a) Project Officer's CertificationI hereby certify that the supporting data that pertains to the technical/requirements information contained in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Full or partial funding for requirements to be completed by the contractor will utilize funds provided by the Act.  Inclusion of unique provisions required to implement the Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency requirements, is required.  (ATN #CO00001EM)

<DESC>Introduction
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or, could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement for time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Reducing Health Care Associated Infections Using Informatics (#291VHA/OI&TI).   
Background
Veterans Health Administration together with VA's Office of Information and Technology is sponsoring an Information Technology Innovation Program.  VA intends to retain its  "innovative spirit" among those employees involved with medical informational technology support and developed the Health Information Technology Program to strengthen this important aspect.  VA selected 26 innovations prototypes for development out of 6500 submissions.  These innovation prototypes will undergo an evaluation of the functional prototype which may result in further development for a VA-wide deployment.  
The Reducing Health Care Associated Infections Using Informatics program is one of the 26 innovations selected for prototype and evaluation.   Medical devices e.g., central venous catheters (bloodstream infections), endotracheal tubes (ventilator associated pneumonia) and urinary catheters (urinary tract infections) are the primary risk factor for the development of health care associated infections in hospitalized patients.  VA currently obtains medical device use data primarily using manual methods (i.e., medical record review) which is a process that is labor intensive and error prone. The development of a prototype for an automated electronic method to identify health care associated infections and to measure rates across VHA will be transformational and greatly enhance health care associated infections surveillance.
VA's Veteran Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system is developed in M-Technology; it is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VHA facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  
Requirements
VA intends to contract for a solution that will develop and investigate multiple plausible automated electronic methods to capture medical device use data from VistA in near real-time.  VA wants a robust prototype that will demonstrate an automated electronic system able to accurately measure medical device use and allow the performance of intra and inter-facility comparisons. The deliverable system should be able to interface with VA's  VistA and the Clinical Patient Record System (CPRS), a Graphical User Interface, for the following approaches that may be considered:  1) An order set for the placement and removal of medical devices, 2) Natural Language Processing and machine learning methods to extract device use data from clinical, nursing and radiology notes, and 3) Use of Health Factors fields in nursing notes to capture medical device use data to VistA, CareView/Picis, or other data tables. 
Submittal Information
It is requested that interested contractors submit a response (electronic submission) of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.  The Government will not review any other data, attachments that are in excess to the 10 pages.  In response to the RFI, interested contractors shall submit the following information no later than June 11th, 2010 to VA Contracting Officer:  Cheri Wicks (no phone calls accepted and no questions answered at this time).  Email responses only to cheri.wicks@va.gov

Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA FA8773-09-P-0009 . <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete.

Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents.

<DESC>Description - GeneralThe US Fish & Wildlife Service, Willapa National Wildlife Refuge Complex, 3888 SR 101, Ilwaco, WA 98624 has a requirement for Interactive and Interpretive Trail signs  - designed and installed.
SCOPE:Need approximately ten signs to follow along already established trail located at Willapa National Wildlife Refuge near Ilwaco, Washington. Signs will be located along the upper portion of the Willapa Art Trail. Signs must be somewhat directional in nature to keep visitors on the path of the trail and should be interactive and engage the visitor through interpretation of the wildlife and/or ecology of the forested trail. 
Two additional signs are needed to point out the upper trail head, etc. and should be designed to match the interactive ones.
Current signage is temporary in nature but depicts animal tracks common to the area. Visitors are given the opportunity to guess the correct animal by looking at the track and then lifting a cover to see if they are right. Both adults and children enjoy these signs and therefore something interactive and similar in nature is desired. In addition, signs must be biologically accurate, hold up to wet/cold/windy weather conditions, and easily maintained.

<CONTACT>Matthew D. Parlett, Contracting Officer, Phone 6105574237, Fax 6105574224, Email mparlett@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The USDA Forest Service intends to award one firm, fixed price contract for the purchase of a quantity of seven (7) each of Belfort Instruments AEPG1000 Precipitation Gauge and Accessories on a brand name or equal basis. Complete details of the items required can be found in the attached solicitation document AG-3604-S-10-0024. 

This procurement is on a brand name or equal basis. The Forest Service presently supports intensive climate and carbon cycle research at more than a dozen sites where ecological and meteorological measurements are taken from towers extending above the forest canopy.  Infrastructure and research studies at these sites can be augmented in several ways to substantially and quickly increase understanding of climate-carbon interactions.  One way is through upgrading the precision and accuracy of basic long term climate measurements, of which precipitation is one, to the level of NOAAs US Climate Research Network (USCRN).  This upgrade will provide the detailed information to characterize climate change at these sites and will contribute towards identifying climate change across the US.  This will involve close partnership with NOAA.  The precipitation measurement instruments used must match exactly to what is used by the NOAA USCRN.  The Forest Service intends to share data with that network and the Belfort gauges are the latest required precipitation gauges from NOAA.

This requirement is now posted as a joint synopsis/solicitation to www.fbo.gov as of May 5, 2010. Those contractors not downloading the solicitation from this website shall e-mail mparlett@fs.fed.us for a copy. All questions on this requirement are to be in writing and e-mailed to mparlett@fs.fed.us at least 2 days prior to the due date. Proposals will be due on May 14, 2010 no later than 3:00 pm EDT.

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Inductively Coupled Plasma  Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES). ***

Background:  

The Materials and Construction Research Division (MCRD) within the Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) performs research on the chemical and physical properties of infrastructural materials.  Material characterization techniques are needed to determine the elemental composition of aqueous solutions that are in thermodynamic equilibrium with various infrastructural materials.  

The study of infrastructural materials involves a number of complexities:  Corrosion of steel elements within infrastructural materials is a major national problem, so the instrumentation must be capable of detecting halogens.  For some studies, the quantity of solution extraction is very small, so the instrumentation must be able to obtain the entire emission spectrum with relatively few images.  Infrastructural materials are large-volume commodity products having a large number of elements, so optical properties and spectral resolution are important.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.  

Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a Brand Name requirement for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number RFQ0086-10 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and should be referenced on all correspondence.  The RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-41, effective on May 13, 2010.  This solicitation is a 100% total small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541519.  The small business size standard is $25.0 million dollars. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) requires all contractors to be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to receive contract award or payments.  The EEOC intends to make a single award from this solicitation. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: The EEOC has a brand name requirement for RightNow Customer Relations Management (CRM) Software Licenses as follows: CLIN 0001: Eighty (80 ea.) RightNow Enterprise Authorized Users (Part No. ENT-NU): $________; CLIN 0002: One (1 ea.), Web Portal Sessions  20,000 Sessions Per Month (Part No. WP-SES-20K): $_________; CLIN 0003: One (1 ea.), Web Portal (External) Interface (Part No. WPI-LOW): $________; CLIN 0004: Two (2 ea.) RightNow Feedback 500 Surveys Received per Month Block (Part No. MFSC-500):  $________; CLIN 0005: One (1 ea.) Preferred Customer Care Package (Part No. PREF-CCP): $________. TOTAL PRICE TO GOVERNMENT: $_______ (CLIN Nos. 0001 thru 0005) (NOTE: The above eighty (80) software licenses consist of the renewal of seventy (70) current and purchase of ten (10) additional licenses). This software is a Customer Relations Management (CRM) software tool that allows EEOC to more effectively and efficiently answer calls from the public. The EEOC is currently using the software throughout its Intake Information Group (IIG) to access the EEOC information contained in the knowledgebase and manage customer records. When a call comes into an Information Intake Representative (IIR) located at one of  the EEOC fifteen (15) offices that support the IIG, the IIR utilizes customer relations management software to access information about the EEOC and the laws the agency enforce, as well as to enter and track information about callers.  The software is a hosted solution that allows each EEOC IIR to enter the information remotely and management to run reports utilizing the information collected by the IIR. Because EEOC owned the licenses, and the licenses were supported, when EEOC hired 61 Intake Information Representatives (IIRs) in late February 2008 they were trained in the use of the RightNow software. EEOC requires a one year renewal for its current 70 RightNow licenses as well as increasing the overall license count by ten (10).  This will bring the EEOC configuration to a total of 80 RightNow Enterprise licenses.  By having customer relations management software for one year, it will allow for maintenance and upgrade support for the software licenses purchased as well as provide technical support for the agencys current RightNow CRM application.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The anticipated period of performance for the software licenses will be for one year.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  EEOC fifteen (15)  designated offices which support the IIG.  The quoter shall include the following with their quote: Part I: The quoter shall provide a price and description of all CLINs (0001 thru 0005) with the total price. Part II:  The name, title, telephone number, fax number and email address of the point of contact.  Part III:  The nine digit DUNS and Commercial and Government Entity  (CAGE) code with their quote. All contractors who provide goods/services to the EEOC must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR): http://www.ccr.gov. PART IV:  Completed copies of FAR 52.212-3 or an online representations and certification application (ORCA) record must be submitted with the quote. On line Certifications and Representations is available at: http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to comply with the ORCA registration may deem quoter ineligible for award. The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. BASIS OF AWARD:  Award will be made based on best value using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) approach. The evaluation of quotations shall be on GO or No-Go basis and will occur in two sequential stages:  Technical evaluation determines whether quotations are technically acceptable or unacceptable, followed by a price evaluation.  GO: To be technically acceptable, all of the technical requirements as specified in this solicitation are met by the quoter. NO-GO: An unacceptable quote contains one or more deficiencies.  The quote fails to meet specified technical requirements of this RFQ and not all of the technical requirements are met by the quoter. Once the quotes have been determined technically acceptable, award will be based on lowest price.  All responsible small business sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the EEOC.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses are applicable:  FAR Provisions:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items;  FAR Clauses: FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items: 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside; 52.222-3, Convict Labor; 52.222-19, Child Labor-Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies;  52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity;  52,222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons; 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases;  52.232-33, Payment  by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration, 52.233-3, Protest After Award; and  52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim; and FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration are incorporated by reference.

<SUBJECT>National Surveys of Single Parent Caregivers

<DESC>The Office of the Secretary, Office on Womens Health, through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, is seeking sources from all small business to award a contract using simplified acquisition procedures.   This is a 100 percent small business
set-aside.

PURPOSE:
The purpose of this contract is to conduct a national survey of single parent caregivers
based upon recommendations from OWHs commissioned Literature Review on
Existing Supports for Single Parent Caregivers.  

BACKGROUND 
Providing extended and/or short-term care to an aging or sick parent, sibling, child,
a person with a disability, or assisting with the care of a neighbor or friend is a reality
for millions of Americans.  Serving as a caregiver to these individuals can lead to stress,
depression, fatigue, overuse of medications, lack of exercise, lack of time for family
and friends, and underutilization of preventive services.  About 3.7 million Medicare
enrollees received care from a paid or unpaid caregiver in 1999.  Over 60% of caregivers
are women who are married with children of their own and trying to manage two
households.  These women, along with their male counterparts, are referred to as
the Sandwich Generation, and it is estimated that they cost American business
$11-$33 billion dollars a year. Federal agencies and private sector organizations
have facilitated the development of a caregiver support system, identified and
published a compendium of resources, and conducted a survey on the needs
of young caregivers; however, much remains to be done.

The Office on Womens Health is exploring the issues of single parent caregivers as
a potential area of unmet need that might be addressed through future Federal policy
and program activities. A literature review was conducted in 2009 with the
recommendation for further examination of this subpopulation of caregivers
(http://www.womenshealth.gov/owh/pub/SupportsforSingleParentCaregivers.pdf).

The proposed survey will help to further identify this subpopulation of caregivers;
define their demographic, socioeconomic, mental and physical health status and
needs; describe the population they care for; identify their special needs as single
parent caregivers; identify the gaps in services available to them; and identify barriers,
including policies that impede their access to services.  OWH will share information
gleaned from this study with policymakers, Congress, general media and program
staff to inform future initiatives/programs designed to support and assist this unique
population of caregivers.

STATEMENT OF WORK: 
The contractor shall conduct a nationally representative survey of the population of
single parent caregivers and prepare a report documenting their demographic,
socioeconomic, mental and physical health status and needs; describing the
population they care for; identifying their special needs as single parent caregiver;
identifying the gaps in services available to them as well as the barriers, including
policies that impede their access to services.

The Contractor shall work closely with the OWH in all phases of this work. The

(2) History (current or within the last 18 months) of projects similar in scope and nature, with specific references (including project identifier/contract number and description, period of performance, dollar amount, client name and current telephone number). References will be checked to validate the information provided and to determine reliability/dependability. (3) Key personnel (those who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project) with relevant qualifications and specific experience. <br />Cost Proposal: provide Firm Fixed-Price "broken out by labor hours, labor category, materials, and other direct costs".

<p>***</p>
<p>Proposal Evaluation Criteria: Proposals will be evaluated based on two criteria: (1) technical merit and (2) cost/price. Technical evaluations will be based on how the following subfactors are addressed in the proposal:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.(ii) Examples.(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).*********  This field was truncated.

The aviation industry and the U.S. military are continually pushing the envelope of current aircraft technology.  AATD is looking to purchase a system that has very broad capabilities.  We recognize the 32 kHz control frequency requirement exceeds the capability of the slip table and may seem inconsistent with the total system.  However, this laboratory plans to use this added capability to control other force-vibration shakers we currently have and others we plan to acquire in the future.  We also believe this added resolution will allow us better analysis and/or visualization into a given test.  Therefore, we believe this capability is a requirement. <BR><BR>Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and submit a proposal. All responsible sources that submit an offer will be considered. Proposals are due on June 10, 2010, 2:00 PM EST and shall be submitted to the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Attn: CCAM-RDT (Erika Matthews), 401 Lee Blvd., Fort Eustis VA 23604-5577 by email (erika.faith.matthews@us.army.mil) or regular mail.

award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses
(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).

----------------------------------------------------------------

            WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">This Special Notice announces the Government's intention to modify the existing sole source contract FA2550-08-C-8012, <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Obscura, Mission Integration, &amp; Network Support </strong>(OMINS) with the contractor currently performing the effort (Lockheed Martin Information&nbsp;Systems &amp; Global Services to extend the period of performance. The current contract provides support of three separate, but related, areas of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN): Obscura, Mission Integration &amp; Network-Common Data) for the 22d Space Operations Squadron (22 SOPS). </span><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The extended period of performance is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">1&nbsp;July 2010 through 31 December 2010</span> to ensure continuation of critical engineering and technical support for mission and system capabilities integration in to the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) while a follow-on competitive acquisition is in progress.<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />The OMINS effort encompasses a full complement of engineering and technical activities necessary to provide 22 SOPS with SOC-to-AFSCN-to-Satellite mission integration and troubleshooting support for new and existing satellite programs (for both internal and external users), multiple system modifications and upgrades, new and existing remote tracking stations, and operational complexes, as well as technical and management support for AFSCN Obscura and Network-common data.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Mission Integration (MI) provides a wide variety of integration support activities to help bring new satellites, systems, and upgrades on-line for the AFSCN. Some of these activities include evaluating new satellite program requirements for AFSCN compatibility, integration, test and troubleshooting support for new systems and programs, technical consultation for pre-launch, launch and on-orbit problem resolution, and other unique AFSCN-specific complications that cannot be resolved by other organizations.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Obscura support provides for data collection, analysis, and management for Obscura (hard and soft Obscura), Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ), Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs), and determination of Transmit Inhibit Zones (TIZs) for the AFSCN, including the development and operation of an automated obscura analysis capability. Obscura data provides the information required to effectively establish and maintain terrain and building survey data (known as "hard" obscura data) as well as vegetation growth ("soft" obscura) that can interfere with reception and transmission of satellite data. <br /><br />Additionally, obscura data is collected when new antennas are installed or construction is underway for these new assets, or any near-by constructions or activities. Obscura data is also gathered which will identify the optimal location to maximize satellite support activities.&nbsp;Obscura support includes the analysis of raw obscura data&nbsp;and utilizes the Automated Obscura and Analysis Capability (AOAC) tool to establish recommended TIZs for the AFSCN to ensure the safety of personnel from RF exposure. Obscura surveys involve obtaining and recording measured Electromagnetic data, and then analyzing, smoothing, and documenting recommended values to update the AFSCN&nbsp;Remote Tracking Station antennas&nbsp;for implementation of the recommended TIZ values.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><br />Network-Common Data Support manages and distributes data which is vital and common to all AFSCN users. This effort is accomplished through the Network Data Management and Control (NDMC) effort which manages, maintains, and modifies the network-common (NET-C) data stored in a central repository accessed by AFSCN users for the implementation of distinct operational parameters critical to their mission success.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notification for commercial services prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 10, utilizing FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research. <br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.<br /><br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure operations and management support services to support resolution of NBS accounting and budget issues that may negatively impact the NIH NBS funds control implementation on behalf of the National Institutes of Health. <br />Title: NBS Support Services<br />BACKGROUND
<p>More than a decade ago, National Institutes of Health (NIH) was one of the first Federal agencies to consider the use of commercial enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to support Federal financial management. At the time, NIH realized that it needed to retire its then decades-old Core Accounting System (CAS) and the Administrative Database (ADB), for inventory, procurement, property management, travel, human resources and central accounting. In spite of the systems' ability to handle transactions at NIH, the systems were becoming obsolete and had to be replaced.</p>
<p>In 1999, NIH began developing the business case for the Oracle-based system that is now the NIH Business Systems or NBS. After significant planning efforts and securing funding for the project, NBS implementation began, module by module. The system now provides tremendous capability and functionality to serve the needs of its customers in the NIH Office of the Director (OD) and across its 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs).</p>
<p>Although NBS now serves as the system of record for the many transactions produced at NIH each day, vision for the system has yet to be fully achieved. Enhancements to the system, its environment and the financial management practices in use at NIH require renewed efforts to develop the world class management capabilities needed to support the world's leading medical research institution. At present, legacy systems are still in use and must be retired to eliminate redundancies, minimize costs and improve financial management and internal control. Other systems within NIH and at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) have yet to have their financial transaction integrated with NBS. For example, the agency's electronic Research Administration (eRA) Information for Management, Planning, Analysis and Coordination (IMPAC II) system, which processes 55,000 grant funding transactions each year, is operated by the Office of Extramural Research (OER). Failure to integrate financial aspects of this the system with NBS perpetuates weaknesses in financial controls for the nearly $25 billion in grants payments made each year. The addition of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding - nearly $10.5 billion at NIH - has significantly increased the amount of grant funding, the number of grant payments processed and the risk associated with having a grants management system that does not have its financial transactions directly integrated with NBS.</p>
<p>Enhancements to the system, its environment and the financial management practices in use at NIH require renewed efforts to develop the world class management capabilities needed to support the world's leading medical research institution. These enhancements are now planned as a series of projects collectively known as the NIH Healthier Financial Management Initiatives (HFMI).</p>
<p>Recently, several driving factors have converged on the NBS Program, which together call on the NBS Program Office to pragmatically consider a number of major financial management initiatives:</p>
<p>Audit findings have noted that the NIH continues to operate NBS without systemic funds checking enabled. Thus, the NBS Program must implement funds checking to prevent Anti-Deficiency Act violations, comply with emerging OMB and treasury requirements and ensure audit compliance.</p>
<p>Congress has required NIH to institute reprogramming controls at the sub-mechanism level. The 2010 Congressional appropriation defined funds control/funds management requirements for NIH. The language requires funds control at the sub-mechanism level, which is a component of the NBS Account Code Structure (ACS) that is not fully enabled for NIH in that the sub-mechanism values have not been fully created or used consistently in account combinations. NIH is currently in conversation with the Appropriations Committee to set the time line for achieving business process and accounting system reprogramming controls. The efforts in this current project will consider this evolving situation and ensure that decisions in system development advance (or at a minimum do not hinder) NIH's capability to implement Congressionally directed controls.</p>
<p>Under combined resources from the 2009 economic stimulus funding (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) and the annual appropriations provided for NBS activities, NIH determined that enhancing the integration of its independent grant and accounting enterprise systems could address these driving factors and significantly improve enterprise operations and support national goals of greater governmental transparency.</p>
<p>This improvement effort consists of a group of interrelated projects referred to as the NIH Healthier Financial Management Integration (HFMI). HFMI consists of the following projects.</p>
<p>o Funds Control - Implement funds management functionality to achieve Anti-deficiency Act compliance)<br />o MAS Retirement - Retire MAS/CAN Maintenance <br />o Grants Integration - Integrate financial aspects of IMPACII-NBS</p>
<p>o Strategies for implementing the Common Government-wide Accounting Classification (CGAC)<br />o Integrate Payment Management System (PMS) with NBS<br />o Implement Oracle Projects<br />o Integrate Payroll-NBS</p>
<p>The HFMI design, development and implementation was procured under a separate contract and is not part of this requirement. This effort is intended to resolve accounting and budget issues that could hamper the implementation of these initiatives.<br />Specific Tasks</p>
<p>Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide expert Information Technology Professional Services to the NIH Business System (NBS) Project for systems analysis, design, programming, conversion and implementation support. These services relate specifically to the analysis and resolution of existing NBS accounting issues identified in NIH Remedy Help Desk System that could negatively impact NIH ability to institute full systemic funds control to begin FY2011 and/or close/open the books for FY2010/2011. <br /><br />DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>The specific current tasks include assistance on the following:</p>

For Remedy tickets that may negatively impact the full systemic funds control implementation; analyze, develop and implement appropriate accounting resolutions to eliminate or mitigate the accounting deficiencies.</p>
<p>Assessment of the NIH Remedy Help Desk System tickets that are NBS Budget related to determine impacts on full systemic funds control implementation. For Remedy tickets that may negatively impact the full systemic funds control implementation or Oracle Federal Administration budget initialization activities; analyze, develop and implement appropriate resolutions to eliminate or mitigate the budget process identified deficiencies.</p>
<p>Support the analysis, development and implementation of any new activities necessary to support the NBS Annual Close processes and procedures that are related to the implementation of HFMI. This includes participation in the NIH NBS annual close internal and external meetings.</p>
<p>Conduct unit and integration testing of all identified tickets and follow normal NBS CR-MOP migration activities.</p>

<DESC>CLARIFICATION:  
THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  NAICS IS 237990.  SMALL BUSINESS SIZE IS $33.5 MILLION.  A size standard is the largest that a concern can be and still qualify as a small business for Federal Government programs.  For the most part, size standards are the average annual receipts or the average employment of a firm. How to calculate average annual receipts and average employment of a firm can be found in 13 CFR  121.104 and 13 CFR  121.106, respectively.

CHANGE:  
QUOTES WILL BE DUE BY 4:00PM (LOCAL TIME) ON JULY 9, 2010.  

Description:
The project consists of the fabrication and installation of a metal trash rack to be installed over the 72-inch water control gate on the upstream vertical face of the Elkwater Fork Water Supply Dam.  The proposed trash rack will have 9-inch wide openings in front and approximately 7-inch wide openings on the sides.  The approximate dimensions of the trash rack are ten feet wide by twenty feet tall.

The site is located off of US Route 219 between Huttonsville and Valley Head, WV.

<RESPDATE>061110
<CONTACT>Joseph R Daum, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-826-6101, Email Contracting@socom.mil - David M.Tenenbaum, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-826-6968, Email david.tenenbaum@socom.mil
<DESC><p><br />This is a sources sought notice and is not a request for proposal or bid. The intent of this sources sought notice is to determine if there small businesses that are qualified and capable of performing IT Production services at a fair market price for the U.S. Special Operations Command's (USSOCOM's) anticipated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) Production - Tactical Local Area Network (TACLAN) contract. The USSOCOM Special Operations Research, Development, and Acquisition Center (SORDAC) in Tampa, FL, is seeking a Capability Statement from all qualified Small Businesses contractors.</p>
<p>The TACLAN Program provides Special Operational Forces (SOF) operational commanders and forward deployed forces advanced automated data processing and display capabilities to support situational awareness, mission planning and execution, and command and control of forces. TACLAN provides the automation infrastructure and common-user applications to interconnect deployed SOF headquarters, main operating locations, tactical teams and liaison elements. Numerous joint, service, and SOF deployed automation programs/efforts operate on TACLAN to gain connectivity to SOF Information Environment (SIE) networks. TACLAN merges numerous deployed SOF automation efforts into a consolidated infrastructure program consisting of hardware and SOF validated software applications. The TACLAN program includes, but is not limited to,TACLAN Suites, Mission Planning Kits (MPKs) and Field Computing Devices (FCDs). Each TACLAN Suite consists of three easily transportable, multiple integrated networks; 60 general use laptops; 10 intelligence laptops; routers; and ancillary equipment used by SOF Command and Control Nodes, forming a deployed Local Area Network (LAN). MPKs consist of four general use laptops and ancillary equipment used by SOF teams for detailed mission planning support. FCDs are small handheld computing devices used by the most forward deployed SOF teams to automatically interface with the TACLAN suite via tactical communications.</p>
<p>At a summary level, the anticipated scope for the TACLAN Production acquisition includes:</p>
<p>* Production<br />-- Program Planning and Management<br />-- Product Design, Fabrication, Integration<br />-- Systems Engineering and Technical Support<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Market research<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; White papers<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; Analysis, testing, recommendations, and implementation of new technology<br />-- Software Integration<br />-- Test and Evaluation<br />-- Configuration Management<br />-- Information Assurance/Security Accreditation<br />-- Quality Assurance<br />-- Meeting/Conference Support</p>
<p>* Integrated Logistics Support (ILS)<br />-- ILS Plan<br />-- Product Procurement<br />-- Technical and Sustainment Support<br />-- Warranty<br />-- Provisioning and Spares<br />-- Technical Manuals<br />-- Training (New Equipment Training and Sustainment Training)<br />-- Fielding and Total Asset Visibility (TAV) Support; Fielding Plans, Disposal Plans<br />-- Software Licensing/Maintenance</p>
<p>* Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the TACLAN contractor will provide all personnel, facilities, materials, equipment, software and services necessary to perform the tasks outlined above. The TACLAN contractor must possess a Top Secret facility clearance and personnel cleared up to the TS/SCI level.</p>
<p>USSOCOM's current TACLAN Production contract (H92222-08-D-0017) expires<br />31 March 2011. The Government anticipates a single, small business set aside contract for the C4I Production - TACLAN contract. North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is anticipated to be 541519 (Other Computer Related Services), with a small business size standard of 150 employees. If you believe a different NAICS Code is more appropriate please provide the recommended NAICS code and supporting rationale.</p>
<p>All interested Small Businesses with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit a CAPABILITY STATEMENT consisting of appropriate documentation, literature and brochures which should include:</p>
<p>1) Firm's name, address, telephone and fax numbers.<br />2) Identification of the type of Small Businesses (i.e., SDVOSB, WOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), etc.).<br />3) Past experience with IT Production work.

<p>The CAPABILITIES STATEMENT for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather a short statement regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing or developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified herein. Any existing marketing material may also be submitted with the CAPABILITIES STATEMENT.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Responses must be limited to no more than 10 pages (title/cover page and table of contents are not included in the 10 page limit). Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

Questions and Answers


1.	Question: In the above captioned SFO, it is unclear how the % s are to be calculated.  Are all %s to be calculated as a % of Total contract value?  This is implied with the description of the SDB %, but is not clearly stated throughout the factor description.  
 
Answer:  Business Concern                                                                  VA Goal
 
Small Disadvantaged Business (includes Section 8 (a))                 5%
Women-Owned Small Business                                                      5%
Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business                         7%
Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) Zone Small Business 3%
Veteran-Owned Small Business                                                      10%
 
Offerors who do not have an overall target of at least 28.7% for subcontracting with small business concerns may not be competitive for this subfactor.  
 
1 - 2.   GOALS - Please state separate dollar and percentage goals for Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns.  
 
NOTE:    VAS REQUIRED GOALS ARE SHOWN BELOW WITH ASTERISKS.  ZERO PERCENT VALUE FOR GOALS OR N/A ARE UNACCEPTABLE.  GOALS AND PERCENTAGES MUST BE ROUNDED TO THE NEARST DOLLAR AND TENTH OF A PERCENT.  EXAMPLE OF HOW TO CALCULATE THE GOALS:
 
 	DOLLARS	PERCENT
Total Contract Price	$1,500,000	 
Total to be Subcontracted	1,000,000	100
Subcontract to Small Business	  287,000	28.7
Subcontract to Small Disadvantaged Business	    50,000	5.0
Subcontract to Women-Owned Small Business	   50,000	5.0
Subcontract to HUBZone Small Businesses	   30,000	3.0
Subcontract to Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business	   70,000	7.0
Subcontract to Veteran-Owned Small Business	   100,000	10.0
 
 
The minimum requirement for small business subcontracting goal is 28.7%.   The percentage of each category of small business is a total of 30%. The total contract value is $15 million.  
 
 
 
2.	Question:   Is there a deadline for questions or are you responding to any received up to the submission date?

Answer:  We will respond to questions up until June 4, 2010

3.	Question:  I am looking forward to submitting my proposal as a Small Business for the above-referenced solicitation and have one question about subcontracted services.  Since I will be responding under NAICS Code 531210 as a Small Business, do you require any subcontractors that I include in my service offering to be considered Small Businesses as well?

Answer: No. 

4.	Question:  Can the solicitation be saved in word 97-2000 format doc not docx?  In its present condition only individuals with a new "Office" program are capable of opening the file.

Answer: There are no plans to change the format.

5.	Question:  Can VA personnel who are overseeing a current vendors work be asked to submit a recommendation on behalf of an offeror for this Solicitation?

Answer:  No

6.	Question:  We are interested in preparing a proposal for the National Broker IDIQ Contract.  Would you please provide us with the full SFO document at your earliest convenience?  I have some questions about the solicitation based on the posted noticed but I will wait to see if the full SFO document answers them before I take your time with them.  There is one initial qualification I do want to understand right from the start, however.  Although we are a small business, we have several operating arms that include development and property management in addition to the real estate services we would propose to provide under a broker contract.  If we were to be awarded an IDIQ contract for services, would we precluded from making offers to the VA under solicitations that were assigned to other brokers?  
     
Answer:  Yes

7.	Question: In the description of the solicitation in the first complete paragraph near the end it has MIA appraiser versus MAI Appraiser.  MAI is a trade association and other vendors, etc. belong to other trade associations besides MAI and that there have been lawsuits over it.  Why are we using/requesting MAI Appraisers?  Why didnt we set-aside for Service Disabled Vets?

Answer:  VA will use MAI Appraisers that have substantive knowledge of the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Procurements.  VA plans to award contracts to large and small businesses.  VA has included award evaluation criteria for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business in this solicitation.  


8.	Question: Is it considered a conflict of interest if a company were to provide a response to this SFO when they are currently and will possibly continue to do construction work for VA?

Answer:  While Real Property Service is an office under the Office of Construction & Facilities Management, it is separate and apart from the offices that work on construction projects.  It is not a conflict of interest to provide a response to this SFO while continuing to work on VA construction projects
 

9.	Question: Can you provide anticipated lease expiration dates?  Having this information would allow companies to forecast VA activity throughout the nation and give them a picture as to how their resources will need to be allocated for the contract year.

Answer: Real Property Service procures leases for 15 to 20 year terms.  There are leases in the VA system that expire and new leases to be procured every year.

10.	Question:  Can you still apply if you are not a national company?  Are you allowed to partner with other companies?

Answer:  Partnering is a business decision on the part of the offering group.  It is not prohibited.  All interested businesses that can meet the requirements of the solicitation are encouraged to apply.

30.	Question:  Pg. 45 G2.2 vs. Pg. 82 l.40 52.233-3  Please clarify work terminated for the convenience of the Government.  It seems that in some instances VA will pay the contractor for work performed on a cancelled T.O.  and in others it will not.

( Those Offerors who can demonstrate that they performed post-award (after lease execution) services such as monitoring construction of tenant improvements and other such services required by a client for occupancy will be considered more favorably.  The proposal will be evaluated to determine if an Offeror has performed at least 150 annual real estate transactions in at least 30 of the 50 States in both major metropolitan and rural areas within the last three years).

Page 106 states "The estimated contract value based on potential commissions is $20 Million including the base year an all years."  We understand that these two different numbers may be explained by whether landlord commissions are included in the value addition to the fixed hourly prices, but any further clarification by VA would be appreciated.

Answer:  Total value of the contract including options years is 15 Million 

40.	Questions:  In the presolicitation notice, the VA indicated that that it may award this contract to up to 3 small businesses and 3 large businesses.

Would VA evaluate the qualifications of the non-prime firms, if the Offeror included a teaming agreement?  Would the VA evaluate the qualifications of the entire team of firms, if they submitted as a joint venture?

53.	Question:  It is unclear from Section L.6.4 of the RFP as to whether the 6 copies of the Technical Proposal required for submission are all electronic copies or hard copies.  Please confirm the quantity of hard copies of the technical and price proposal for submission from the RFP and the number of electronic copies required as well?

Answer:  All submissions are to be in electronic format.  Six (6) copies of technical proposal and one price proposal.  No hard copies. 

54.	Question:  Exhibit 11 to the RFP provides a very general list of existing VA facilities.  Unfortunately, it does not provide sufficient detail to allow for a determination of potential quantity of work from which to assess resource requirements and revenue potential from this RFP.  Will the VA make available a full list of existing lease locations, include size, term and rental rates, to be included for delivery under the contracts to be awarded from this RFP so that a full assessment of the requirements can be completed?

Answer: Past VA Budgets can be researched to track the history of major projects.  Project listed in the Budgets are not the only projects procured by Real Property Service.

Of the 1,700 leases in the VA system, approximately 150 are Real Property Service procurements

Question: The RFP states VA estimates the total contract value over 5 years will not exceed $15 million. Does this mean VA predicts the aggregate value of all contracts will not exceed $15 million or the aggregate value of each contract will not exceed $15 million?

Answer:  The total value for each contract including all options is 15 million. 

57.	Question:  Section C.5.9.3, appears to not be complete.

Answer:  This section is being rewritten to incorporate post award construction management services.  Standard Post Award services are outlined in C.4.2.12.

Answer:  VA issues task orders for FY10 projects as the users are ready to begin the projects. If any remain after the new contract is awarded, task orders will be awarded to the new group of Contractors.  The projects listed in the FY11 Budget will not be assigned until authorized by Congress and the users are ready to begin.  All of those task orders will be awarded under the new contract.


72.	Question: How many task orders has VA terminated under the existing contract over the last 5 years?

Answer:  Two task orders

73.	Question:  What is VAs average timeframe from approval of lease authorization to award? To occupancy?

Answer:  RPS leases are for 15 to 20 year term.  Those leases with a 15 year term may have a 5 year option to extend but the extensions would be exercised by the Administrative Contracting Officer at the local facility.  Task Orders may include the need to extend a current lease by a year or two in order to provide sufficient time to procure and occupy the new space.  This would be in conjunction with a task order to procure a new lease.

79.	Question:  How many VA leases are currently in holdover status?

Answer:  None at this point.

80.	Question:  What is the annual median number of VA leases extended or expanded with the landlord at lease expiration? 

Answer: There may be as many as five leases requiring short term extensions at lease expiration in order to provide sufficient time to complete the new space.  Leases are never expanded at expiration.

81.	 Question:  What is the median lease firm term of VA leases? 

Answer:  Most Real Property procurements have a 20 year firm term.  Occasionally there will be a 15 year firm term with a 5 year renewal option.

82.	Question:  Section C.5 asserts the VA will not compensate a contractor for assisting VA with disputes which may arise over the term of a VA tenancy. Assuming the majority of VA leases are for at least a 10 year term, how does VA propose to limit the contractor to unforeseen and therefore unpredictable time and expenses associated with VAs contract dispute resolution needs and statutory and regulatory requirements?

Answer:  Assisting VA with disputes and regulatory requirements is within the scope of the task order.

83.	Question:  In light of OCFMs current plan to deliver design and construction services on a regional basis, does OCFM plan on pushing out lease management services to its regional delivery hubs over the term of this contract? 

Answer:  Once a building is accepted for occupancy, lease management is delegated to an Administrative Contracting Officer at the local level.  This will not change.  There will be regionalization of the current procurement staff, but the details are not yet developed

103.	Section L.7, Factor 3, Page 103  Are there any page limitations related to Subfactor 3(a) or Subfactor 3(b)?

Answer:  There are no stated page limitations for Subfactors 3(a) and 3 (b).

104.	Section L.7, Subfactor 3(b), Page 103  When preparing a Small Business Plan, what should offerors  assume for the total contract value?
a) Should large businesses assume that their total contract value will be up to $15 million?
b) Or is $15 million the value of all the contracts awarded under this IDIQ?
c) If the latter, how many contractors should we assume will be awarded an IDIQ contract for the purposes of dividing this total amount over five years?

Answer:  Each awarded contract has a maximum total value of $15 Million.



105.	Question:  Section L.7, Subfactors 3(a) and 3(b), Page 103  Can VA please clarify the conflicting requirements included these two sections as well as the requirements included on Page 116 in Section M.3: Page 103 (3(a)): The Government believes there are significant subcontracting opportunities
under the contract. While a minimum requirement is not established for subcontracting, large business concerns that propose less than 28.7% of the total contract value for subcontracting opportunities, may not be competitive.
Page 103 (3(b)): There is no minimum requirement for SDB subcontracting; however, targets of less than 5% of the total contract value may not be competitive. For large business concerns, the targeted amount for SDBs is counted in the overall 28.7% goal under Subfactor (a).
Page 116: All proposals, including those from small business concerns, will be evaluated for their commitment to subcontract with Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns. The targeted amount of the total contract value for small disadvantaged business will be evaluated against the Governments goal of at least five percent. This is a goal, not a mandatory requirement.
However, a goal of less than five percent may not be competitive. Dollar target and types of services, including the complexity and variety of the work to be subcontracted, will be evaluated.  Generally, on IDIQ contracts where there is a set aside for small businesses, the subcontracting goals for Large Business are calculated as a percentage of total subcontracted dollars, rather than total contracted dollars.  a) Can the VA please confirm that large businesses should set a goal of subcontracting at least five percent of total contract dollars to small businesses?
b) Consistent with the 9.a) above, can the VA please confirm that large businesses should subcontract at least 28.7 percent of all subcontracted dollars to small businesses, according to the goals set on page 116 for each type of small business?

Answer:  Answered in Question1.
 
106.	Question:  Section L.7, Factor 4, Page 104  Can VA please confirm what information should be provided to address the requirements of Factor 4 that has not already been included under Factor 3?

Answer:  A statement is all that is required for Factor 5.

107.	Question:  Section M.1, Page 112  Can VA please confirm/identify the mandatory minimum requirements that offerors must meet to qualify to participation on this contract?

Answer:  The minimum requirements are set forth in Section H 1 of the solicitation.

108.	Question: Section M.1, Page 112  Can VA provide the weighting for each evaluation criteria?

Answer: Technical factors and subfactors are listed in decending order of importance.  Weights will not be provided to the bidders.

109.	Question:  Section M.3, Subfactor 1(c), Page 113  The fourth paragraph references Key personnel being available during normal business hours. Was this meant to be all Personnel to include proposed Leasing Personnel and Consultants as well?

Answer:  Yes.  Key personnel would include those people actively working on a Task Order, regardless of whether they are consultants or employees.

110.	Question:  Section M.3, Subfactor 2(a), Page 115  Can VA please explain the reference included just above Subfactor 2(b) to meeting the standards of Subfactors 2(a) through 2(d). It appears that this section only includes Subfactor 2(a) and 2(b). This same reference appears in Section L.7, Subfactor 2,Experience/Past Performance and Subfactor 2(a) on Page 102.

Answer:  This should read Subfactors 2 (a) and 2 (b).

111.	Question: H. Exhibits,  Exhibit 3C, Page. 135, Line 3 - DUAL AGENCY DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. Identification of the Property Involved to all other interested parties would appear to violate Procurement regulations that prohibit divulging acquisition information about participation to other potential Offerors. Please clarify the VAs intent for the blank to be filled in by Contractors in the form.

Answer:  Exhibits are included as reference points.  They are not intended to be completed as part of this procurement.


112.	Question:  Exhibit 11, Page 164 - No locations are identified for VISN 13 and 14 in Exhibit 11 and the VISN count in the Exhibit numbers 23. Section F.1. of the RFP states that there are 21 VISNs. Does the numbering in Ex 11 contain a typographical numbering error or are certain numbers (i.e. 13 and 14) not used?

Answer:  VA is divided into 21 VISNs.  VISNS 13 and 14 were combined to create VISN 23.

<DESC>DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS
<p>Recovery Act-Funded Contract Action</p>
<p>Identification of OPDIV/Contracting Activity: OAGM/AGG/DRCG</p>
<p>Title: CMS Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) Public Use Data Pilot Project<br />Contract Type: Cost Plus Fixed-Fee<br />Contractors: XRAD Task Order Contractors<br />Period of Performance: Two (2) Years from Date of Award</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR): Chris Haffer, ORDI</p>
<p>Findings:<br />I. Authority</p>
<p>This contract is funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, (Recovery Act, P.L. 111-5) which specifies, "To the maximum extent practicable, contracts funded under this Act shall be awarded as fixed-price contracts through the use of competitive procedures." <br />II. This contract action is competitive.<br />__X__ Yes<br />_____ Not Available for Competition. This action is statutorily exempt from competition, e.g., noncompetitive 8(a) set-aside, Tribal agreements (for IHS only), mandatory source.<br />_____ No As appropriate, please attach a copy of (1) the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC); (2) the Limited Source Justification (LSJ); (3) documentation of Exception to the Fair Opportunity Process (under FAR 16.505(b)(5)); or (4) for simplified acquisitions, a brief description of the circumstances which justify not competing, signed by the contracting officer. <br />III. This contract action is fixed price. <br />_____ Yes<br />___X_ No</p>
<p>Specificity/nature of requirement (risk and profit):</p>
<p>Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) is designed to compare different interventions to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor health conditions. These interventions may include medications, procedures, medical and assistive devices and technologies, behavioral change strategies, delivery system interventions, and the like. This information can be used to develop practice guidelines and other methods to promote informed health care decision-making. Armed with this information, health care providers and beneficiaries can select treatments that are most likely to lead to improved health and functioning. As providers and patients are able to focus on treatments that are more effective, we also expect to see program savings over time. <br />As a by-product of administering the Medicare program, CMS maintains one of the most comprehensive administrative data resources anywhere to support such applications. We have claims data for all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries (about 80% of the Medicare population) for different settings and types of care, including: inpatient and outpatient hospital, skilled nursing facilities, home health, hospice, physicians/suppliers, durable medical equipment, and prescription drugs. To date, researchers need to pay CMS a recovery-of-cost fee to generate files from the data repository. For many researchers this fee represents a significant barrier to being able to obtain the data needed to conduct CER. <br />The purpose of this project is to increase access to CMS claims data through the creation of public use data and to determine a method of providing public access to these data which is useful to researchers and data entrepreneurs, while continuing to strictly protect beneficiary and provider confidentiality. <br />This activity is being conducted for the first time. These requirements are being developed and implemented de novo. There is no precedent or prior work on which to model this activity. This is technically and scientifically complex activity which will require an unknown number of iterations of the activity to ensure the production of high value data, in a rapid manner, while adhering to the highest level of beneficiary and provider protection.<br />Monitoring and Cost Control<br />CMS has always utilized a significant degree of cost control over contracts that are not conducive to fixed pricing arrangements. This has been possible because of the vast knowledge and experience within the Office of Research Demonstrations and Information regarding Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP research programs. In addition, OAGM proposes to compete this acquisition utilizing the XRAD (6 small business contractors) Task Order Contracts. This acquisition approach combines the knowledge and experience of CMS' technical program acumen and the vast experience of our contractor community with CMS programs and goals. This partnering relationship permits the most efficient use of CMS funds, promotes efficiencies and costs savings, and quickly facilitates the identification and resolution of problems. Although the above considerations are positive the very nature of research projects has demonstrated that projected results at the start of a project are subject to varying circumstances, most notably the enactment of new legislation and/or regulations that may govern the nature of the final requirement. In addition to the above concerns with determining a sound basis for developing a scope of work that would be conducive to fixed price contracting environment, the following price and technical issues also adversely affect that process.<br />Price<br />Although a fixed price contract is desirable in that the contractor assumes the risk for performance, the CMS must consider the potential financial and performance risk to the contractor under these highly visible ARRA programs.<br />A firm-fixed price contract is suitable when reasonable definitive functional or detailed specifications exist, and the contracting officer can establish fair and reasonable prices based on the following considerations:<br />&bull; there is adequate price competition<br />&bull; there are reasonable price comparisons under prior purchases of the same or similar services on a competitive basis supported by valid pricing data<br />&bull; available pricing information permits realistic estimates of probable cost of, and<br />&bull; performance uncertainties can be identified and reasonable estimates of their cost impact can be made.</p>
<p>As stated above, this activity is being competed for the first time. Therefore, there are no prior competitive actions to support the establishment of fair and reasonable pricing data.</p>
<p>IV. If this contract action is not both fixed price and competitive, describe any additional steps taken to pursue a fixed priced competitive award (e.g., prepared more precise requirements documents; established more stringent review thresholds; expanded market research). No additional steps were taken to pursue a fixed price award.</p>
<p>V. Determination:<br />Based upon the findings, it is the determination of the government that a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee award enhances the degree of potential successful performance and promotes the potential of competition from the XRAD contractors that could not absorb the risk of a fixed-price award.<br />The HCA (or a GS-1102-15 or higher designee) certifies that a fixed price award is not appropriate (considering contract risk, profit, and specificity/nature of requirement).</p>

<AWARDEE>Humanitas, Inc., 1100 Wayne Avenue, Suite 650, Silver Spring, MD 20910 US
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded a Cost Reimbursement Task Order to Humanitas, Inc., under the IDIQ Contract No. HHSH250200976001I, in the amount of $150,376.35. The period of performance is for three and one half (3.5) months from the effective date of award.
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain services to plan, direct and execute a Field Objective Review entitled "(BHPr) Equipment to Enhance Training for Health Professionals (EETHP) - Nurse Education Practice and Rentention" These services include pre-review, review, and post review functions as well as close-out activities.</p>
<p>The Original IDIQ contract was competitively solicited as a 100% small business set-aside under FBO and was competitively awarded.</p>
<p>This procurement was awarded as a Cost Plus Award Fee type of Contract because the program office could not be sure of the actual number of grant applications that it would receive by the grant opportunity due date. Therefore, a firm commitment could not be made. It would not be possible to accurately estimate these costs with a reasonable degree of confidence given this unknown factor (actual number of grant applications), which also affects the number of panels that will be required to review the grants applications.</p>
<p>A Cost Plus Award Fee type of contract is appropriate for the required services and allows the Government to only pay for the review of the actual number of grant applications received and at the same time, provide the flexibility to have the appropriate number of panels.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) OF 2009.</p>

As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>The purpose of the proposed work is to further develop MBTs that are useful to assess biodegradation potential and activity at contaminated field sites and this goal will be pursued in the context of perchlorate.  Aligned with this purpose, the project has two main objectives.  The first objective is to refine quantitive assays that target functional genes related to perchlorate reduction.  The second is to improve the Prokaryotic cDNA Subtraction protocol, to increase the likelihood of identifying biodegradation genes in novel environmental bacteria.  The protocol will be applied to a perchlorate-reducing bacterium to expand the database of functional gene sequences ralated to perchlorate reduction.

<DESC>The purpose of the proposed work is to further develop MBTs that are useful to assess biodegradation potential and activity at contaminated field sites and this goal will be pursued in the context of perchlorate.  Aligned with this purpose, the project has two main objectives.  The first objective is to refine quantitative assays that target functional genes related to perchlorated reduction.  The second objective is to improve the Prokaryotic cDNA Subtraction protocol, to increase the likelihood of identifying biodegradation genes in novel environmental bacteria.  The protocol will be applied to a perchlorate-reducing bacterium to expand the database of functional gene sequences related to perchlorate reduction.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a contract using the authority under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  The United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) intends to award a sole source contract to POWER Engineers, Inc. to provide an update to the Haiti Generation, Transmission and Distribution Projects Technical Assistance (TA) Report completed under a USTDA-funded grant in 2007.  POWER Engineers, Inc. was the contractor who conducted the original TA completed in 2007.  This contracting action will provide a clear picture of the current electricity situation in Haiti following the devastating earthquake earlier this year, and will identify and prioritize short-term repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction and upgrade investments in the electricity sector for government and private sector entities in Haiti.  The official government estimate of the requirement is $250,000.  The period of performance is not anticipated to exceed 12 months.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Questions should be directed to Jason Bell e-mail jbell@ustda.gov and Phone Number 703-875-4357. A justification is attached.  This contract action is contingent upon the completion by USTDA of special Congressional notification requirements specified by law.
