The goal for  2018/2019 is to carry out the analysis for 30 donors spanning the age-range from 20-80 years. Cytapheresis samples will be fractionated by a combination of magnetic bead purification and flow cytometry into 10 cell subsets. RNA isolated from each cell subset and total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be sequenced to identify age-associated changes and develop algorithms to de-convolute data from PBMC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChlP) and DNase I hypersensitivity analysis will be carried out using antibodies directed against specific histone modifications and ATAC protocol, respectively.  For these studies we will use only PBMC samples and the most abundant cell subsets to start with.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award as a sole source requirement for the purchase and installation of telematics devices and peripheral equipment, to Syntech Systems Inc. This proposed contract action is for supplies and/or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The US Customs and Border Protection has a requirement for the purchase and installation of telematics devices and related equipment for a portion of its vehicle fleet. This action is a logical follow-on to the previously awarded Fuel Management Initiative Program competitively awarded IDIQ contract, whereby an initial phase of telematics devices were purchased for various fleet vehicles. Those devices were specifically designed to be compatible with the operational capabilities of the fuel management hardware and software system (FMLive), as installed by that project. The new telematics devices must be compatible with the previously installed fuel management system. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any vendors who believe they can provide the services and can provide proof of ability to meet the requirements should email their company's capabilities information to the attention of Frank S. Duarte, Contracting Officer (CO), at frank.s.duarte@dhs.gov, by August 10, 2017. Information submitted should support the company's capability to perform the work required. The Government shall not be responsible for costs in the preparation of responses to this announcement. Only email responses accepted. No phone calls.

<DESC>NOAA's NMFS, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Auke Bay Laboratories, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), to CLS America, Inc.  CLS America, Inc. is a satellite service provider for the ARGOS satellite-based system. The Argos system collects data from platform terminal transmitters (pop-off satellite tags) and distributes this sensor and location data to the tag user/owner. Data is retrieved from the tag once it has released from the fish and reached the surface and provided to the tag owner as long as the tag battery is functioning and the tag has not been "turned off." Pop-off tag data is directly retrieved from CLS America, Inc. via daily emails and from the tag manufacturer once it has been received and run through a quality control procedure. The tags are programmed to communicate with the ARGOS system satellites only, as specified by the manufacturers. Tags used in this study are programmed to remain on the fish for two years, and full data set retrieval is expected to take approximately 6 months maximum. Tags will be released on fish during the summer 2018. Therefore, expected period of performance is expected to extend through February 2020.
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service conducts research on the distribution and migration of spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) in the Gulf of Alaska. Tagging studies have been ongoing for both species and may continue into the future. During the summer of 2018 up to 34 pop-off satellite archival tags (PSAT) made by Microwave Telemetry, Desert Star or Wildlife Computers will be deployed on either spiny dogfish or sablefish. These projects have potential for future tag deployments in 2019 and 2020, thus this contract is written with options through 2024. The tags are programmed to pop-off up to 2 years following deployment and then transmit all collected data to orbiting ARGOS satellites. Complete data transmissions can take up to a maximum of 6 months. The tags collect data on tilt, acceleration, temperature, depth, light level, magnetic field strength of the environments in which the fish inhabits. This contract will support the services necessary to acquire the data from orbiting satellites, process the raw data into user applicable formats, and determine the geographic positions of the tags.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC TASKS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall receive technical guidance from the onsite COTR or ACOTR in order to meet established objectives listed above and provide the following services or deliverables:</p>
<p>A.	Base Service: Satellite data upload, download and preliminary data processing.<br />a.	Upload data from up to 34 Microwave Telemetry (model X-tags), Wildlife Computers (mini-PAT) or Desert Star (model ST-PSAT) to orbiting ARGOS satellites when tags attempt transmission. Data transmissions will occur between August 2018 and February 2021, or up to 2.5 year from the individual tag's release date.<br />b.	Download and process recovered data, includes formatting data into text files and estimating geographic positions recovered data from orbiting satellites.<br />c.	Provide electronic access via e-mail or website to data from up to 34 PSAT tags.<br />B.	Option 1: Same as above with estimated start and end dates of August 2019-February 2022 for up to 50 total tags.<br />C.	Option 2: Same as #1 with estimated start and end dates of August 2020-February 2023 for up to 50 more tags.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation, but a notice of our intent to award to a single source.  Any and all questions can be email to heather.mahle@noaa.gov with subject ABL-18093.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<p>1.	Introduction and Background</p>
<p>MCC's mission is to provide grant assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in select developing countries with a demonstrated commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC's partner countries enter into a five-year agreement (Compact) with MCC that includes a plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives. Our model is defined by core principles, of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results.</p>
<p>Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. Our Values are CLEAR: Embrace Collaboration, Always Learn, Practice Excellence, Be Accountable and Respect individuals and ideas. MCC's values define how we behave on a daily basis, both as individuals and as an institution, in pursuit of our mission. They guide how we make decisions, set priorities, address challenges, manage tradeoffs, recruit and develop staff, and work together with our country partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Whether you are new to the Federal Government or an experienced professional seeking a career change, visit our Website at https://www.mcc.gov to see the kinds of dynamic projects our staff is undertaking MCC's mission is to reduce poverty through economic growth.</p>
<p>2.	Scope of Position</p>
<p>Our model is defined by principles of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results. Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. MCC's values are CLEAR - Collaboration, Learning, Excellence, Accountability and Respect. We recruit staff that will embody and uphold these values.</p>
<p>This position is located in the Department of Compact Operations (DCO), Millennium Challenge Corporation. The Division of Infrastructure, Environment, and Private Sector is responsible for the development and oversight of MCC's infrastructure investments (which account for two-thirds of the agency's portfolio), private sector development programs and partnerships, and the environmental and social performance of all MCC projects. The position will be within the Environmental and Social Performance (ESP) practice group.</p>
<p>The PSC will report to and be supervised by the Practice Lead and Senior Director (PLSD) for ESP.</p>
<p>This position is not authorized to supervise any Federal employees.</p>
<p>3.	Personal Services Contract</p>
<p>MCC is authorized to enter into a contract with an individual as a Personal Services Contractor (PSCs) under the authority of Section 614(a) (8) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003.</p>
<p>A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSCs is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSCs is subject to most of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The following elements apply to this contract:<br />(1)	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />(2)	Principal tools and equipment may be furnished by the Government.<br />(3)	Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission.<br />(4)	Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel.<br />(5)	The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year.<br />(6)	The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to-<br />(i)	Adequately protect the Government's interest;<br />(ii)	Retain control of the function involved; or<br />(iii)	Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee.</p>
<p>4.	Key Requirements</p>
<p>Awardee must satisfy the following key requirements:<br />&bull;	U.S. citizenship or legal, permanent resident with at least 2 years of residency history, preferably 3 years.<br />&bull;	Must be able to obtain and maintain a federal security clearance.<br />&bull;	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />&bull;	Domestic and international travel will be required.<br />&bull;	Statement of Employment &amp; Financial Interest (e.g., Office of Government Ethics "OGE Form-450" or similar statement) may be required.<br />&bull;	Active System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) registration (this is a free, Government website) and be listed as sole-proprietor.<br />&bull;	Designated and/or random drug testing required.</p>
<p>5.	Duties</p>
<p>a)	Major Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>1.	Collaborate with MCC staff and Compact country counterparts to help promote sound environmental and social performance of Compact activities and ensure compliance with MCC's environmental and social standards and guidelines.</p>
<p>2.	Provide technical and administrative support on the evaluation and management of environmental and social risks and performance of Compact-funded activities and help to identify opportunities for enhancing project design and implementation.</p>
<p>3.	Engage on key Compact development and implementation activities to help ensure that MCC-funded activities comply with host country laws and regulations, the MCC Environmental Guidelines and the International Finance Corporation's Social and Environmental Performance Standards.</p>
<p>4.	Review project-related documents (concept papers, feasibility studies, environmental and social assessments and management plans, consultant terms of reference, construction bidding documents, work plans, resettlement action plans and performance monitoring plans) to ensure environmental and social considerations are properly taken into account in the design, feasibility, implementation, timing, and budgets for Compact activities.</p>
<p>5.	Undertake occasional site visits to Compact countries in support of project development and implementation oversight to ensure sound environmental and social performance.</p>
<p>6.	Prepare and/or review terms of reference, budgets, timelines and cost estimates for international and domestic procurements services, and assist with the management of contractors, consultants, and inter-agency agreements.</p>
<p>7.	Support the development and completion of ESP Practice priorities.</p>
<p>8.	Other duties as assigned.</p>
<p>b)	Travel</p>
<p>MCC estimates that the incumbent will be required to undertake 4-6 international trips annually.</p>
<p>c)	Supervisory Controls</p>
<p>As a recognized authority in the development and implementation of ESP programs and operations, the employee is subject only to administrative and policy direction concerning overall project priorities and objectives. The employee is typically delegated complete responsibility and authority to plan, schedule, and carry out major projects concerned with the analysis and evaluation of programs or organizational effectiveness. Analyses, evaluations, and recommendations developed by the employee are normally reviewed by management officials only for potential influence on broad agency policy objectives and program goals. Findings and recommendations are normally accepted without significant change.</p>
<p>d)	Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of general administrative policies, and program, management and organizational theories which require considerable adaptation and/or interpretation for application to issues and problems studied. Policies and precedent studies provide a basic outline of results desired, but do not go into detail as to the methods used to accomplish the project. Within the context of broad regulatory and procedural guidelines, the employee refines or develops more specific guidelines, such as implementing new or revised processes, methods and procedures.</p>
<p>e)	Complexity</p>
<p>The employee plans, organizes, and completes analytical studies involving substantial aspects of key agency programs. As study coordinator, the employee assigns segments of the studies to various participants who are subject-matter specialists in fields appropriate to the study, coordinates the efforts of the group, and consolidates findings into a completed project. There is extreme complexity and difficulty in identifying the nature of the issues or problems to be studied and in planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of the studies. The nature and scope of the issues are largely undefined. Difficulty is also encountered in separating the substantive nature of the programs or issues into their administrative, technical, political, economic, fiscal, and other components, determining the nature and magnitude of the interactions, discerning the intent of legislation and broad agency policies, and determining how to translate the intent into recommended program actions. The work involves efforts to develop and implement programs based upon new or revised legislation requiring consideration of the immediate sequential, and long-range effects, both direct and indirect, of proposed actins on the public, other government programs, and/or private industry.</p>
<p>f)	Scope and Effect</p>
<p>The purpose of the work is to perform very broad and extensive studies related to MCC programs which are of significant interest to the public, Congress, and MCC Compact country governments. Studies frequently involve extensive problems of coordination in fact-finding and in reviewing and evaluating recommendations in interested agencies or with outside groups. Recommendations involve highly significant programs or policy matters, and result in substantial redirection of federal efforts or policy related to major national issues. Results of work are critical to the mission of the agency or affect large numbers of people on a long-term, continuing basis.</p>
<p>g)	Personal Contacts/Purpose of Contacts</p>
<p>Personal contacts are with high-ranking officials from outside the agency at national or international levels in highly unstructured settings. Examples include other agency heads, top congressional staff officials, or executives of comparable private sector organizations.</p>
<p>Personal contacts include individuals and groups at all levels of the Corporation, representatives from other Federal agencies/organizations, MCAs, contractors, and the general public. The purpose of contacts is to influence, motivate, persuade or negotiate with others who may hold different points of views in order to influence managers or other officials to accept recommendations or to obtain the desired effect.</p>
<p>h)	Physical Demands</p>
<p>The work is primarily sedentary, although some walking, bending, or carrying of light items may be involved. Travel may be required.</p>
<p>i)	Work Environment</p>
<p>Work is performed in an office setting, although there is an expectation of work in the field.</p>
<p>6.	Deliverables</p>
<p>Deliverables are associated with the tasks identified in Section 5. Duties to include reports as required by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).</p>
<p>The PSC will provide a monthly progress report as a regular deliverable. Monthly progress reports will consist of the following format to measure the progress of each task:<br />Task: XXXXXX<br />Status: XXXXXXXX<br />Recommendations: XXXXXXX</p>
<p>Monthly reports are due the first workday of each month. The PSC also will produce other reports and analyses as requested by MCC.</p>
<p>Deliverables will be considered "draft" upon initial receipt. Drafts will be reviewed and accepted or concerns raised/comments provided within two weeks of receipt. The PSC shall appropriately address MCC's concerns and provide final deliverables within one week of receiving the MCC response.</p>
<p>The PSCs will submit biweekly timesheets on a schedule and format determined by MCC. Timesheets will include a list of hours worked per compact or country program, along with a brief description of the tasks undertaken for each program during the pay period.</p>
<p>The PSCs also will produce other reports and analyses as requested by MCC.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NICHD201800061  and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-98. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541380 and the business size standard is 1000 employees. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intend to contract on a sole source basis with UW Medicine Department of Pathology, 850 Republican Street Seattle, WA 98109, for Morphometric measurement services.
<p>The NIDDK is seeking services to perform estimates of subpodocyte space (SPS) using serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) in tissue samples from research kidney biopsies in 13 Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes. SPS is a recently described glomerular structure which theoretically can induce up to 2.5-fold resistance against glomerular filtration.  Hence, changes in SPS parameters are crucial in regulating single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) and GFR. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is associated with a wide range of changes in GFR that are thought to be partly responsible for the development and progression of the disease. Very few studies have been performed to measure SPS and none have been performed in DKD. One major obstacle is that currently SPS studies requires three-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy, which is time consuming and expensive. The procedure is highly technically demanding, and requires very expensive specialized electron microscopes that are available in few labs in the U.S.  Moreover, there are virtually no well-defined methodologies for quantification of the geometrical properties of SPS. Based on this unmet need, Dr. Behzad Najafian recently received an award from the Diabetes Complications Consortium (DiaComp) to do pilot studies for 3D modeling of SPS on biopsies from normal human and diabetic tissues (provided by our lab). Dr. Najafian has access to a Zeiss 3View-SEM machine at the University of Washington for doing these studies. In conjunction with these pilot studies he is developing much more time-efficient unbiased morphometric approaches to estimate key geometrical properties of SPS (such as volume, inflow surface area, and outflow surface area) that are directly related to flow resistance, on 2D images obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These approaches will be transformative in facilitating quantitative studies of SPS in various kidney diseases, including DKD. However, the complexity of the SPS shape requires validation and optimization of these morphometric methods.  Furthermore, the DiaComp award only supports the initial pilot studies and does not support these critical validation and optimization process. Therefore, we are asking Dr. Najafian to perform these validation and optimization studies of unbiased morphometric approaches for estimation of the geometrical properties of the subpodocyte space through correlative studies of TEM and SBFSEM on tissue from kidney biopsies obtained from Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Tasks to be performed<br />Estimation of % surface of peripheral and mesangial glomerular basement membrane (GBM) 	that cover the bases of SPS, interpodocyte space (IPS) and peripheral urinary space (PUS) 	using a line intercept method.</p>
<p>Estimation of slit filtration length density at bases of SPS, IPS and PUS and from there calculation of the in-flow surface area of SPS, IPS and PUS.<br />Estimation of volume fraction of SPS, IPS and PUS using point counting method.<br />Characterization of SPS exit pores to IPS and PUS and development of methods to estimate the surface area of these exit pores (SPS outflow surface area).</p>
<p>Correlation between paired TEM and SBFSEM data.</p>
<p><br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition.

<DESC><strong><em>***See attachments for the complete detail.***</em></strong>
<div><strong><em><br /></em></strong>
<div>RFP AMENDMENT 1</div>
<p>The purpose of Amendment 1 is to answer questions related to this RFP and to make appropriate changes to the Terms of Reference (TOR) as well as to this Request for Proposals (RFP). All changes in the TOR are marked by blue font with black horizontal line on the left margin (as Track Changes in Word normally do). All changes in the RFP are highlighted in yellow.</p>
<p>Interested offerors must acknowledge the Amendment 1 in the proposal.</p>
<p>1.	Q: Can non-US companies submit proposals?</p>
<p>A: Yes. To maximize competition, this requirement is full and open to all interested offerors.</p>
<p>2.	Q: Does the offeror have to be registered in SAM before RFP closes?</p>
<p>A: GSA has experience significant backlog in approving SAM registrations and re-registrations. In order to ensure timely award, MCC may decide to reject those firms not registered in SAM by the close of the RFP. Offerors are strongly encouraged to ensure that they are registered before the RFP closes.</p>
<p>3.	Q: Please clarify Place of Performance and the necessary facilities to be provided by the A&amp;E. RFP Page 9 of 40, Section F.2 Place of Performance states: The Contractor shall perform services at their own offices, including in the US and in Abidjan, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire. MCC will not provide Government-furnished property to accomplish this work. This includes during all domestic and international travel. The Contractor shall be responsible for arranging temporary office space as would be required for work not taking place through site visits or meetings with project stakeholders.</p>
<p>However, page 63 of 84 of the TOR, Section 4.10 Performance Location states: The A&amp;E shall perform the tasks under this contract in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. The A&amp;E shall have a complete design office suitable to perform the scope of work including administrative staff in Abidjan, unless otherwise notified and negotiated. All personnel performing work on the project (minus home office admin support) shall be based in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire during the period of performance as outlined in the A&amp;Es workplan and organization. Any exceptions shall be provided in written format to MCC and MCA-CI for approval. Exceptions will be rare, if provided at all.</p>
<p>A: Per Section 4.10 Performance Location of the TOR, all personnel (minus the home office admin support) shall be based in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.</p>
<p>4.	Q: Is there a minimum percentage of work that the prime firm must perform?</p>
<p>A: No.</p>
<p>5.	Q: Please confirm whether the PM/Team Leader must be a full-time employee of the prime firm or if it is acceptable for this individual to be a contract employee (not part or full-time).</p>
<p>A: The Project Manager/Team Lead (PM/TL) does not have to be a full-time employee of the prime firm. MCC will require a signed commitment letter from the proposed PM/TL. MCC may request signed commitment letters of any other proposed individual(s) before the contract award. During contract period, any request to change the Project Manager/Team Lead (PM/TL) must first be agreed and approved by MCC in a formal modification.</p>
<p>6.	Q: Under Abidjan Transport Project Working Committee (ATPWC) in the RFP, Mandate I is to manage and coordinate general traffic in Abidjan including all donor projects and governmental projects related to public works during Compact Period.</p>
<p>Please confirm that this is a separate task/function that MCC is expected to be performed by the A&amp;E consultant under this contract.</p>
<p>In plain words, if we win this contract, we would be required to set up the ATPWC and then manage and coordinate general traffic in Abidjan taking into account existing construction projects already on site or planned to go live, in parallel with the ATP design activities being done.</p>
<p>A: The ATPWC, whose name has been modified to the CTCTC, will be established by an Executive Inter-Ministerial Decision (Arrete interministeriel), which is currently being finalized.  Please refer to the ToR Section 3.2 C.3, (c) Traffic Management during Construction, which has also been modified for clarity.</p>
<p>7.	Q: Under 2.2 Base Period, first bullet point, the RFP states "identify future transport demand on the road network for various development scenarios".</p>
<p>Linked to the previous statement, under 3.2 A) point 2, the RFP refers to "various present and projected donor development scenarios".</p>
<p>Under C.3) Modelling a) Current and Future Traffic the RFP mentions "The future demand shall include at least two urban development scenarios".</p>
<p>Under C.3) Modelling b) Transportation infrastructures the RFP refers to with/without scenarios for 3 possible situations - improvements on principle roads; the metro and new transit projects currently under consideration and/or construction within the next five to ten years; and the second new Pont de P&ecirc;cheurs and access roads connecting the Port to the Blvd de Marseille.</p>
<p>It is not clear from the above what scenarios you are most interested in. Could you therefore please confirm how many scenarios do we need to allow for in the transport modelling, including how many future years?</p>
<p>A: At least three scenarios shall be provided by the A&amp;E.</p>
<p>8.	Q: What transport modelling does currently exist? Reference in the RFP to Transport modelling for the Metro Project; Counts and Simulations by WSP/ Parsons Brinckerhoff; and carrying out a peer-review of modelling work conducted in recent studies.</p>
<p>A: The BNETD has performed some modelling with initial work funded by JICA. It is up to the A&amp;E to analyze and make a determination of the value of the work performed for potential adoption. Work performed by the BNETD will be made available to the A&amp;E as part of a MCA-BNETD funding agreement at no cost to the A&amp;E to obtain the information. All documentation available at GoCI including at the Ministry of Transport for the Metro will be made available to the A&amp;E as part of multiple MCA agreements with all GoCI stakeholder agencies. The Terrabo Origin Destination study and the WSP / Parsons Brinckerhoff traffic counts will also be shared.</p>
<p>9.	Q: Does any of these transport models cover the same model area as for this study?</p>
<p>A: Yes, but it is the A&amp;E entire responsibility to analyze and decide whether the data and models are reliable for use.</p>
<p>10.	Q: In what suite / software are these models? Reference in the RFP to a peer-review of available modelling tools.</p>
<p>A: Strada was used by a JICA consultant. No peer review was performed by MCC or WSP. It is the A&amp;E entire responsibility to analyze and decide whether the data and models are reliable for use.</p>
<p>11.	Q: Will these models and all supporting data such as Data Collection Report, Demand Forecasting Report etc. be made available to the successful A&amp;E Consultant? Assume so due to the peer review task.</p>
<p>A: Yes. The data will be available to the selected bidder.</p>
<p>12.	Q: Under C.3) Modelling a) Current and Future Traffic the RFP mentions "Trip demand: Conduct and interpret origin/destination survey for targeted areas" and "Trip supply: Collect and analyze initial essential data: public transit routes in targeted areas". Please confirm that the targeted areas are similar and limited to the project locations/ areas as mentioned in the RFP.</p>
<p>A: Yes the Zone of Influence is the Yopougon Express in the north, VGE in the east, Boulevard du Port and de la Paix in the west.</p>
<p>13.	Q: How many license need to be provided of GIS "The A&amp;E shall purchase a sufficient number of ArcGIS Online licenses to fulfill its obligations and will also require any subcontractors to purchase a sufficient number of licenses to fulfill their obligations".</p>
<p>A: The number of licenses required is for the A&amp;E proposed team plus at least 2 for CNPC/MCA-CI, which will likely be temporary until CNPC/MCA-CI is able to purchase their own.</p>
<p>14.	Q: In the TOR, the section 10.4 states the below, could you please confirm that the 25 key and non-key personnel must be located in Abidjan for this project from beginning to the end?</p>
<p>A: Yes, all Key and Non-Key personnel must be located in Abidjan for this project. Administrative staff supporting the key and non-key personnel are not required to be located in Abidjan.</p>
<p>15.	Q: (Page 63, Section 4.9) The TOR states that "The A&amp;E shall provide sufficient workspace for 24 fully supplied workstations, office equipment (desks, chairs, lighting, and copier access) including internet/phone access for MCC, MCA-CI and its representatives in the design office during the course of the design phase. This design office shall be fully equipped and operational within two months of the NTP, including fully operational videoconferencing facilities."</p>
<p>a.	Should offerors assume that MCC/MCA are expecting a sectioned office space able to support 24 staff, with supporting stationary equipment in order to have clear division between MCC/MCA equipment/workspace and Offeror's equipment/workspace? In effect 2 separate office spaces (can be next to, adjacent or in the same building) with respective networks, printers, stationary equipment, etc. in order to clearly separate MCC/MCA and offerors costs.</p>
<p>A: Refer to TOR Subparagraph 4.9 Facilities to Be Provided by the A&amp;E. The requirement has been amended for the offeror to propose four (4) fully furnished workspaces, not 24.</p>
<p>The idea is to integrate the MCC/MCA-CI team into the A&amp;E design team offices in the same space. All costs associated with the startup and maintenance of the A&amp;E facility shall be included in the price. Also note that depending on availability of space, there is a possibility that MCC/MCA may negotiate a separate workspace arrangements with the Contractors after award. A flexible lease agreement would be ideal.</p>
<p>b.	Are offerors expected to incorporate the startup and maintenance cost of the MCC/MCA workspace in their budgets?</p>
<p>A: Yes.</p>
<p>16.	Q: Are base and option 1 T&amp;M or FFP?</p>
<p>A: Base and Option 1 will be FFP based on deliverables. Only Option 2 will be T&amp;M.</p>
<p>17.	Q: If it is FFP please confirm that the requested information (in section B.4. of the RFP) is not needed as we would provide cost by deliverable? As some of these deliverables will take multiple months, and iterative drafts and milestones, can offerors bill based on milestones that fit within the payment schedule?</p>
<p>A: Although payments will be made on FFP-basis for each deliverable, offerors are required to complete the 18R0006 RFP Pricing Excel spreadsheet, which incorporates the Section B.4 of the RFP. This is to ensure the labor and LOEs are fair and reasonable. Milestone-based payments will not be permitted.</p>
<p>18.	Q: Due to the Summer holidays in many countries, would MCC consider a three-week extension in order to provide Offerors the time to coordinate and collaborate with international and Ivorian partners?</p>
<p>A: An extension is agreeable. Proposals will now be due by 5:00pm ET on Monday, 20 August 2018.</p>
<p>19.	Q: For assignments with a duration exceeding 27 months (Option period 2), would a price adjustment provision for foreign and/or local inflation for remuneration rates be applied?</p>
<p>A: The Government has the unilateral right to exercise a 6-month extension as permitted by FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Service. MCC will use the latest rates and costs, most likely from OP 2 unless otherwise negotiated, for payment. No work will be performed under this contract beyond this 6-month extension.</p>
<p>20.	Q: What are the tax liabilities in Cote d'Ivoire for the offeror? Is there any bi-lateral Memorandum of Understanding in place between the US government and Cote d'Ivoire's Government?</p>
<p>A: Since this contract is funded with 609(g) and Compact CDF, it is entitled to the full benefit of the tax exemption found in those agreements.  The relevant agreements for the bidders to review, and which grant the tax exemption, are the 609(g) Agreement, the Compact, and the Program Implementation Agreement (PIA).  The PIA lays out the mechanism through which the Compact tax exemption will be carried out.  Because all taxes are exempt, the bidders' proposals should not include the value of any taxes; they will be entitled to a full exemption and will be assisted by CNPC, and later MCA-CI, in carrying out that exemption.  However, in the event the Government mistakenly charges a tax, the A&amp;E will be responsible for paying it, and will work with CNPC and the MCA-CI to later have the Government reimburse it.  CNPC and MCA-CI cannot be responsible for paying any taxes.</p>
<p>21.	Q: Do Offerors have to include all taxes in the financial proposal, including local identifiable indirect taxes such as VAT?</p>
<p>A: See the above in question 20; in the event that indirect taxes are not covered by the agreements, the A&amp;E shall separately identify them in the financial proposal.</p>
<p>22.	Q: Would the Offeror, sub-contractors and Experts be responsible for meeting all tax liabilities arising out of the Contract? If so, what would be the taxes?</p>
<p>A: Yes, see answer to Question 20. In the event that all of the taxes are not covered by the agreements, the A&amp;E shall separately identify these taxes in the financial proposal.</p>
<p>23.	Q: Would MCC consider payment currency other than US Dollars; possibly Euros or Francs CFA?</p>
<p>A: All payments will be made in US Dollars.</p>
<p>24.	Q: Are letters of commitment needed for key personnel being proposed?</p>
<p>A: Yes, a signed commitment letter is required from the proposed Project Manager/Team Lead (PM/TL).</p>
<p>25.	Q: Master's degree requirement - Can a certain number of years of experience substitute for a Master's degree?</p>
<p>A: No substitute for Master's degrees is acceptable.</p>
<p>26.	Q: Regarding the PM requirement of overseeing 3 projects per year at $30M each, could there be a substitution for the equivalent oversight in dollar value? (E.g. overseeing a $90M project per year, or 10 projects per year at $9M each?)</p>
<p>A: No substitute for this requirement is permitted; MCC is looking for a highly experienced PM in urbanized environments. This is a key requirement.</p>
<p>27.	Q: In TOR, on page 9 (Clause B) and on page 28 (Clause B.4), it is clearly indicated that under Option I (Phase II), "Tender Documents" will be submitted with the final engineering or final design report. But on page 1 of TOR in the "Table of Deliverables" the submission of "Tender Documents" is not mentioned. Please provide clarification.</p>
<p>A: Tender Documents are part of Deliverable 13. We have corrected the table of deliverables accordingly.</p>
<p>28.	Q: In the TOR, on page 2, Clause 1.1, para 4, it indicates that a due diligence of the proposal including technical and economic feasibility was conducted by WSP Canada. Again in the TOR on Page 21, para 2, it mentions that the MCC due diligence report has determined some of the actions. Can a copy of WSP Canada report be provided?</p>
<p>A: During the Pre-kickoff meeting in Washington DC, a detailed list of reports shall be provided to the winning firm. These cannot be made available at this time due to confidentiality reasons.</p>
<p>29.	Q: Section M.3. Factor 2 Past Performance states that firms will be evaluated on existing or prior contracts for engineering during the past five years. While the Section L.3.3 Volume II Past Performance mentions that Past Performance must have been performed within the last three years. Could you clarify?</p>
<p>A: Past Performance must have been performed within the last three (3) years.</p>
<p>30.	Q: The RFP states that MCC will provide the contractor with the iRAP evaluation. Is this the IRAP that WSP completed in the preliminary studies? Is the contractor expected to update this iRAP evaluation?</p>
<p>A: Yes, B.3 Preliminary Designs, 9th paragraph notes that the A&amp;E shall again hire iRAP to provide an updated assessment of the A&amp;Es recommended solutions with costs and star ratings. MCC will provide the completed iRAP assessment performed during the due diligence assessment upon award of the contract which identifies issues and needs.</p>
<p>31.	Q: Section C of Reference, point  B.1) Needs Assessment, states that the A/E contractor shall obtain from the Road Safety Agency (OSER) the police and gendarmerie yearly traffic accident on all 120 lane-km roads. Did the MCC confirm with OSER and gendarmerie that these data would be provided free of charge?  If not, can you please provide estimate of fees and time associated with obtaining this data?</p>
<p>A: The CNPC/MCA-CI shall facilitate the exchange of information from OSER to the A&amp;E without charge, however the quality and quantity of the available data will need to be determined by the A&amp;E.</p>
<p>32.	Q: If we provide charts electronically that are sized on 11' by 17' paper, do you have the capacity to print these out?</p>
<p>A: Per RFP L.2.1 Proposal Format, 11x17" format is permitted. (That's 11 inches by 17 inches.)</p>
<p>33.	Q: Can the charts be presented in pdf format?</p>
<p>A: Charts, graphs, and pictures as Addenda to the Technical Proposal may be presented in PDF format. Other technical documents must be submitted as non-Macro Word or Excel format (to allow searches). Refer to RFP L.4. Instructions to Offerors.</p>
<p>34.	Q: Section C now includes a Bathymeric survey of the Lagoon. What are the details and topography precision for this survey?</p>
<p>A: Bathymetric surveys are commonly available and periodically performed by the Port Authority in Abidjan. It is the A&amp;E responsibility to determine and justify data needs to obtain reliable designs.</p>
<p>35.	Q: Is a complete set of preliminary construction drawings required with Deliverable 10?</p>
<p>A: The Deliverable 10 Requirement has been modified to include preliminary design/sketches to illustrate ideas/concepts for evaluation.</p>
<p>36.	Q: Section C, C.4) Truck parking study states that the A/E contractor shall visit other truck parking locations in Dakar and Lome. However, the Truck Study Table of Contents specifies that truck parking efforts should be documented for at least 5 cities including Tema, Lome, and Dakar. How many visits to cities are required?</p>
<p>A: Five visits are required to Tema, Dakar, Cotonou, San Pedro and Lome. This has been clarified under Section C, C.4) Truck Parking to the following (including adjustment in the Table of Contents).</p>
<p>37.	Q: Section C, B.1) Needs Assessment states that the A/E contractor shall complete the stakeholder consultation previously undertaken by the CNPC-MCC (MCA C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire). Can you please provide an idea of the extent of information and completion status of this Needs Assessment?</p>
<p>A: The stakeholder consultations related to the truck parking issues have been minimal; the A&amp;E will need to perform the stakeholder mapping and consultations per an IFC PS compliant stakeholder engagement process.<br />&emsp;<br />SECTION B: SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS</p>
<p>B.1.	Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this request for proposals (RFP) is to select a firm to provide support to MCC Transport and Vertical Structure (TVS).

<p>a.	Of the total price in Section B (or the "Prices" section), only the amount stated on the contract award document or subsequent modifications is now available for payment and obligated under this contract. It is anticipated that from time to time, additional funds will be obligated under the contract until the total price of the contract is obligated.</p>
<p>b.	The Government is not obligated to pay or reimburse the contractor more than the amount obligated pursuant to this clause. The contractor agrees to perform the contract up to the point at which the total amount paid and payable by the Government (including amounts payable for subcontracts and settlement costs if this contract is terminated for convenience) approximates but does not exceed the total amount obligated.</p>
<p>c.	(1)  If the contractor considers the funds obligated under this contract to be insufficient to cover the work to be performed until the date specified in Section B, or another date agreed to by the parties, the contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing and indicate the date on which it expects expended funds to approximate 75 percent of the total amount obligated. The notice shall state the estimated amount of additional funds required to continue performance through the date for which incremental funds is provided.</p>
<p>(2)  If, after notification is provided pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, additional funds are not obligated, or an earlier date than the date in Section B of this clause is not agreed to, the contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance under this contract (including actions under the termination clause of this contract) beyond the funds obligated for contract performance.</p>
<p>d.

<p>MCC 52.232-73 Travel Reimbursement (May 2017)</p>
<p>Policy. When authorized as part of the Scope of Work on this contract/order and within the contract/order ceiling and as approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or other MCC officials as described below, travel expenses incurred in performance of technical directives issued under this contractor/order may be reimbursed as allowed by the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) in effect at the time of travel. MCC's supplemental policy interpretations are derived from the FTR and cannot grant additional benefits or adjust processes defined in the FTR. Supplemental policies of MCC set forth below:</p>
<p>a.	Traveler Responsibilities. All contractor travelers must:<br />1.	Exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business;<br />2.	Travel in accordance with the FTR and the MCC policies included in this document; and<br />3.	Pay any charges or fees associated with non-compliance of FTR or any MCC policies included in this document, and any expenses incurred for personal convenience. For example, the traveler may become personally responsible for travel costs associated with unauthorized use of other than coach class accommodations, failing to follow the Fly American Act requirements, exceeding per diem rates, changing departure or return flights, purchasing unapproved items, etc. regardless of the fact that travel arrangements may have been booked by others (e.g., Travel Agency).</p>
<p>b.	Cabin Class Standards<br />1.	The standard cabin class for contractor air-travel is coach class, regardless of destination or travel time.<br />2.	Coach "premium" class may be authorized for destinations which have a travel time of more than 14 hours, consistent with the Federal Travel Regulations and the approval standards outlined in paragraph (f) of this document.<br />3.	Business class travel accommodations will NOT be authorized except as determined through the approval process outlined in paragraph (f) of this document. This approval process is considered to be exceptional, to be part of a trip by trip analysis, and at the discretion of the government regardless of the destination or travel time.</p>
<p>c.	Airlines and Flights. In accordance with the Fly America Act, contractors must use a U.S. flag air carrier service for all travel funded by the government beginning or ending in the U.S. unless a specific exemption to the "Fly America" rule applies. Flights on U.S. air carrier pairings with foreign carriers (i.e., code share flights) are regarded as meeting Fly America requirements if the ticket is issued on the American carrier and there is an American carrier flight number.</p>
<p>d.	Limitations. Travel reimbursement, which is part of ODC, shall not exceed the authorized ODC amount on the contract. To be reimbursable, the travel expenses must be:<br />1.	Allowable under the FTR and the provisions of this contract/order and associated technical directives;<br />2.	Approved prior to travel expenditure by the COR; and<br />3.	Allocable and necessary for performance of this contract/order and associated technical directives.</p>
<p>e.	Reimbursement Requests. Travel reimbursement requests must be submitted in sufficient time for the COR to give prior approval, and must identify:<br />1.	The name of the traveler,<br />2.	Destination (s) including itinerary,<br />3.	Purpose of the travel, and<br />4.	Cost breakdown.<br />To be reimbursed, invoices including travel expenses must provide a detailed breakdown of the actual expenditures invoiced. Contractor shall maintain the original or legible copy of receipts for all travel expenses invoiced when the expenditure is $75.00 or more. MCC reserves the right to request evidence of any travel expense paid.</p>
<p>f.	Approvals. All travel expenses, including rental cars, must be approved by the MCC COR in writing in advance of booking any travel and incurring travel expenses. The following expense types require additional MCC pre-approvals beyond that of the COR. These additional approvals and associated justifications will be documented in writing:</p>
<p>1.	Business class<br />Business class travel is considered to be exceptional, to be determined as part of a trip by trip analysis, and at the discretion of the government regardless of the destination or travel time. To reflect the exceptional nature of this approval, the justification for use of business class must be prepared by the COR and approved in writing by the relevant Managing Director or Deputy Vice President of the organization requesting the contractor to travel. The single exception to requiring this justification and approval for every trip in question is when a State Department approved medical accommodation has been granted. In this case, the approval of the COR and the Contracting Officer only is required after verifying that the medical accommodation is effective for the trip in question and that sufficient funds are available. All justifications must verify that the contractor is required to report for duty the following day or sooner, that the travel time for the trip is at least 14 hours, and that a rest stop will not be taken en route. For audit purposes, all justifications and approvals to this effect must be retained by the COR and the contractor until contract closeout at which point all documentation must be provided to the Contracting Officer for incorporation in the contract file. Below are possible justifications supporting these exceptional requests:</p>
<p>A.	Medical accommodation. MCC has engaged the services of the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS), Federal Occupational Health Service (FOH), and Medical Employability Program (MEP) for medical accommodations due to disability adjudication. Requests for, and HHS  determinations on, medical accommodations for business class travel will be confidential, with only MCC's Travel Office receiving copies of the request and the MED/DP determination. Contractor travelers requesting medical accommodations based upon disability must complete the steps below. Forms are available from the MCC COR and/or PM.<br />a.	Contractor traveler completes the Medical Employability Case Transmittal Form, A127523-S192701-W190333. Form can be faxed to (301) 492-4783 or e-mailed to medical.employability@foh.hhs.gov with a copy to the MCC Travel Office at mccmedical@mcc.gov.<br />b.	Contractor traveler forwards Physician a copy of the Medical Accommodation Physician's form, which the physician completes, dates, and signs. Once signed, the traveler OR their physician e-mails a scanned .pdf attachment to HHS at medical.employability@foh.hhs.gov.  Alternatively, it can be faxed Attn: Medical Employability Program (301) 492-4783.<br />c.	Once both forms have been completed and sent, HHS makes a medical determination based on the information provided by the traveler and the traveler's physician on the HHS/FOH/EMP forms. FOH will send a letter to the POC listed on the transmittal form with recommendations. MCC will not approve any business class accommodations beyond normal MCC guidelines unless the traveler has completed the medical accommodation paperwork and received a positive response from FOH/MEP.<br />d.	Contractor must note that the process can take several weeks and will depend on how quickly HHS/FOH/MED receives the information (including communication with treating physicians).<br />B.	Sanitation/Health. Coach accommodations on an authorized/approved foreign air carrier do not provide adequate sanitation or health standards.<br />C.	Savings. Flying in non-coach status would involve significant cost savings to MCC when compared to the lowest price non-refundable or restricted coach class fare.<br />D.	Availability. No space is available in coach-class accommodations in time to accomplish the mission, which is urgent and cannot be postponed. (Note:  This justification should not be used based on the lack of advanced planning by the contractor or the COR).<br />E.	Security. Exceptional security circumstances require other than coach-class airline accommodations.<br />F.	Mission critical agency requirement. Circumstances in which a critical agency priority or project will incur delay or degradation without the intervention of a contractor and that intervention urgently requires other than coach class ticketing.</p>
<p>2.	Coach "premium" class must be approved by the COR, subject to the availability of funds on the contract/order, and:<br />A.	The origin and/or destination are OCONUS;<br />B.	The scheduled flight time including non-overnight stopovers and change of planes, is in excess of 14 hours. Scheduled flight time is the flight time between the originating departure point and the ultimate arrival point including scheduled non-overnight time spent at airports during plane changes. Scheduled non-overnight time does not include time spent at the originating or ultimate arrival airports;<br />C.	The contractor is required to report to duty the following day or sooner; and<br />D.	The contractor does not take a rest stop en route or a rest period upon arrival at the duty site.</p>
<p>3.	Rest stops must be approved by the COR and cannot exceed 24 hours.</p>
<p>Note:  Travelers may upgrade flight accommodations at their own expense or through the use of frequent flyer miles if the coach airfare is upgradeable at no extra cost to MCC.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

<p>Other Direct Charges (ODCs) will be reimbursed for direct costs as provided in the contract and/or task order. To be reimbursed, invoices including ODCs, must provide a detailed breakdown of the actual expenditures invoiced. The contractor shall maintain the original or legible copy of receipts for all ODCs invoiced. MCC reserves the right to request evidence of any ODC reimbursed. To assure timely reimbursement of ODC's, the contractor is strongly encouraged to submit charges within 45 days of the expense.</p>

<p>M.1.	Solicitation Provision Incorporated by Reference</p>
<p>52.217-5 Evaluation of Options</p>
<p>M.2.	Basis of Award</p>
<p>The Government intends to award one hybrid fixed price (FP) and time-and-materials (T&amp;M) contract with base period and option periods on a best value basis to the Offeror that is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government. Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest priced Offeror. However, if non-price factors are evaluated as comparatively equal between two or more Offerors, price may become a determinative factor. The Government reserves the right to award without discussion; therefore, it is incumbent upon all Offerors to submit their best proposal and price.</p>
<p>M.3.	Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors</p>
<p>All proposals will be evaluated based on the evaluation factors listed below.</p>
<p>The following evaluation factors and sub-factors are listed in descending order of importance, starting with the most important: (1) Technical Capability, (2) Past Performance, and (3) Price.</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability</p>
<p>1: Professional qualifications and specialized experience of key and non-key personnel necessary for satisfactory performance of required tasks.</p>
<p>A. Individual Team Members</p>
<p>MCC will evaluate resumes of key and non-key (core) personnel proposed per the requirements outlined under the terms of reference.</p>
<p>B. Proposed Team</p>
<p>MCC will evaluate the Offeror's comprehensiveness of the management and team structure as well as the proposed staffing plan. The proposed management and team will be considered for satisfactory performance and exhibiting in-depth knowledge of 1) urban transport engineering design involving complex urban traffic management challenges, 2) development of traffic model selection, calibration and simulations to appreciate congestion under various scenarios for deviation planning considering multiple simultaneous work sites in urban areas, 3) maintenance of host community welfare and safety during construction, including efficiencies in how the construction site is managed, notably in the organization, coordination and communication with drivers, pedestrians and local business owners, 4) development of measures to reduce impacts to the local populations from congestion and inconvenience such as providing integrated and temporary transit solutions, and the management of community input into the decision making process, 5) conducted resettlement, environmental and social safeguards studies under the IFC Performance Standards in a similar urban context involving complex traffic management challenges, and 6) development and use of GIS related applications, preferably in urban environments, covering engineering, environmental, traffic deviation management and resettlement aspects.</p>
<p>MCC will also evaluate the availability of resources, ability to timely deploy resources, ensure appropriate level of quality assurance and control, and ability to successfully perform relevant project to ensure successful execution of the task. MCC may request that the proposed Team Leader and other team members of the assignment provide a half hour presentation of the methodology, proposed team, and workplan for these specific tasks either via video conference or in-person post submittal of proposal. If a presentation is requested, the organization and strength of the presentation will be a contributing factor in the evaluation. MCC will evaluate the presentation to better understand the structure of the team and the team's ability to satisfy MCC's requirements.</p>
<p>MCC may evaluate the Offeror's plans and ability to retain highly qualified team members.<br /> <br />2: Experience and technical competence of firm for work required.</p>
<p>MCC will evaluate Offeror's demonstrated technical capability, clear technical approach, and realistic workplan, including work breakdown structure with level of effort for each project activity and summarized at the deliverable level on how it will deliver the project.</p>
<p>MCC will evaluate the Offeror's comprehensive technical approach and demonstrated understanding of the challenges/problems of potential tasks involved. MCC will also evaluate the Offeror's quality assurance approach and methods for performing each of the tasks outlined under the terms of reference as well as its subcontracting plans (if any).</p>
<p>MCC will evaluate the Offeror's firm evidence and clear demonstration of the understanding of the requirements for quality work and deliverables, including appropriateness of style, grammatical correctness, and data integrity relative to the writing necessary for the project.</p>
<p>The Offerors should possess:<br />1.	A minimum of five (5) years of related experience and over US$2 billion in value over the last 7 years in urban transport engineering field including project planning and design;<br />2.	A minimum of ten (10) years demonstrated experience in traffic modeling and simulation in an urban environment; <br />3.	Extensive prior environmental, social and resettlement experience per IFC Performance Standards working in/for low and middle-income countries;<br />4.	Demonstrated expertise and work experience relevant to this RFP.</p>
<p>Offerors must demonstrate their current knowledge of the construction methods, climatic conditions, geological features, local customs and regulations in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire in other similar regions. Offerors should identify any potential issues and risks that will likely be of concern for MCC and how the Offeror plans to mitigate, avoid, or manage them.<br /> <br />3: Proposed Methodology of the Offeror<br /> <br />MCC will evaluate the Offeror's detailed list of its plans, tools, methods, approaches, and systems the Offeror is considering for this assignment including the proposed justification. The Offeror shall provide no more than one page per tool, method, approach or system and one inter-relationship flowchart.<br /> <br />Factor 2: Past Performance</p>
<p>Firms will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for 1) engineering during the past five (5) years in highly congested, urban environments and for 2) environmental, social and resettlement work (including traffic management in congested urban environments) using IFC Performance Standards in developing countries, preferably in urban transport environments. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the requirement under consideration.</p>
<p>The offerors should have worked in urban infrastructure rehabilitation in cities of over 1 million people, on over 15 road projects (about 100km-lanes per year) with over 100,000 vehicles/day. These projects should have been completed over the last 3 years, with a preference for firms that have delivered at least US$2 billion in value in urban transport engineering field, including project planning and design, over the last 3 years.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to consider information from any other sources when evaluating the Offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price</p>
<p>The Government will examine price proposals for completeness, fairness, reasonableness, and realism by reviewing the Offeror's Price proposal, including the required 95332418R0006 RFP Pricing Excel document [attached]. Offerors are requested and encouraged to provide any discount.</p>
<p>Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate Proposals for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. This includes options under FAR clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services, which applies to this solicitation. Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>M.4.	Evaluation Methodology</p>
<p>A hybrid fixed price (FP) and time-and-materials (T&amp;M) contract with base period and option periods will be awarded to the Offeror whose proposals conform to the requirements outlined in this RFP and are most advantageous to the Government based on the best value determination. The Government will perform a comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages, including the significance, of each proposal as related to the Evaluation Factors above.</p>
<p>Based on the evaluated advantages and disadvantages, MCC will use the following adjectival ratings to evaluate the Offeror's technical proposal:<br />Technical Evaluation Ratings<br />Outstanding (O)	The proposal exceeds the Government's requirements. The Offerors has convincingly demonstrated that the requirements have been thoroughly analyzed, evaluated, and its proposal should result in outstanding effective, efficient, and economical performance under the contract. The proposal contains several significant advantages and no more than a few minor disadvantages. The performance risk is deemed to be very low.<br />Satisfactory (S)	The proposal meets the Government's requirements. The Offeror demonstrates a satisfactory understanding of the Government's needs. The proposal contains many advantages and only a few minor disadvantages. The performance risk is deemed to be low.<br />Marginal (M)	The proposal marginally satisfies the Government's requirements. The Offeror demonstrates a shallow understanding of the work to be accomplished. The proposal demonstrates several disadvantages and only a few advantages. The performance risk is deemed to be moderate to high.<br />Unsatisfactory (U)	The proposal fails to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. The proposal is incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, and/or so incorrect as to be unsatisfactory. The proposal contains significant disadvantages that are unacceptable. The performance risk is deemed to be very high.</p>
<p>MCC will use the following adjectival risk ratings to evaluate the Offeror's Past Performance proposal:<br />Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Low Risk	The Past Performance References have only positive reviews ("Satisfactory" or better using the CPARS standards) of the Offeror.<br />Moderate Risk	The Past Performance References have generally positive reviews ("Satisfactory" or better) with possibly some negative reviews (Marginal or worse) of the Offerors.<br />High Risk	The Past Performance References have mostly negative reviews ("Marginal" or worse) of the Offeror.<br />Neutral	Offerors without relevant Past Performance References will be assigned "Neutral" rating, which is neither favorable nor unfavorable to the Offeror.</p>
<p>In terms of relative weights, the Technical Capability is more important than the Past Performance and the Price factors individually. The Past Performance and the Price factors are listed in descending order of importance above.</p>
<p>The potential risk to the Government will also be evaluated. The technical and performance risk, based on the Offeror's evaluated technical capability and past performance, will be considered during the evaluation as well as any possible pricing risk. Throughout the evaluation, the Government may consider "correction potential" when a deficiency is identified.</p>
<p>M.5.	Selection Procedures</p>
<p>The Technical and Past Performance proposals will be evaluated by the MCC Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP). The Price proposal will be evaluated by the Contracting Officer and the Contract Specialist(s). During the evaluation, MCC may invite Offerors to make 30-minute oral presentations (in person or via Skype video) in support of their proposals and may request interview of the proposal team members. The proposed Team Lead must be present during the oral presentation, and MCC will make reasonable scheduling accommodations to allow the Team Lead to be present.</p>
<p>During the evaluation, MCC may contact the Offerors for further clarifications on their proposals. This is not a discussion or an opportunity to revise the proposal; it is simply to clarify a point. If the TEP determines that no one satisfies the Government's requirements, MCC may open discussion with every offeror and provide an opportunity to revise their proposals.</p>
<p>Upon MCC's initial proposal evaluation, the Contracting Officer/Contract Specialist will establish a competitive range of those that presented the best value to the Government. The competitive range will comprise of all Offerors that satisfy the following criteria. To qualify within the competitive range, the Offeror must present a Technical Proposal that is at least "Satisfactory" in all Technical evaluation factors and sub-factors, a Past Performance Proposal that is at least "Moderate Risk" or "Neutral", and a Price Proposal that is fair and reasonable. MCC will engage for a negotiation with those in the competitive range only. Those who do not initially qualify to be in the competitive range will be notified and will not be considered for award. Therefore, MCC encourages Offerors to submit their best proposal.</p>
<p>To establish the competitive range, MCC will perform a 2-step process:<br />1.	First, MCC will evaluate the Technical and Past Performance proposals of all responsive offers. MCC will assign ratings per M.3. Evaluation Methodology.<br />2.	Second, MCC will evaluate the Price proposal. To ensure fair and reasonable price, MCC will look at the those offerors with at a minimum of "Satisfactory" for Technical and at a minimum of "Moderate Risk" or "Neutral" for Past Performance to ensure fair and reasonable price. If there are three or fewer qualified offers, MCC will enter into discuss with all (three or fewer) qualified offeror(s) as they will be deemed to be in the competitive range. If there are more than three qualified offers, MCC will generate a normal distribution curve of their Prices and will consider those within one standard deviation from the mean to be in the competitive range. (MCC discourages too low a price to limit a buy-in and MCC discourages too high a price that is uncompetitive.) The offeror(s) in the competitive range will be invited for discussions and negotiations, and they will be further considered for award.</p>
<p>If no offeror satisfies the first criterion (Technical and Past Performance), MCC will hold discussions with every responsive offeror for an opportunity to revise their proposals, including Price. MCC will repeat this cycle until at least one Offeror satisfies the first criterion.</p>
