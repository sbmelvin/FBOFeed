<CONTACT>Debra M. Bridge Contract Specialist 7037871814     Debra.Bridge@mms.gov;
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described below.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541720: Research & Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities. The size standard for this NAICS Code is $6.0 million.  MMS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.  Based on the review of the responses to this RFI, the MMS may issue a small business set aside or full and open competitive requirement for Capability Statements and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against MMS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the MMS use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirements.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this RFI.  NOTE:  At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern.  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY:  Since U.S. Government decision-makers rely intrinsically upon effective communication with an informed public, this study aims to improve the ongoing technical dialogue between local citizens and the Alaska Regional Office of the Minerals Management Service (MMS), Offshore Program.  For this study, technical dialogue refers to the formal written process of two-way communication between local citizens and the agency concerning information about (or from) the MMS and its administrative activities with regard to resource evaluation, leasing, regulating industry, conducting environmental studies, and producing environmental assessments or impact statements in the Alaska region.  This study will investigate the effects and dynamics of written communication efforts in Cook Inlet and North Slope Borough planning areas as manifested by the medium of an Environmental Impact Statement.  It will seek to enrich the exchange of pertinent information and the pursuit of mutual understanding with diverse stakeholder groups by systematically identifying and analyzing communication methods and potential problems within a specific socio-cultural and politico-institutional context.  The study will also explore possible improvements through pilot-testing a series of experimental newsletters on targeted focus groups.  If significant communication obstacles can be identified and reduced through controlled testing, the study would then formulate plausible recommendations to help shape future agency interactions with the public.  In general terms, the study seeks to provide some fresh insight into the following types of questions:  Is the MMS successfully communicating the messages that it intends to communicate?  Are unintended messages being communicated?  Do local citizens feel adequately informed about the matters they deem pertinent?  How can the transmission of unintended messages be avoided?  How can the MMS enhance public opportunities to respond to agency messages in technically rich and precise language?  Are some stakeholder concerns inadvertently overlooked through the exiting NEPA process?  Are recent attempts to translate the EIS into minority languages effective?  Should the MMS supplement broadcast public documents with narrow-cast newsletter formats?  Can the MMS improve communication techniques through cost efficient measures?  By seeking to improve technical dialogue and reduce areas of miscommunication, this study will enhance opportunities for citizens of Alaskan coastal communities to participate more fully in the NEPA decision-making process.  Throughout, the primary orientation will be focus on conducting appropriate social research rather than on implementing "outreach" or public relations.  These overarching goals will be accomplished through the following intermediary objectives:  1.  Conduct a literature search (and key informant review) to document and assess alternative models of federal agency written communication efforts with local residents that are relevant to the goals of this study and related processes in the Alaska region; the review will specifically encompass appropriate linguistic considerations that may influence the effectiveness of technical dialogue;  2.  Sample and analyze the record of public comments from MMS planning activities in the Cook Inlet and Beaufort Sea to assess the range of communication issues and stakeholder perspectives specific to technical dialogue in the Alaska region;  3.  Interview appropriate MMS technical staff and management to identify and clarify the institutional parameters of potential communication obstacles with various stakeholders which reduce effective technical dialogue;  4.  Document key findings about technical dialogue and significant communication challenges in the Alaska region;  5.  Identify appropriate samples of study participants in communities on the North Slope and on the Kenai Peninsula and organize them into focus groups;  6.  Conduct a series of focus group meetings to assess public knowledge and attitudes about the OCS regulatory environment, the communication of scientific and technical information, and the scoping process in general;  7.  Collaborate with MMS management and staff to prepare experimental newsletters that will allow for testing the effectiveness of key agency technical messages across a range of social variables;  8.  Conduct a second series of focus group meetings to test a variety of newsletter messages against the baseline reactions; monitor changes in understanding, perceptions of technical information, and durability of opinions among study participants associated with new materials;  9.  Continue to test and monitor technical communication efforts in a limited and controlled newsletter format until a model based upon "lessons learned" can be implemented;  10.  Analyze and report the results of the focus group sessions in a final project report; report summary findings back to host communities; submit first draft of a scholarly publication;  SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 20 pages that details the small business firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting social science research of similar scope and complexity, knowledge of and experience with the NEPA process, familiarity with areas of Alaska's North Slope and Cook Inlet regions, timely delivery of final products, and a publication record in peer reviewed scientific journals.  Teaming or partnerships with other businesses or universities may be necessary to meet the requirements.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  RESPONSES ARE DUE no later than 3:00 p.m. E.T. on APRIL 22, 2004.  Please submit three (3) copies of your response to the attention of Debra Bridge, Contract Specialist, Procurement Operations Branch, Minerals Management Service, and if using regular U.S. mail - MS 2500, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA  20170; or if hand-delivered or using a courier service - 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions regarding this Request for Information should be submitted via email to debra.bridge@mms.gov.  Please include with your questions your full name, the RFI number and title "Researching Technical Dialogue with Alaskan Coastal Communities," your organization's name, complete address, and phone and fax numbers.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Ghana intends to issue a Management, Organizational and Business Improvement Services (MOBIS) Solicitation to implement its new Private Sector Competitiveness Strategic Objective, as described in the USAID/Ghana Country Strategic Plan (CSP) .  The Strategic Objective (SO) focuses on increasing the competitiveness of Ghana’s private sector in world markets. It contains two Intermediate Objectives: (i) to improve the policy, regulatory and institutional enabling environment for private sector competitiveness and (ii) to strengthen the capacity of private sector firms and farms to compete in world markets, with a focus on selected non-traditional exports (other than the traditional triumvirate of cocoa, gold and timber).  The priority policy and regulatory areas will be drawn from the Mission’s CSP.  The Private Sector Competitiveness SO is based on three key themes: competitiveness in world markets, technological modernization, and integration of all levels of private sector activity into demand-driven, export-led growth. As an example of the success of past efforts, non-traditional exports (NTEs) have grown from $68 million in 1992 to $551 million in 2003; and the share of NTEs in GDP reached about 25% in 2002, up from 7% in 1992. The MOBIS solicitation also contains components to implement an Initiative to End Hunger in Africa (IEHA) program for Ghana.  The anticipated release date for this (RfP) solicitation is on or about May 10, 2004.  The solicitation will be posted to http://www.fbo.gov/ and open to approved MOBIS contractors.  Organizations interested in this solicitation can receive information on becoming a GSA MOBIS contractor from www.gsa.gov.  Be aware, however, that any applicant who submits a proposal but is not on the approved list as of August 13, 2004 will not be considered eligible.

<DESC>Originally synopsized as F09603-04-R-47011P on July 09, 2003.  The Solicitation Number is changed FROM:  F09603-04-R-47011P TO: FA8519-04-R-70111P. Several changes have been made since the original synopsis and are captured in the following information.  This acquisition will be fully competitive using Best Value Performance Price Trade-off (PPT) evaluation procedures for NSN:  1670-00-820-4896CT, P/N:  50018-001, Noun:  Air Cargo Pallet, Type I, HCU 6/E. This acquisition is for the repair and new production of 463L Cargo Pallets.  Repair will be based upon a work specification and Air Force drawings.  New production will be based upon a military specification and Air Force drawings.  Pallets require repair due to damage incurred during routine loading/unloading, misuse, and improper storage.  New production will replace pallets lost during contingencies and meet increases in requirement.  New production quantities are estimated at 10,000 each for the basic contract period and 7,000 each for each option year. Pallet repair quantities are estimated as follows:  FY 04 – 6,000 EA; FY 05 – 18,000 EA; FY 06 – 14,000 EA; and FY 07 through FY 13 – 12,000 EA per year.   A requirements type contract will be awarded.  The contract will contain a basic award and nine (9) one-year options priced per occurrence based on level of effort for repair and based on firm-fixed pricing for new production. If the contract is awarded to an unproven source, the contractor shall complete a First Article Test (FAT) prior to repairing or producing any pallets. Note:  Notwithstanding the schedule stated in this contract, the provisions of Section 843 of the FY 2004 National Defense Authorization Act, may limit the period of this contract to not more than five (5) years.  If this limitation is subsequently determined to apply, the Government shall have the unilateral right to restructure this contract.  The contract will be restructured to have a basic period and four, twelve month option periods.  The rates included in the current contract will not be changed based on this restructuring and the application of the limitation shall not entitle the contractor to an equitable adjustment.  Also, the repair part of this acquisition falls under the Service Contract Act (SCA).  A wage determination for locality of the successful offeror will be incorporated into the contract.  If work is performed in the United States, the workforce will have to be paid no less than the minimum wage on the Wage Determination.  If you would like to look at the wage determination for your locality, please go to www.WDOL.gov.  It is important that you contact buyer Cyndi Brinkley by e-mail Cyndi.Brinkley@robins.af.mil, if you are interested in this acquisition.  Please plan to provide the following information:  Company Name, Cage Code, Place of Performance, and state if you are under an existing Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).  Even if you contacted the buyer from the initial synopsis, it is imperative that you make contact again and provide the requested information to be sure a Wage Determination (WD) is included in the RFP for your locality. Data will be available. This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only U.S. contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) and have a legitimate business purpose. U.S. contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with their request for solicitation.  To obtain certification, contact:  Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), ATTN:  U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI  49017-3084 or call the DLIS at (800) 352-3572.  The DLIS United States/Canada Joint Certification Lookup service is available via the Internet at:  http://www.dlis.dla.mil/ccal/. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation; request a solicitation from http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  
Estimated Milestones are changed to:  The approximate issue date of a draft solicitation is 18 Dec 03 with comments due from industry on 20 Jan 04.  Issuance of a Final Request for Proposal is estimated on 02 Feb 04 with receipt of proposals due 02 Mar 04.  All potential offerors should contact the buyer, Cyndi S. Brinkley at 478-222-1917 or by e-mail, for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition.

<CONTACT>Susan Cowin Contracting Officer 8015394177     susan_cowin@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management, Utah State Office, Salt Lake City, Utah, has a requirement for noxious weed (Scotch Thistle, Whitetop, Knapweed & Broadleaf Pepperweed) control by ground application.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Number for this Request for Quotes is JSQ044038.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-20, dated February 23, 2004.  Contractor is to provide all equipment, supplies, personnel and supervision to complete this requirement.  Location of the treatment area is within the area of the Cedar City Field Office.  PLEASE CONTACT SUSAN COWIN AT (801)539-4177 FOR FAX (801)539-4222 FOR MAPS OF THE TREATMENT AREAS.  The area to be treated is located in Iron, beaver and Washington counties, Utah.  The estimated total week area is approximately 2500 acres of BLM land.  The areas to be treated range from scattered single plants, several plants at a location, concentrations of plants on approximately 1/10 acre and up to areas as large as 40 acres where plants are consistent across the area.  A show-me tour is scheduled for APRIL 14, 2004, 8:00, to meet at the Cedar City BLM Office on April 14, 2004 at 10:00am. STATEMENT OF WORK:  Noxious weed (Scotch Thistle, Whitetop, Knapweed, Broadleaf pepperweed) control by ground application of herbicides and/or hand cutting.  The goal of this proposal is to eventually eradicate these species on BLM administered lands within the area of the Cedar City Field Office. This area is Iron and Beaver Counties and a small part of Washington County. Refer to the map which shows locations of general areas of noxious weeds. b. DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  1.Application of herbicides in solution and/or hand cutting with (contractor-furnished) property.  A description of the work setting is as follows:  The areas to be treated range from scattered single plants, several plants at a location, concentrations of plants on approximately 1/10 acre and up to areas as large as 40 acres where plants are consistent across the area (see attached maps).  The areas shown on the maps to designate the weed areas are either solid marked (approx. 1 acre or less) or crosshatched (larger than 1 acre) to provide an indication of the area containing noxious weed species. The areas of Whitetop, Knapweed, and Broadleaf pepperweed are noted on the maps next to the mapped area. All other mapped areas are Scotch Thistle. Scotch Thistle plants will be in all stages of growth, including seedlings, rosettes and maturing plants with flower stalks.  Estimated total acres of weed areas on the field office area is 2500 acres of BLM land. This is not to mean that 2500 acres are covered with the target species. It is to mean that there are approximately 2500 acres, which contain the target species in various densities. Of the total acres, approx. 2220 acres are Scotch thistle, approx. 275 acres is whitetop and the remaining acres are Knapweed and broadleaf pepperweed. The areas shown on the attached maps comprise much more than 2500 acres but are shown on the maps as such to reflect the amount of area which must be covered in order to locate the weed areas. 2. All areas of Whitetop, Knapweed, and broadleaf pepperweed will be treated first. The Scotch thistle areas in Iron and Washington counties will then be treated, followed by Scotch thistle in Beaver County. If weed areas outside the mapped areas are located by the contractor, the COR will be informed and a decision made by the COR as to whether the area will be treated. If areas outside the mapped areas are treated by the contractor without prior approval, no payment will be made for these areas. Additional areas approved for treatment will be completed and paid for as described in Item No. 2, SF-18 Request for Quotation. LOCATION:  Work under this Contract is located on BLM lands in Iron and Beaver Counties and a small part of Washington County, Utah.  The work locations are shown on the attached maps.  Whitetop, Knapweed, and broadleaf pepperweed areas are designated as such.  All other areas are Scotch thistle. d. ACCESS TO THE WORK:  Dirt roads and off-road travel by vehicle and/or foot travel. CERTIFICATION: Contractor will furnish to BLM, a copy of written certification from the supplier of the herbicides that it conforms to the requirements of this contract. Also, will furnish to BLM, a copy of the certification that the contractor and any employees who will apply chemicals are certified commercial herbicide applicators. This certification must be supplied to BLM prior to start of work on the contract. WORK LIMITS:  The Government will define with maps the outer perimeter of areas to be treated and areas within such perimeter, if any, which are to be excluded from treatment.  Perimeters adjacent to State or private lands will be identified on the maps and shown to the contractor in the field. On site inspections by potential bidders, prior to bidding on the contract, are highly recommended. This is due to the high variability, from year to year, in density of the target species and other site conditions. g. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:  No less than 95 percent of all plants of the target species listed above on all sites within the identified perimeters must be killed by treatment with either herbicide or by hand cutting. A site is defined as anywhere at least one plant occurs. Plants may be in all growth stages from seedlings to maturing plants. The intent is for all plants to be killed prior to flowering. However, any plants treated in the flower stage must be killed before the flowers begin to dry up. If Scotch thistle plants are found which are beginning to flower, or are in any other stage of active flowering, these plants will not be treated with herbicide but will be cut down and all flower heads separated from the plant. These flower heads can be left on site. The flower of Scotch thistle is colored purple. Any shade of purple, which is visible from start of flowering through full flowering, will be the plants not treated with herbicide. The project inspector will determine when plants are showing the purple color and will, immediately, inform the contractor. Any Scotch thistle plants with at least one flower which has begun to dry up to the point that the project inspector determines the plant will produce viable seed, will be considered not treatable under this contract. If this occurs, the contract will be adjusted down by percentage of total acres which become not treatable. This percentage will be determined by the COR. To meet this requirement may be difficult on some areas and involves spending an adequate amount of time. Due to the habitat range and growth habits if Scotch thistle, it can be difficult to locate and time consuming to treat. Monitoring for compliance will be completed by BLM. The method of monitoring will be agreed by BLM and the contractor.  The treatment will be in the spring.  Beginning of treatment is dictated by the phenological progression of the plants.  Start of treatment is after emergence of spring seedlings and well before any of the plants have started to form flower heads.  Contractor must return to the site and retreat any areas which are not in compliance with treatment specifications within 3 days of being informed of the noncompliance.  Failure to do so will result in the penalty.  These treatment specifications as found in this contract are those described in the Statement of Work. A schedule of proposed treatment dates will be supplied to the COR. This will be updated each week if changes are needed.  Contractor will report to the COR at least once weekly as to the progress of the project. This may be done through the project inspector.  All herbicides will be applied in accordance with EPA labels and in compliance with all guidelines and restrictions. Contractor will complete a herbicide application form as required for BLM files. This form will be completed daily and all forms returned to BLM prior to final payment of the contract. The forms will by supplied by BLM. CONTRACTOR-FURNISHED ITEMS:  All personnel, materials, and equipment required to complete the project.  This includes herbicide application equipment, vehicles, fuel, dye, water, and any other associated tools and equipment.

ATVs are recommended to assist in covering the areas.  Back pack pumps or hand tools are also recommended to cover areas which are difficult to reach with trucks or ATVs.  METHOD OF TREATMENT:  The weed plants can, generally, be treated by use of either herbicide or hand cutting or a combination of both. Two exceptions to this are as follows. 1- Approximately one third of the area of broadleaf pepperweed will require hand cutting. These are the plants which are near or in live water. The area containing these plants is on approximately one third of an acre. 2- Scotch thistle plants which are in any part of the flowering stage will be hand cut. This does not include plants on which the flowers are drying up. These plants are considered to be not treatable under this contract.  HERBICIDE METHOD:  If treatment by herbicide is used, the following will apply. Herbicide and Dye:  Shall conform to the following: Weedmaster (Dicamba + 2,4-D), Picloram (Tordon 22K), Escort XP (Metsulfuron methyl).

Escort XP at no less than .038 pound and no more than .075 pound active ingredient per acre. Areas of Application:  Approximately 20 percent of the treat areas will receive Tordon 22K.  These areas are (1) all areas east of Interstate Highway I-15 from highway U-20 area south to Kanarraville area.  This is the Parowan front area.  (2) The areas on Quichapa area and New Harmony chaining.  These areas are west and northwest of Kanarraville (see attached maps).  Approximately 70 percent of the treat areas will receive Weedmaster and the remaining 10 percent of the treat areas will receive Escort XP.  Transportation of Herbicide:  The Contractor shall load and transport herbicide from the contractor's home base to the work site and between sites according to all applicable laws and regulations.  Upon completion of the work or termination of the contract, all unused herbicide shall be returned by the contractor to the contractor's home base.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Basic Research Laboratory  (BRL), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure, on a sole source basis,  record abstraction, data entry, and file development from the initial four months of the follow-up to the Stavanger Nested Case-Control Study of Preeclampsia with Norwegian University of Science and Technology, School of Medicine, NO-7489 Trondheim, Norway.   The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  Background: The Basic Research Laboratory, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, requires the data entry of and file development from the initial follow-up to the 1993 birth cohort of the study known as: The influence of preeclampsia on hormonal and anthropometric status in boys and girls at 10 and 13 years of age: Follow-up of the Stavanger population-based nested case-control study, (heretofore known as the Puberty Follow-Up Study).   The ultimate purpose of this research project is to explore the biological mechanisms underlying why women who suffered from preeclampsia during pregnancy and their offspring are at significantly reduced risk of breast cancer (in mothers and daughters of that pregnancy) while the male offspring are at the lowest risk of prostate cancer identified in the literature.  Information for the data file is obtained from anthropometric measurements, blood analysis, and pubertal assessment of the children when they were recently seen at the Rogaland Central Hospital, Stavanger Norway and from child and maternal questionnaires completed at the same time.  Given the large sample size of 1,000 in the original birth study, there is the opportunity to have the statistical power to compute hormonal and other growth factor differences in the study population.  Dr. Lars Vatten was the primary author to the research based in the Rogaland Hospital in Stavanger, Norway of the population-based study of women diagnosed with preeclampsia in pregnancy and their offspring and a comparable set of normotensive controls.  His analysis of the original birth study identified significant growth retardation in newborns of preeclamptic in contrast with newborns of normotensive mothers as well as hormonal differences in the cord blood of the offspring of the two pregnancies.  These hormones are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer in animal models and in human epidemiologic research.  Dr. Vatten and his team therefore have the experience with the study cohort and have collaborated with the Rogaland Central Hospital to develop the file and link to other available registries in Norway. This is the only population-based study to date of preeclampsia and these women represent all women, who were diagnosed with preeclampsia in pregnancy in the birth years from 1993 through 1995 who resided in the Stavanger area in Norway.  The NCI has the opportunity to conduct a follow-up of these mothers and children, linking with the original study database.  The questionnaire items focus on dietary intake during the index pregnancy and since the birth of the index child, lifestyle and demographic characteristics, family history of cancer, and family history of reproductive disease, including preeclampsia in the mother's and biological father's families.  Period of Performance:   May 1, 2004 through September 30, 2004.  The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, School of Medicine is the only known source to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned requirements. The Investigator has been involved in the original birth study and has worked for many years with the Medical Director of The Rogaland Central Hospital.  Their insights from the original study as well as their scientific leadership in the area of preeclampsia provide extraordinary knowledge and experience in the Norwegian linked birth-cancer registry system, the public health record system, and in this particular study population.  They have worked with the study data sets over the years and can thereby lead a team in the data analysis of the initial follow-up study.  Therefore the background of the population, nature of its low risk for cancer, as well as the expertise and educational background of the Investigator and his team of data abstractors and analysts are all reasons for the sole source justification. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on April 16, 2004.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NCI-40052-NG.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Basic Research Laboratory  (BRL), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure on a sole sourece basis, Development of data collection manuals, the invitation and clinical follow-up of the 1993 birth cohort to the Stavanger Nested Case-Control Study of Preeclampsia  with the Rogaland Central Hospital, PO Box 8100, NO-4068 Stavanger, Norway.  The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  Background: The Basic Research Laboratory, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, requires the development of manuals of operation for the conduct of a prospective study of puberty in and the initiation of the first three months of the prospective study in the 1993 birth cohort members and their parents to the study known as:  The influence of preeclampsia on hormonal and anthropometric status in boys and girls at 10 and 13 years of age:  Follow-up of the Stavanger population-based nested case-control study (heretofore referred to as the Puberty Follow-Up Study).  The Puberty Follow-Up Study has a high-risk population of mothers and children participated in a birth study when the mothers suffered from preeclampsia during the index pregnancy in comparison with an age-matched set of normotensive controls (mothers and their offspring).  The ultimate purpose of this research project is to explore the biological mechanisms underlying why women who suffered from preeclampsia during pregnancy and their offspring are at significantly reduced risk of breast cancer (in mothers and daughters of that pregnancy) while the male offspring are at the lowest risk of prostate cancer identified in the literature.  The information collected during the pretest and pilot enabled the investigators at NCI, in collaboration with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and The Rogaland Hospital, Stavanger, Norway to develop a follow-up of the cohort with the ultimate goal of identifying hormonal and other mechanisms associated with the lowered cancer risk in this population.  They have conducted the only population-based study of women diagnosed with preeclampsia in pregnancy and their offspring and a comparable set of normotensive controls.  The birth study utilized data from the birth registry in Norway and stored cord bloods to demonstrate hormonal and anthropometric differences in the offspring of the preeclamptic and normotensive mothers.  The NCI has the opportunity to conduct a follow-up of these mothers and children, linking with the original study database.  The questionnaire items focus on dietary intake during the index pregnancy and since the birth of the index child, lifestyle and demographic characteristics, family history of cancer, and family history of reproductive disease, including preeclampsia in the mother's and biological father's families.   The manuals of operation will provide the guidelines for questionnaire reported data, blood and clinical evaluations on the children as the cohorts are followed.  It is NCI's intent to utilize the study manuals of operation in the conduct of the first three months of the clinical study follow-up of the members born in 1993 as the offspring enter puberty and adolescence, when hormonal and other growth factors might differ appreciably from children of normotensive pregnancies. Period of Performance:  May 1, 2004 through August 30, 2004.  Rogaland Central Hospital is the only known source that can provide the aforementioned requirements.  The Rogaland Hospital has as its director, the original Principal Investigator to the Stavanger Nested Case-Control Study of Preeclampsia, who has had direct contact with all the families involved in the original study, thereby having credibility and links to the study population of interest.  The training in obstetrics and gynecology along with the experience of the Pediatric Department in adolescent medicine has given the team the knowledge and background to develop the manuals of operation.   Therefore the background of the population, nature of its low risk for cancer, as well as the expertise and educational background of the original principal investigator and his team are all reasons for the sole source justification.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP)] for hydrogen-oxygen regenerative  fuel cells (RFC) for evaluation and characterization tests to be performed at GRC. The RFC is an electrochemical system that collects and stores solar energy during the day then releases that energy at night, thus making the Sun’s energy available 24 / 7. It consists of a dedicated hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell stack and an electrolyser stack, plus all the ancillary equipment required to (1) absorb electrical power from an outside source and store it as pressurized hydrogen and oxygen and (2) make electrical  power from the stored gases, saving the product water for re-use during the next cycle.  The NASA Glenn Research Center has constructed  a  “brassboard” test rig built from off-the-shelf  hardware components to reduce to practice the operation of RFC as an energy source.  To further mitigate technical risk, NASA Glenn desires to evaluate state-of-the-art lightweight critical components utilizing the “brassboard” test rig. NASA recognizes component weight as a major critical challenge for the high altitude, long endurance solar-electric aircraft application, projecting a system energy storage density requirement of 600 Whr / kg.  Furthermore, NASA recognizes the investments made in high power density hydrogen oxygen PEM fuel cell and electrolyser stack technology by NASA space programs and other Government organizations, and desires to evaluate the current state-of-the-art for the solar electric aircraft application. The RFP contains specifications for both the fuel cell and electrolyzer stack components.  Offerors may propose furnishing either fuel cell, electrolyzer stack, or both, quantity of 1 each, with an option for up to 2 additional fuel cells or electrolyzer stacks.   The two components furnished will use the current state-of-the-art and will be evaluated by NASA/GRC in terms of specific power, conversion efficiency, and durability to establish the feasibility for the ambitious goal of 600 Whr/ per energy storage system kg.  A 600 Whr/kg closed cycle RFC would be the highest storage capacity and lowest weight of any non-nuclear energy storage device.  Realization of the system level goal can lead to the successful demonstration of a mission capable unmanned solar electric aircraft with potentially unlimited endurance.	In addition to solar aircraft the closed cycle RFC is also applicable to a wide variety of space and planetary surface missions: hence, there is widespread interest throughout NASA. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. The procurement will be issued using full and open competition.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 500 employees, respectively.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about April 15, 2004 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about May 17, 2004. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GRC Business Opportunities home page is  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=22   It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.   Upon issuance of the RFP, all contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or fax).  Telephone questions will not be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate a follow-on contract with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, New Iberia Research Center (NIRC), to continue support for the work needed for the veterinary care, technical support care, treatment and housing of a research animal colony of approximately 73 nonhuman primates involved in the study of slow, latent and temperate infections of the nervous system caused by conventional and unconventional viruses.    Included in the nonhuman primates are 65 chimpanzees, 1 gibbon, and 7 New World monkeys.   In addition, the contractor shall continue to support the work needed for the animal housing, veterinary care, management and maintenance of the NINDS specific pathogen free rhesus macaque breeding colony. A new 5-year award (June 2004 to July 2009) is anticipated.  The present population of the rhesus monkey breeding colony is approximately 128 monkeys.  This new work will require NIRC to continue performing all of the aforementioned tasks.  NIRC provides on-site veterinary care, extensive knowledge of and experience with infectious diseases, and is well versed in the prescribed guidelines on the use and care of laboratory animals.  In addition, NIRC provides AAALAC accredited state-of-the-art facilities, which includes indoor and outdoor caging for the animals noted above.  The research animal colonies at NIRC are housed separately by species, and supporting clinical examining and treatment rooms, and surgical rooms are adjacent to the housing areas, all of which are AAALAC accredited. NIRC has been determined to be the only responsible source because of the staff’s familiarity with the various NINDS on-going studies supported by the NIRC.  To move the animals to a new location would be very disruptive to them, since a number of them have been at NIRC for over twenty years.  In addition, relocation may jeopardize the research activities, and it would be very expensive to the NINDS to move the animals to a new facility.  NIRC has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their experience to date under the contract.  Inherent duplication of the cost to the Government and unacceptable performance delays make competition for the additional labor effort unfeasible.  Organizations that believe they have the qualifications and capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of staffing, facilities, and methodologies currently in place to the Contracting Officer at the above address within 45 days from the date of this announcement.  An organization must have an ongoing program with available staff with substantial experience in veterinary care, technical support care, treatment and housing of a research animal colony of nonhuman primates, and expertise in veterinary care, and management and maintenance of the NINDS specific pathogen free rhesus macaque breeding colony, to carry out the work described above.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a formal solicitation, nor an announcement that a Request for Proposals (RFP) is available.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. Email: mwebster@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Ing. Norman Garcia, Minister, Secretaría de Industria y Comercio, Tegucigalpa, Honduras,  C.A., Phone:  (504) 239-3493, 235-3699, Fax:  (504) 235-3686, e-mail: ngarcia@sic.gob.hn.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to the Honduran Secretaría de Industria y Comercio (SIC), in the development of a web-based Trade Information Exchange Portal and an associated support structure for effective dissemination of key information needed to enhance bilateral trade.

In TCB-related discussions with the Honduran delegation to the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement negotiations, government Ministries and private Trade Associations, a common hurdle emerged focused on severe deficiencies in the area of trade information access and training.  While some trade information is available, it is very incomplete and is frequently locked away in paper files and reports that lack the ready access and speed of delivery required to trade effectively in the new, Internet-driven marketplace.  To compete effectively and provide the kind of quick access to information that international trading partners demand, Hondurans need a mechanism to access information and communicate their trade capabilities via the Internet.

The objective of the proposed project is to provide technical assistance to Honduras in the development of a web-based Trade Information Exchange Portal and an associated support structure for effective dissemination of key information needed to enhance bilateral trade.  The project has two key phases: a detailed design and planning phase, followed by a rapid deployment phase, to ensure delivery of the desired benefits in trade capacity building during the early stages of CAFTA implementation.

The key components of the project are: 
·	To provide technical assistance for the development of the Trade Information Exchange Portal itself, tying together, organizing, and disseminating information that is currently dispersed across a variety of government Ministries, private Trade Associations, and external sources.  Most important, the Portal needs to “plug” the substantial gaps that exist in currently available data (especially from external sources).
·	To develop a training program to ensure that the Trade Portal is effectively maintained and that end users in the business community can make good use of the information and services provided.
·	To develop a promotion program to enhance awareness within the business community of the capabilities of the Trade Portal and its importance in promoting bilateral trade.

The Trade Portal itself is intended to provide: (1) trade-related information in a central, easily accessible location, (2) information integration and analysis capabilities, and (3) information dissemination channels to end users in the business community.

The general objective of this Technical Assistance is to provide technical assistance to Honduras in the development of a web-based Trade Information Exchange Portal and an associated support structure for effective dissemination of key information needed to enhance bilateral trade.

The project has two key phases: a detailed design and planning phase, followed by a rapid deployment phase, to ensure delivery of the desired benefits in trade capacity building during the early stages of CAFTA implementation.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following: 

Task 1: 	Assessment of Trade Information Resources, Needs and Plans
Task 2: 	Design of Trade Information Portal
Task 3: 	Development of a Transition Plan
Task 4: 	Implementation of the Trade Information Portal
Task 5: 	Develop and Deliver a Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $402,525 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 12:00pm local Tegucigalpa, Honduras time, May 10, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division intends to enter into negotiations on a sole-source basis with Boeing Aerospace Support via modification to an existing delivery order to continue development and demonstration of specialized tools.  This effort is intended to facilitate the concept that the next higher level assembly diagnostic information and historical maintenance of the Smart TPS can be utilized to enhance the effectiveness of the US Navy Support Equipment to achieve:    1) reduced fault isolation times; 2) increasing diagnostic accuracy, thereby reducing Can Not Duplicates (A799s).  This increase in effectiveness will dramatically reduce support costs.  Tasks have been identified to further mature the Smart TPS tool set by integrating other disparate systems into the original concept with an integrated solution to be demonstrated which satisfies this requirement.  Boeing Aerospace Support, as the sole designer and developer of the Smart TPS tool set, is the only known firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical data, software and test equipment to enhance the Smart TPS tool set.  The Government does not own the technical data and does not have rights to the source code.  This notice is not intended as a request for proposals; however, all interested sources must submit a proposal not later than 15 days following the date of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to open this procurement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation package will be available.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor (PV) to provide items under the general groupings of lumber and related products and woodworking machinery and tools for the Korea and Japan regions.  A PV, or integrated suppliers, can be defined as the designation of a single source of supply for a wide range of products.  The requirements covered under this solicitation include, but are not limited to, Federal Supply Class (FSC) 55: softwood lumber, hardwood lumber, plywood/veneer, poles, pilings, ties, crossarms, dowels, plugs, stakes, doors and moldings and FSC 32: sawmill and planing mill machinery, woodworking machines/tools and attachments for woodworking machinery.  This is a representative list and should not be considered exhaustive of all products that will be required of the acquisition.  The intended solicitation will cover military customers located in Korea and Japan (including Okinawa).  Prospective offerors should have the capability to deliver lumber and related products as well as woodworking machinery and tools within the region.  The intended solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contract being an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for two (2) base years and three (3) one-year options.  Estimated value of this acquisition is $6,800,000 for the base period; $17,000,000 for total contract period.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>****THE DATE AND TIME FOR RECEIPT OF RESPONSES HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO 3:00 PM, APRIL 8, 2004**** ****AN ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT/SIR1 TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED REGARDING THIS REQUIREMENT**** ****ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED NO LATER THAN WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 2004, IN ORDER TO POST THE RESPONSES ON THE INTERNET**** The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for providing information technology (IT) and related support services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The contractor will be responsible for providing program management and for assuming a partnership role with the Government in providing technical solutions and in securing and retaining business.  Requirements are defined further in the contract Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Interested parties are encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page. This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) of 1997.  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of Best Value to the FAA.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519, Other Computer Related Services - $21/million will be used for this acquisition.  Interested vendors that have experience in IT Support Services are to submit a FAA Business Declaration form with their response to this announcement/SIR1.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement/SIR1. The FAA is committed to the socio-economic goals of the Department of Transportation and the Agency for Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman-owned, and Service-Disabled Veteran business arrangements.  Therefore, contractor demonstration of commitment to these goals enters into the FAAs selection of the submittal representing the overall best value for those services identified and enumerated in the PWS.  It is highly desirable that all offerors recognize and demonstrate their commitment to these goals through their respective subcontracting and/or teaming arrangement(s).  Close monitoring of the accomplishment of the goals will be an important post-award activity.  The vendor will be expected to make a good faith effort to achieve the following subcontracting goals: Percentage of Total Contract Value 			Teaming/Subcontracts to SB				26%* 			Teaming/Subcontracts to SDB				10% 			Teaming/Subcontracts to WOB				 5% 			Teaming/Subcontracts to SD/VOB			 1% 			*The 26% figure represents the entire small business subcontracting program goal. Subcontracting goals will be an evaluated factor in Phase 2 of the procurement process. This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  The initial phase involves the announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this SIR. Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendors eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendors eligibility pursuant to this SIR.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendors information.  Any statement included in a vendors response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  Documentation includes, but is not limited to, formal resumes, licenses, financial statements, work plans, etc.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2x11, printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendors response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility. SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendors submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendors eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR. (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable.) 	1.  Past Performance and Experience: (Note: Past performance represents how well an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has done it.  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the PWS.) 		(a) Vendor must have experience with IT and related support services as identified in the attached PWS.  Vendors shall provide a list of relevant past and present contracts performed for Federal, State, or Local Governments or commercial sources within the past five (5) years involving effort of same or similar complexity, magnitude, and level.  The vendors documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information stated below. 		(b) Vendors may select no more than three (3) relevant contracts for which to provide past and present contract performance information, which summarizes contractual efforts the vendor considers relevant to this acquisition.  The past and present contract performance information should demonstrate the vendors ability to perform the proposed effort.  Vendors should address performance problems (e.g., cure notices, contract disputes, terminations for default, litigation, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state, or local levels, etc.) as well as performance successes (e.g., technical innovations, awards, etc.).  Vendors should limit their discussion of performance experience to three (3) pages for each contract selected for submission in response to this Announcement/SIR1.  Performance experience summaries may be tailored to address the vendors performance experience to include each of the following areas corresponding to the PWS: 			(i)	System Development and Integration 			(ii)	System Management and Hosting 			(iii)Telecommunications 			(iv)	Information System Security 			(v)	Information Media 			(vi)	Office Automation 			(vii)Project Management 			(viii)IT Training 		(c)	Administrative Data: 			(i)	Offeror Name (Company/Division) 			(ii)	Contract number and contract type 			(iii)Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any 				Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, Wal-Mart, etc.) 			(iv)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar  				value (including options) 			(v)	Original completion date and final (or current) completion 				date 			(vi)	A brief description of the contract effort 			(vii)Largest number of employees associated with direct contract 				effort 			(viii)Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the  				Government Contracting Officer(s) (procuring or  				administrative); for non-government contracts, provide the  				name, address, telephone and FAX numbers of business point  				of contact, liaison, etc.  The offeror is responsible for 				verifying references before submission to ensure all 				information is correct. 		(d)	Vendors must submit an experience matrix.  The vendor should ensure that the information provided in the experience matrix corresponds to the information required above.  The experience matrix will be used to quickly ascertain each vendors relevant experiences for successful execution of this contractual effort.  The top row of the matrix contains areas of experience.  The vendor shall fill in the matrix identifying the relevant contractual effort(s) that provided the experience.  Each contract or subcontract (including contract number) on which experience was gained in the noted areas shall be entered into the matrix.  The contracts may include Government and commercial (prime and subcontracts) and may include contracts for subcontractors, which will be members of the vendors team.  Each block in the matrix will be filled in with two letters or it will remain empty to indicate no experience is that area.  The first letter will be either P or S, to denote that the experience was gained as either a Prime Contractor or as a Subcontractor.  The second letter will be either H, M, or L, to denote a High, Medium, or Low relevance assessment by the contractor to that of the IT support services effort. 		(e) Where inquiries made pursuant to (c)(viii) reveal the vendors performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 2.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must demonstrate an ability to provide management and staffing commensurate with the demands of this requirement in the following areas: 		(a) Vendors must demonstrate that a qualified Program Manager and Alternate Program Manager will be available at the time of contract award that meets the qualifications/requirements identified in the PWS.

(b) Vendors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully managed 250 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to: 1) a spreadsheet identified month by month for the annual period containing a list of employees and their managers, and the contracts on which they performed, 2) signed certification with a list of employees with date of employment including employees managers, and/or 3) summary of payroll records by each employer organization (contractor and subcontractors/teaming participants). 		(c) Vendors must document/demonstrate that they have competitive employee benefits to recruit and retain a highly skilled workforce.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to, a summary by each employer organization (contractor and subcontractors/teaming participants) for the following:   			(i)	Health insurance plan 			(ii)	Retirement or pension plan 			(iii)Annual leave/Sick leave plan Summary should include the name of the insurance company(ies), company contributions, and date of inception. 		(d) Vendors must have an ongoing technical training program for employees and subcontractor employees.  Vendor is to provide documentation to substantiate training program.

<DESC>This is an annoucement of the Small Business Administration's Disaster Loss Verfication Competition being conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003.  The Competitive Sourcing Official is Lewis D. Andrews, Jr.  The Agency Tendor Official is Herbert L. Mitchell.  The Contracting Officer is Janet C. Strong.  The Solicitation will be soliciting for a Service Provider to provide Disaster Loss Verification services.  These services are currently provided by both CONUS AND OCONUS; only CONUS services are being competed.  Disaster Loss Verification deals with the verification of lossess to homes and businesses as a result of natural or man-made disasters.  Field activities go to these disaster areas to visit the site and assess physical damage. Presently, a survey is performed to determine the region where eligible applicants reside.

<DESC>This is an amendment to Fedbizopps synopsis RFQ-0H-04-00018 posted on November 5, 2003. After further consideration the U.S. EPA hereby issues this Sources Sought synopsis in search of small businesses, 8(a) firms, and small disadvantaged businesses to provide enhancements to a secure web-based system called E-Plan. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation of any submission to this Sources Sought Notice or to a purchase order for services. This is a market survey for written information only, to ascertain whether the services contemplated for this procurement can be set aside for small business concerns. The revised North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541511, the size standard of which is $21 million dollars. 

The EPA National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) is interested in supporting enhancements to E-Plan,  as a tool to assist emergency responders in preparing for emergency situations in buildings and water systems. Texas A&M performed initial development work on this product and the current E-Plan based platform was developed by the University of Texas at Dallas. The system will be modified to identify and assist in remediation of building and water vulnerabilities. E-Plan provides basic information that is helpful in protecting first responders and occupants of buildings and areas surrounding water systems in the event of a terrorist action in which chemicals and biologicals are used.  As part of the developments of this system under the anticipated purchase order, additional information and data will be inputted to further assist EPA personnel in responding to questions concerning evacuation and decontamination. For further information on E-plan, see: http://eplannews.utdallas.edu/eplan-advantage.htm and/or
http://www.utdallas.edu/~gupta/alps/Proj_Desc/Eplan.pdf  

NHSRC wants to enhance the current E-Plan tool to include an "expert system" that can assist  emergency responders in generating a "back-of-the-envelope" risk calculation and provide information to assist risk managers in deciding upon the appropriate means of clean-up. The contractor shall develop a technical plan which will outline how E-Plan could be enhanced to provide emergency responders with tools that will: (1) assist in conducting vulnerability assessments, and (2) provide risk-based information up to and including an expert system that will generate back-of-the-envelope risk calculations.   

The contractor shall enhance E-Plan by developing an easy to use floor plan mapping tool.  This tool would allow persons conducting an assessment to electronically "draw" the plan of each floor of the facility with standard "drag and click" icons that will identify the position of equipment/materials important to emergency responders (e.g., chemical storerooms, gas cut-off valves, HVAC system controls, etc.).  This tool shall also include a means to provide easy access to basic instructions concerning the operation of key systems (e.g., how to shut off the HVAC system).  These tools shall be adaptable to conducting vulnerability assessments of  water systems.

The contractor shall provide training in the use of the enhanced E-Plan tool to Agency personnel as well as first responders identified by the Agency.  The contractor shall develop written training materials, and provide at least two training sessions.

The contractor must have an in-depth knowledge of the requirements of emergency response personnel in order to be able to understand and make the needed software enhancements in a user-friendly manner.

Interested parties shall submit capability statements that demonstrate their experience in: 1.) modification of web based software developed by another party, 2.) designing software tools for emergency response personnel, and a knowledge of the type of information that is required by such personnel. 

The Stateuld be provided electronically to the Project Officer.  The prototype shall be tested by EPA personnel and first responders identified by EPA and revisions based on these tests shall be completed within 3 months of delivery to the Project Officer. 

Acceptance Criteria: The prototypes shall be technically accurate, clear, and complete, and meet specific requirements of this task. All software developed and system documentation shall be reviewed and evaluated against Agency guidelines and standards.

 
Task 3.0 Provide Training in the Use of Vulnerability Assessment Tools
   
In order to test the prototype, the contractor shall provide training in the use of this tool to Agency personnel as well as first responders identified by the Agency.  The contractor shall develop written training materials and shall provide 2 training sessions at a site specified by the EPA Project Officer.  This will require travel for a maximum of 2 contractor staff on 2 trips, to Cincinnati, Ohio and/or Washington, DC.  

Deliverables:  Written training materials that provide user friendly instructions and exercises on using the drawing tool.  In addition, the contractor shall conduct 2 half-day training sessions.

<DESC>E-PLAN ENHANCEMENTS FOR HOMELAND SECURITY

BACKGROUND

On September 24, 2002, the EPA Assistant Administrator for Research and Development established the National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC or Center) in order to support the Agency’s vital role in homeland security.  Specifically, the Center was created to manage and coordinate in the Office of Research and Development all homeland security research and technical assistance efforts, particularly in the areas of building safety, water security and rapid risk assessment.  The two primary goals of this Center are:
•	Conduct and facilitate the conduct of needed research and development methods or approaches to limit vulnerabilities in the nations water and building systems following purposeful introduction of hazardous agents.
•	Provide information, tools and support to the EPA regions and emergency response personnel to aid in the preparation for and response to a terrorist attack.

In support of these goals, the Center is searching for a means of sharing highly technical, risk-based information with emergency responders in support of their efforts in (1) prevention, (2) emergency preparedness, and (3) emergency response.  


SCOPE

The Center is interested in developing/supporting an electronic based system to assist emergency responders in preparing for emergency situations in buildings and water systems.  This system would be used to identify and assist in remediation of building and water system vulnerabilities. In addition, this tool will be able to provide basic information that will help protect first responders and occupants of these areas in the event of a terrorist action in which chemicals and biologicals are used.  As this tool evolves, additional information will be added to assist EPA’s on-scene coordinators and the emergency response team in responding to questions concerning evacuation and decontamination.  The goal is that the system will eventually include an “expert system” that can assist these emergency responders in generating a “back-of-the-envelope” risk calculation and can provide information to assist risk managers in deciding upon the appropriate means of clean-up.    


TASKS

Task 1.0 Develop a Project Plan for the Complete Risk Tool

The contractor will submit a technical plan for developing an electronic system that will provide emergency responders with tools that will: (1) assist in conducting vulnerability assessments and (2) provide risk-based information up to and including an expert system the will generate the back-of-the-envelope risk calculation.  The contractor shall indicate how this can be done using E-plan as a “backbone for the system” wherever it is technically feasible.   

Deliverables: A draft plan will be delivered to the Project Officer.  The information in the plan shall be presented in phases, clearly outlining what each phase shall do, its value to the emergency response community, and the cost of each phase.  

Acceptance Criteria: The draft shall be well-organized, technically accurate, clear and complete, and meet specific requirements of this task.  


Task 2.0 Develop Tools For Vulnerability Assessments

As a first step in developing vulnerability assessments, the contractor shall develop an easy to use floor plan mapping tool.  This tool shall allow persons conducting an assessment to electronically “draw” the plan of each floor of the facility and “drag and click” icons that shall identify the position of equipment/materials important to emergency responders (e.g., chemical storerooms, gas cut-off valves, HVAC system controls, etc.).  This tool should also include a means to provide easy access to basic instructions concerning the operation of key systems (e.g., how to shut off the HVAC system).  These tools should be adaptable to conducting vulnerability assessments of  water systems.

Deliverables:  A prototype with written descriptions of the drawing tool for buildings woment of Work is posted as Amendment 2 to this Fedbizopps announcement. 

Capability statements shall not exceed 5 pages and standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Reference RFQ-OH-04-00018. Again, this statement is for information purposes only. 

Interested parties shall submit their capabilities to the Contract Specialist no later than 15 days after the date of this announcement (by 5:00 PM Monday, January 22, 2004).

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River, MD is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies applicable to reduce heat stress associated with current anti-G suit and limit anti-G bladder expansion away from the pilot.  This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY: Current anti-G suits employ 1.7 oz polyurethane-coated nylon bladders, welded flat that inflate to round shapes. These bladders are encased in a sewn and bound 4.3oz aramid shell that is cut slightly smaller than the bladder shape to offload the bladder welds.  
The mechanism of protection is that of direct compression on the vascular tissue below the bladder as well as hoop compression around the body as the surrounding fabric casing tightens to in response to bladder inflation.
The anti-G suit is currently worn over the top of a flight coverall, dry suit, and undergarments.  In the past, the anti-G suit was worn over undergarments but underneath the dry suit and flight coverall. However, its inflation height (thus level of protection) was hampered by the size of the outer garments. Rather than increase the bulk of the outer garments to accommodate the anti-G suit, the anti-G suit was made flame resistant and moved to the outermost layer, and designed to reduce the bulk of the outer garments.  

DEFICIENCIES OF CURRENT BLADDER TECHNOLOGY:  
1) The anti-G suit bladders cover most of the surface area below the waist with impermeable bladders, which also increase thermal load.
2) The anti-G suit bladders are made of flammable, meltable materials, and must be encased within a flame resistant shell.
3) The “football” shape of anti-G suit bladders seem to apply inefficient point compression to tissue, and thus requires large inflated diameters to effect venous return.
4) The anti-G suit weighs up to 6 lbs, and impacts the overall aircrew physical workload.
5) The polyurethane coated nylon fabric is sticky on its coated face, and requires a spacer fabric to prevent kinking.
6) In the current anti-G suit design, if the bladder is damaged the entire suit must be disposed of because access to the bladders is very difficult and attempts to repair the bladder may result in additional damage.
7) The skill level to repair anti-G suits is high – inexperienced sewing machine operators can inadvertently “run over” the bladder, and ruin the asset. Thus no bladder repairs are allowed.
8) The bladder design requires die cutting and die-welding which have expensive initial set-up tooling costs.
9) The polyurethane coated nylon is relatively stiff for its weight, and restricts wearer mobility.
10) The polyurethane coated nylon is noisy when it is moved – a deficiency in a survival/evasion situation.
11) The compression of the coverall, dry suit, and undergarments underneath the anti-G suit restricts mobility, but also creates pressure points from folds 

The applicant must demonstrate the capability to:
1) Reduce the weight, thickness, and stiffness of bladder layer 
2) Employ a channel bladder system rather than the current football to distribute pressure more evenly around body, and to reduce the inflated profile overall
3) Incorporate traditional capstan in conjunction with bladder channels
4) Incorporate holes between bladders where possible to allow heat to escape and any external ventilation air to pass through the suit towards the skin

PROGRAM GOALS:
1) Demonstrate that new bladders can exert necessary vascular compression 
2) Demonstrate that inflated profile is reduced
3) Demonstrate that bladder inflation/deflation occurs as rapidly as current 
4) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is lighter and less bulky 
5) Demonstrate that an anti-G suit with new bladders is more “breathable” – allows more ventilation
6) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders provides commensurate G-protection in centrifuge
7) Demonstrate that the anti-G suit with new bladders reduces skin temperature and body core temperature of wearer compared to current
Note that demonstrations in centrifuge and on human subjects will be performed by NAWCAD.  
Note that demonstrations 1-3 shall include testing on human volunteers.

The Government is interested in the following criteria: (a) technical and scientific merit; (b) offer’s ability to demonstrate/execute feasibility; (c) offer’s existing capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of the above that will enable the vendor to achieve the intended objective; (d) ability to demonstrate and execute cost savings alternatives.  

The Government is interested in written submittals of concepts and rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates for the above. Companies responding to this request should provide detailed information on their capabilities and experience to DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY, NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND, AIRCRAFT SUPPORT CONTRACTS DEPARTMENT, ATTN: Jessica McGee, Code 2.5.1.3.2.7, 21983 Bundy Road Unit 7 Bldg 441, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127. Written responses should be submitted by 19 April 2004 and reference this synopsis number on both the mailing envelope as well as on all enclosed documents.  Interested companies should indicate whether or not they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), or large business.  Respondents must clarify if their firm can provide commercial or non-developmental items that could be modified, or the technology and expertise for development, to meet NAWCAD’s needs.  Please address all technical questions to Barry Shender, PhD., Code 4.6.4.1, (301) 342-8881.  Samples and 3-D models are encouraged.  Proprietary information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis.   
This announcement is NOT a Request For Proposal nor does the Government intend to pay for any information/items submitted in response to this synopsis.  Data, samples and 3-D models WILL NOT be returned.  This synopsis does not commit the Government to award a contract.  This synopsis is for market research only and any procurement resulting from this announcement will be published separately on the Federal Bunisess Opportunities website.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is establishing an eCommerce Manufacturer Direct Program for “Physician Preference” cardiovascular devices.  DSCP is seeking proposals from contractors interested in entering into a Firm-Fixed Price (with Economic Price Adjustment) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (s) to support the world wide demand for Manufacturer Direct products that fall into the following product line groups; Pacemakers, Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD’s), Heart Failure Devices and all necessary associated peripheral Cardiovascular Devices.  Offerors will be required to submit a catalog, detailing their entire product line that falls within these product line groups.  All products must be Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved.  We intend to award contracts to contractors who submit offerors that comply with the requirements of the solicitation.

This procurement applies to Government facilities worldwide.  Initially, offerors will be asked to supply CONUS catalog, which includes all facilities located in the 48 contiguous states as well as Alaska and Hawaii and will be implemented first.  The OCONUS catalog will include facilities located outside the continental United States and will be required in the future.  Each offerors product line will be loaded into the DSCP Medical Electronic Catalog (ECAT).  The catalog must reflect a total delivered price.  Total delivered price is defined as the total cost of an item inclusive of transportation and distribution costs.  

Physicians from the ordering facility will make a “Best Value” decision when selecting products.  This procurement contains an on-site personnel requirement for the contractor to provide advisory assistance to physicians before, during and after implantation of the devises.  All accessories and instruments (i.e. wrenches, adaptors, connectors, introducer kits, testing cables, etc.) necessary for implantation of the device shall be provided at no cost to the Government.   

All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Confirmation and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic.  Each vendor will be required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850-Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional Acknowledgement’s, send 855-Order Confirmation’s, and transmit 810-Invoice’s for payment.  There are (3) three communication options available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface, American National Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI Standards and the Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX).  Vendors must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options.  Vendors will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.

The subject solicitation is a standing solicitation that will remain in effect unless replaced by an updated solicitation.  Closing dates and time for receipt of proposals are hereby established as 3:00 P.M./EST on the last business day of every month.  Vendors can submit proposals any time prior to the closing date.  However, evaluation of all proposals received by the closing date will not be evaluated until the solicitation has closed.  Any resultant contract will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods.  This procurement has an estimated dollar value of $20 million dollars over the total contract period for all contracts combined.  Solicitation SP0200-04-R-5005 is expected to become available April 30, 2004 and can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.mil/home .

The scope of this contract includes all DLA managed items for which AM General is an approved source or that they have supplied in the past. Items within the scope may be added to the solicitation or any resulting contract(s) at a later date.  

This acquisition will result in Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite-Quantity Contracts for delivery to stock only.  The initial contract period will be two years with one three-year fixed-price option period.  The estimated two-year base period value is $12,008,947.54, totaling $30,022,268.85 with option.

2805	3040	4710	5905	5985	

Submission of solicitation pricing will be phased – approximately 100 NSNs every 30 days, prioritized by demand and whether or not the NSN is identified for Reset*.  Phased pricing will allow all vendors the opportunity to offer on as many NSNs as possible.  The Government may make multiple awards (maximum two for each NSN) by NSN where high-density items cannot be supported by a single source of supply.  However, this will ultimately be determined by the competition received.  An all or none clause is not included.  

For NSNs resulting in a single award, the managing activity will issue delivery orders by means of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), using the conventions and formats prescribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI X12) and the Department of Defense (DoD) Implementation Guidelines.  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will be using a Distribution Point with connections to several Value Added Networks (VANs) for passing transactions to vendors in ANSI X12 format.  Supplies will be ordered using the following EDI Transaction Sets:  

(1)	Transaction Set 850 – Call/Order
(2)	 Transaction Set 810 - Invoice

To determine the offeror(s) that provide the best value to the Government, the Agency will use the trade-off process (instead of the lowest priced technically acceptable source selection process).  

Access to a complete list of NSNs and P/Ns included on this solicitation can be downloaded from: http://www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/corporate_contracts/cc.asp on the date of issue.  It is impracticable to distribute the applicable drawings with the solicitation, however, they will be available at <http://dibbs.dscccols.com/rfp>.   If the drawings are not posted at this web site, see Clause L11D02Availability of Drawings for information on how to obtain the drawings.  FEDERAL, MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS CANNOT BE PROVIDED BY DSCC.

In order to receive drawings for this solicitation you must be JCP certified.  If you do not have a JCP certification number, go to the following web address and download the application, “Military Critical Technical Data Agreement” DD FORM 2345.

Fill out the form following all instructions and mail form to address shown in Battle Creek MI.

*Reset is a major effort to "repair and refit" Army and Marine Corps units that have recently returned from deployment. It involves bringing more than 20,000 wheeled and 3,000 tracked vehicles, every aviation system in Southwest Asia and 300 different command and control systems to a condition where they can be reissued for use by units replacing soldiers redeploying from Iraq or be used to fight another conflict anywhere in the world. The Marine Corps Reconstitution effort, while smaller in scale, is equally important.

<ARCHDATE>04012005
<CONTACT>Jane M. Carlson Contract Specialist 7037871364     Jane.Carlson@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award a contract for "Literature Search and Data Synthesis of Biological Information for use in Management Decisions Concerning Decommissioning of Offshore Oil and Gas Structures in the Gulf of Mexico."  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS 100% SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541710 -Biology research and development laboratories and services with a size standard of 500 employees.  BACKGROUND:  Presently, there are over 4,000 structures associated with oil and gas development and production in the state and Federal waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM).  These structures may provide suitable habitat for reef-dependent and reef-associated fishes in an area that has limited naturally occurring hard substrate.  Parker et al. (1983) estimate there are only about 2800 km2 of naturally occurring hard bottom between Brownsville, TX and Destin, Florida.  The oil and gas structures in the northern GOM provide about 12 km2, or about 0.4 percent of the natural reef area (LGL, 1998).  This number has remained steady over the past decade because new structure installations have roughly equaled the number of structures that are removed each year.  However, many of the oil fields of the GOM are reaching the end of their economic lives, and within the next ten years removals are expected to outpace installations. How will the removal of large numbers of oil and gas platforms affect the existing fish stocks and ecology of the GOM?  This is a very complex scientific question and one of the first steps should be a literature search and data synthesis of the large amount of scientific research that has been done on natural and artificial reefs in the GOM.  MMS has funded several studies to help analysts and managers better understand the ecological role of artificial reefs, and in particular, the role of oil and gas platforms in the northern GOM.  The focus of these studies has generally been on the small-scale, local effects and community structure of individual platforms.  Other Federal and state agencies, and universities have funded natural and artificial reef research in the GOM.  However, no efforts have been made to compile this research and use the information to assess the Gulf-wide ecological role of artificial reefs and how the GOMR's ecology might be impacted when the oil and gas platforms are removed.  To address this information need the MMS is conducting this study. OBJECTIVES:  The objectives of this project are to: 1) compile and review the available research on the biology and ecology of natural and artificial reefs in the Gulf of Mexico; 2) evaluate the Gulf-wide marine ecological impacts of the oil and gas structures located on the Gulf of Mexico OCS; 3) assess the Gulf-wide ecological consequences of removing the oil and gas structures from the GOM; and 4) identify information gaps for future studies. The performance period of this study shall be thirty (30) months and shall encompass all contracted tasks from initial planning, through, and including, MMS's final acceptance of all contract deliverables.  Cost of this study is estimated to be between $300,000 and $350,000. To Respond: In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statements by  4/22/04, detailing:  (1) Your key scientific and technical personnel, (those who would have the primary responsibility  for performing and/or managing the project) with their qualifications, specific expertise, and experience.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) has identified hydrogen as the fuel of the future.  It may be used in fuel cells or internal combustion engines and is traditionally stored as a high-pressure compressed gas or a cryogenic liquid.  Since the mid-1990’s, the demand for hydrogen produced at refineries has grown at a rate of 5% to 10% annually.  This demand is growing more rapidly as hydrogen finds a stronger position as a fuel in the transportation sector.  Hydrogen is used as a fuel additive to upgrade fuel quality and meet the stringent emissions specifications for gasoline and diesel or as a stand-alone fuel.

Steam reforming of natural gas is the preferred method for generating hydrogen.  Other production methods used to generate hydrogen have been declining since the mid-1990’s due to unfavorable economics.  In addition to production costs, the overall economics of hydrogen generation and use is impacted by the costs of compression, liquefaction, transportation, and storage. (NREL Report NREL/SR-540-32525).   The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has devised and modeled a novel alkaline metal-based hydrogen generation process that has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of compressing and liquefying hydrogen.  The INEEL has been investigating the energy requirements and products released in a controlled alkaline metal and water process.  The unique characteristic of an alkaline metal / water reaction is that the reaction will take place at elevated pressures.  At elevated pressures, the hydrogen gas may be dispensed directly into vehicles as a compressed fuel, or the stored energy of the compressed gas may be incorporated into pressure letdown processes to liquefy a portion or perhaps all of the hydrogen produced by the process.  The INEEL has identified a production process that can easily be varied to generate hydrogen at pressures specific to the application.  Other products resulting from this process are recycled in the closed loop process for continuous reuse and generation of hydrogen.

The INEEL is soliciting funding and development collaboration from qualified companies to support the technology development program and to test the proprietary process at pilot scale.  The project development period is expected to last 24-36 months.  At the conclusion of the development project, the firm may seek up to an exclusive field of use license for patented and patent pending intellectual property developed under this project.  This solicitation of interest will close on 5/31/2004

<CONTACT>See Description for Contact Information, See 'Description, Phone See Description, Fax See Description, Email See Description
<DESC>The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1998 (Perkins III) directs the Secretary of Education to conduct an "independent evaluation and assessment of vocational and technical education programs under this Act" (also known as the National Assessment of Vocational Education or NAVE) and appoint an independent advisory panel (IAP) to advise the Secretary on the implementation of the assessment.  The legislation also authorizes the IAP to submit its own report or statement to Congress.  Because of that objective, technical support services are needed to assist the IAP to edit, design, and layout the IAP report.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  The intended source, MPR Associates, Inc., 2150 Shattuck Ave., Suite 800, Berkeley, CA  94704, has worked on recent NAVE reports, including the NAVE Interim and Final reports.  The firm has developed past report files, formatting styles, logos, and electronic signatures of IAP members, thereby making the editing and formatting of the IAP report more time efficient.  Above all, the IAP report requires quick turnaround and needs to be completed within 14 days of the effective date of this purchase order.  In addition, all IAP members must approve the report within this period of time.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the posted response date will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For more information, contact Michael Fong at Michael.Fong@ed.gov.

<ARCHDATE>05182004
<CONTACT>Helene Braun, Contract Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email braunh@ninds.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is exploring the market interest and capabilities relating to the development of valid, reliable and domain specific tasks of Executive Functions for measurement and adequate intervention of executive dysfunction in neurological disorders.  NINDS is attempting to identify competent sources to establish and coordinate the research activities leading to new measurement approaches.

Background

Executive Function (EF) refers to a constellation of cognitive abilities that include the ability to plan, organize, and sequence tasks and manage multiple tasks simultaneously. Appropriate EF also includes components of self-monitoring and self-correcting behaviors. These important behaviors are compromised in healthy elders and in people with neurological, mental and age related disorders, leading to disruption of lifestyle and loss of independence. One obstacle for progressive research in this area of cognition is a paucity of valid and reliable tasks that specifically tap domains of EF. 

While some research has been ongoing with funding from NIH, the National Science Foundation and the McDonnell Foundation, it has been difficult to establish standard operational definitions of Executive Functions, resolve areas of controversies such as the design and validation of comprehensive neuropsychological tests to assess multiple domains of Executive Function in both basic and clinical research settings. This solicitation will take advantage of the state of our knowledge on research issues such as: neural pathways associated with executive function; appropriate animal models to study executive function; the nature, extent and rate of change of executive function in pathological states; the characterization – sparing or impairment - of executive function in neurodegenerative diseases; current tasks for assessment of executive function and the development of new tasks; factors that modulate executive function; and feasible behavioral and/or pharmacological interventions.  

The development of domain specific tasks of executive function as specified in this proposed  solicitation will be of considerable value to many of NINDS current  and future  research programs in neurological disorders where dysfunction in cognitive processes are integral components of functional outcomes and quality of life for affected patients. While there are numerous neuropsychological test batteries, their use has been maximized in research settings with little attention paid to adaptability to clinical trials. However, some aspects of “executive function” are being incorporated into many recent or current clinical trials in neurology, usually as secondary outcome measures.  Many neuropsychological assessment scales have been developed for use in various disease settings; however, some of the existing scales have questionable validity and there is no consensus on what methods should be used within or across studies or disease areas.  The lack of consensus about the best tools or approaches creates a situation where based on the existing literature, it is not possible to compare the relative burden of various neurological conditions to each other or more importantly, to compare the relative benefits of one treatment over another on the same patient-centered outcome. Supporting a research agenda that will create a battery of domain specific Executive Function tasks would greatly increase the probability for more precise clinical assessment and integration in a large range of basic brain research. 
 

Goals of the Proposed Initiative

The overall goal of this initiative would be to obtain a battery of tasks for EF that tap into its specific components that are comparable in animals and humans and the development of a battery of EF tasks with the specific characteristics such as: 

o	focused on one or more of the following six domains:  inhibition (response suppression); working memory (manipulation and maintenance of information; temporal organization (time & place); set shifting (mental flexibility); self monitoring (behavioral awareness, insight); abstraction (rules, categories).
o	modifiable (depending on individual protocols or paradigms and individual differences)
o	programmable; replicable (flexible across laboratories)
o	usable across species (rodents, monkeys, humans) and across age groups
o	adaptable for clinical trials
o	utilizes naturalistic situations (virtual reality)
o	includes functional outcomes (sensitive to treatment, training, drugs) 


Information Requested

Information in the following areas could aid in the design of a possible future solicitation.  We ask that interested organizations help identify critical criteria that would be germane to any such solicitation.

<DESC>The IRS has a requirement for on-site maintenance and repair services for nine (9)Multi-Functional Document Handling Systems (MDHS) at the nine (9) IRS Submission Processing Campuses (SPC) (formerly known as Service Centers).  There is one MDHS at each SPC.  The MDHS is a Bowe Bell & Howell (BB&H) Mail-Star 500 Inserter.  This inserter is used to cut, fold, insert, out-sort file or suspense copies, and sort finished mail pieces by weight.  These systems are used in the main stream processing of tax returns and related taxpayer correspondence, thereby making their scheduled operation critical to the overall continued tax processing flow within each IRS SPC's daily outgoing mail.  These machines are 15 years old and were reconditioned during FY2003.  This requirement is for: (1) one (1) contractor field Customer Service Engineer (CSE) at each of the 9 IRS SPCs for an eight hour shift.  Hours will depend on the site requirement.  There is potential for additional, on-call maintenance services for these locatons; (2) three (3) dedicated support engineers located at the contractor's plant; (3) other plant support personnel with proprietary expertise on all MDHS software, firmware, and hardware, plus other MDHS maintenance support services; and (4) MDHS "equivalent" test system and special field support at the contractor's plant.

<CONTACT>Jennifer Arber, Contract Specialist, (973)724-4113
<DESC>The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Armament, Research, Development, Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources to provide technical expertise and support to continue the development of the XM1 railgun launcher as part of a Government and Contractor Integrated Product Team (IPT) working on the Electromagnetic (EM) Gun Technology Maturation and Demonstration Program.  The XM1 is a 38mm by 76mm x4m rectangular bore railgun launcher currently in development by the Army.  The offeror will be required to complete the design of the XM1, fabricate components, assemble the launcher, and ready it for test firing.  Minimal alterations of the current XM1 design may be desired to incorporate lessons learned on recent subscale testing of technologies relevant to XM1 service life.  Detailed numerical Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of XM1 operation that solve the electromagnetic differential equations will be required to clearly define the operating environment for the XM1 launcher including rail heating, current diffusion, Lorenz forces, etc. In a parallel IPT effort, Experimental Simulation Machines (ESMs) are under development that replicate important aspects of the XM1 operating enviornment for the purposes of swift, inexpensive, and flexible testing of candidate bore protection technologies.  FEA of the ESMs will be required of the offeror to parametrically maximize the ability of the ESMs to mimic pertinent aspects of the XM1 operating environment to the degree practicable. Due to advancement of EM launcher technology fostered under this program in FY04 and FY05, incremental changes of the XM1 launcher design will be undertaken to extend the state of the art in EM launcher technology.  Spiral development of the XM1 will lead to the XM1A1 anticipated for fabrication and firing nominally one year after the XM1.  To this end, the offeror will be required to collaborate with the IPT and related program efforts being fostered by other elements of the Department of Defense to design and conduct FEA of the XM1A1 launcher and related ESMs.  Fabrication of the XM1A1 will be conducted by other elements of the IPT and will not be required by the offeror. Any interested parties for this launcher support effort must submit clear and concise information that will show a superior understanding of applied railgun armament engineering, fabrication, assembly, and testing.  This can be demonstrated in the form of patents, publications, preliminary designs, detailed designs, and test data for state of the art railgun launchers.  This information should be included with any submission. This information is to be provided via email to jarber@pica.army.mil or pnickel@pica.army.mil, and received by 16 April 2004.  Brochures may be mailed to Jennifer Arber, Contract Specialist, or Patricia Nickells, Contracting Officer, US Army TACOM ARDEC, AMSTA-AQ-APE, B. 10, Picatinny Arsenal , NJ 07806-5000.  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and the Government will not reimburse the cost incurred by providing this information.  See Numbered Note 25.

<SUBJECT>A--Advanced Railgun Launcher Concepts
<SOLNBR>W15QKN-04-X-0510
<RESPDATE>041604
<CONTACT>Lisa King, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3198
<DESC>The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Armament, Research,  Development, and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is conducting a  Market Survey to identify potential sources to provide technical expertise and  support to the design of long safe-service-life railgun launchers as part of a  Government and Contractor Integrated Product Team (IPT) working on the  Electromagnetic (EM) Gun Technology Maturation and Demonstration Program.  The  actual design, build, and test of a complete electromagnetic launcher is not  included in this request.  Sources will be required to fabricate a short  section of a launcher, here after referred to as a stub tube, for hardware  validation of several aspects of the design approach.  The normal size of the  stub tube is anticipated to be 60cm long with a 30 square cm bore are. The current Army effort is to focus upon a multipurpose 2MJ muzzle-energy class  launcher with an objective bore life of 200 rounds.  Other elements of the IPT  will be conducting the design, fabrication, and testing of a complete launcher  system.  Due to fiscal and schedule constraints, it is not feasible to consider  a wide variety of launcher design concepts for full scale testing.  However, it  is the intent of the current program to foster innovation and generate design  concepts that would prove viable for possible future programs.  To this end,  advanced railgun launcher concepts are sought that are worthy of near-term seed- money support.  These concepts should promote technology that if selected for  future programs, could achieve credible service life for mature weapon  demonstrators, while proving sufficiently lightweight and structurally robust  for muzzle pointing stabilization. Any interested parties for this launcher support effort must submit clear and  concise information that will show a superior understanding of fundamental and  applied research in armament engineering, electromagnetic railguns, and  structural design for producibility.  For the purposes of this program effort,  transition is considered an armature failure mode of operation.  Subsequently,  service life and barrel structure technology will focus upon a nonarcing  contact mode throughout launch.  Technologies to ameliorate the effects of  repeated armature transition on bore life are not sought.  In addition,  capabilities sought must include an extensive body of knowledge and experience  with prototype design and fabrication for railgun launchers.  This can be  demonstrated in the form of patents, publications, preliminary designs,  detailed designs, and test data for state of the art railgun launchers.  This  information should be included with any submission. This information is to be provided via email to Lking@pica.army.mil or  Pnickel@pica.army.mil, and received by 16 April 2004.  Brochures may be mailed  to Lisa King, Contract Specialist, or Patricia Nickells, Contracting Officer,  US Army TACOM-ARDEC, AMSTA-AQ-APE, B.10, Picatinny Arsenal Nj 07806-5000.  This  market survey is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be  construed as a commitment by the Government.

<ARCHDATE>07162004
<CONTACT>Timothy F. Boyd, 916-557-5226
<DESC>Sources Sought/Notice of Intent to Negotiate with One Source.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with MWH Americas, Inc., the designer for the Fort Irwin Waste Water Treatment Plant  (WWTP) Tertiary Upgrade to perform Construction Phase, formerly known as Title II services and design changes during construction.  Services include review of shop drawings, value engineering review, responding to contractors questions associated with the  design, specialty inspections, startup assistance, operator training, preparation of operator manual, and design changes.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with MWH Americas, Inc. under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, unless, as a result of an analysis of acceptable responses to this notice, a determination is made by the Government to issue a competitive solicitation.  The Sacramento District Corps of Engineers (The Corps) is seeking to identify sources that are uniquely qualified to perform the services described above. The Fort Irwin WWTP was originally constructed in 1955.  Subsequently, a number of improvements have been undertaken and the plant capacity has been increased to an average of 2.0 mgd.  Currently, the plant provides secondary treatment of the influent wast ewater utilizing the following unit processes: headworks, oxidation ditch, two secondary clarifiers, chlorine contact tank, effluent ponds, and sludge drying beds.  The treated secondary effluent is discharged to a holding pond and from there, it is pumped  and sprayed on an abandoned golf course to promote evaporation.  Excess irrigation water, in the form of runoff, is conveyed to a number of ponds where it is percolated to the groundwater.  The current waste discharge permit allows for secondary effluent reuse under restricted access conditions.   MWH Americas, Inc. (formerly known as Montgomery Watson Americas, Inc) performed the effluent disposal study in 1998, evaluated the existing WWTP system and found it to have significant shortcomings.  To alleviate the existing deficiencies and promote grea ter water conservation through reuse, MWH Americas, Inc., designed the tertiary treatment facilities and distribution system during years 2000 and 2003 to meet the State Title 22 requirements for unrestricted access use, which would result in greater efflu ent reclamation.  MWH Americas, Inc. performed design modifications on the design package to accommodate a major equipment substitution proposed at the time of bid.  MWH Americas, Inc. was also the designer for numerous additions/upgrades to WWTP such as t he original secondary plant, pretreatment facility, and aeration system.   The Tertiary Upgrade project involves tie-in and modifications to many existing facilities at the WWTP and will require a thorough understanding of the existing facilities and condi tions.  MWH Americas, Inc. has invested many hours in studying the existing WWTP system, coordinating with regulatory agency for their approval of upgrading the WWTP to reclaim use of wastewater.   The study of the existing WWTP system, the design for several improvements to the WWTP over the last 10 years at Fort Irwin, thorough knowledge of existing facilities and condition, involvement in regulatory approval and coordination, provides MWH Americas , Inc. with the unique knowledge and qualifications to provide and ensure smooth execution of Construction Phase services for the construction of the tertiary upgrade.  There are no Government-owned drawings or technical literature for the services described herein.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  Information furnished as a minimum should include appropriate t echnical information and professional qualifications that demonstrates the firmÃ¢Â€Â™s ability to meet the minimum requiremen ts listed above.  Responses should be limited to a maximum of 10 pages, total.  Oral or facsimile responses will not be accepted.  Responses should be sent to:  Barbara Marshall, Attn:  CESKPK-CT, 1325 J Street, Sacramento, CA  95814-2922.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed co ntract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If the Government determines, based on the responses to this notice, that a full and open competition will be conducted, a synopsis will be placed in FedBizOpps announcing the acquisition; otherwise, the Government will proceed with negotiations with one source with no further notice.

<SUBJECT>R -- Multifamily Housing Rental Assistance Contract Administration for Programs Other Than Section 8
<DESC>This public announcement is being issued as required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (Revised May 29, 2003).  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announces that it intends to conduct an A-76 Standard Competition to determine whether or not the work described in support of the HUD Non-Section 8 Multi-Family Housing Contract Administration will be performed by the Federal Government or by a private sector or other non-federal source.   Due to the complexity of the activity, the projected end date is 18 months from posted date. 

Currently, an estimated 60-80 full time equivalents at locations throughout the United States are performing the activity.  Our understanding is that there currently are no incumbent service providers performing the program monitoring functions anticipated to be covered by this competition.  It should be noted that GAO and HUD’s Office of Inspector General have stated that this activity is not adequately being performed.

The purpose of this study is to determine the most efficient and cost-effective means for providing the required services.  This will be accomplished by conducting a cost comparison between the Government’s Most Efficient Organization and a non-federal source.  Please note that a contract may or may not ultimately be awarded as a result of this competition.  Further announcements concerning this effort will be forthcoming.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is De Ritchie, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, the Contracting Officer is Catherine Haddon, and the Agency Tender Official is J. Patrick Goray.

<SUBJECT>79 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  The following items have been identified: Ecolab Quick Click Dilution System. NSNs 7930-00-NIB-0354, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC 31, Floor Cleaner; 7930-00-NIB-0355, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC 33, Floor Finish Restorer; 7930-00-NIB-0356, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC 51, General Purpose Cleaner; 7930-00-NIB-0357, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC 52, Glass Cleaner; 7930-00-NIB-0358, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC 53, Multi-Purpose Degreaser; 7930-00-NIB-0359, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC 71, Odor Counteractant; 7930-00-NIB-0360, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC 98, Non-Acid Bathroom Cleaner; 7930-00-NIB-0361, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC Central Supply Dispenser; 7930-00-NIB-0362, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC Satellite Spray Bottle Dispenser; 7930-00-NIB-0363, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC Omega Disinfectant; 7930-00-NIB-0462, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC 91 Acid Bath Cleaner; 7930-00-NIB-0463, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC A-456-N Neutral Detergent/Disinfectant; 7930-00-NIB-0464, SKILCRAFT® Ecolab QC Satellite Mop Bucket Dispenser.  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm’s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>A -- WALRUS (Heavy Lift Air Vehicle) Program Industry Day
<DESC>This is a WALRUS (Heavy Lift Air Vehicle) Industry Day Announcement by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The WALRUS program is a design and development effort where the primary objective is to demonstrate the feasibility and viability of a large lifting air vehicle able to transport a Unit of Action (UA) from 'Fort to Fight'. The WALRUS air vehicle(s) will be capable of inter-and intra-theater operations and will deploy the UA as a complete integrated package of personnel and equipment, ready to fight. It is anticipated that the objective operational air vehicle will be capable of lifting 500 tons or more across intercontinental distances and will be capable of operating from unimproved landing sites. The WALRUS air vehicle will also be suitable for a range of other missions requiring large platform and long endurance/range. Further Industry Day information has been posted on the DARPA website (http://www.darpa.mil) under TTO.  Future revisions and further information will also be posted there.  Searching for "WALRUS" will return all pertinent information released for Industry Day and the program.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-20.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible parties may submit a quote.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Neutron Spectrometer to be used by the NIST/Ionizing Radiation Division.

NIST provides calibration fields for reference neutron dosimetry.  This includes fields for the calibration of health physics monitors, for the evaluation of nuclear industry detectors and techniques, and, more recently, to resolve questions related to the location of Special Nuclear Material for Homeland Security (DHS).  Neutron spectra for the NIST reference fields have been determined mostly by using well-documented sources and by calculation.  Confirming measurements made by NIST were limited to low-resolution reaction rates such as could be measured by fission detectors.

This inability to directly measure neutron spectra was not limited to NIST, but represented the state of the art.  The determination of any of these spectra was a major effort, requiring dedicated effort by specialists over months and years.  The continuing improvement of modern electronics systems has provided a means to integrate and automate neutron spectroscopy to become less time and labor intensive. 

NIST fields range from thermal neutron energy (0.025 eV) to above 14 MeV. These include fission-based sources (e.g. Cf-252) and 14 MeV fields, as well as gamma,n and alpha,n sources. Some of the fields include these sources with various moderators surrounding the source, such as heavy water or iron. The requirement is to measure these fields with a consistent, accurate spectrometer with sufficient energy resolution to resolve major structure in the spectra.

The spectrometer will be used to validate NIST reference fields. It will be used to evaluate the effects of scattering material on these fields.  Portability will give NIST the ability to do field measurements.

All interested parties shall provide a quote for the following line items:  

LINE ITEM 0001:  Quantity one (1) each Neutron Spectrometer meeting all of the following required specifications:  

(1)Complete coverage of the neutron spectrum from thermal energy to 16 MeV. No initial knowledge of the neutron spectrum is required to determine a neutron spectrum;

(2)Ability to measure the neutron spectrum with a resolution of 20% or better (less) above 100 keV. The total fluence derived from the spectrum needs to be within 20% of the true value, and the kerma and dose-equivalent within 15%;

(3)Stability in time and environment.  Calibration interval needs to be at least six months. The system will be capable of being transported off-site and used to make spectral measurements without the use of a calibration source. Outdoor operation is expected. Operating temperatures will range from approximately 40 degrees F to about 90 degrees F, with relative humidity from about 10% to 85%;

(4)Self-contained system with all detectors, electronics, cabling, laptop controller, and software to provide neutron spectrum, neutron dose (H*(10)), and dose rate with no additional components or software. Spectrum shall be available within 30 minutes of the completion of data acquisition;

(5)Compact.  NIST neutron sources are typically in shielded rooms. Field measurements are to be made to determine neutron environments in a volume as small as a suitcase and, more typically, in a volume of human dimensions. All detector components need to operate simultaneously within a 30-inch diameter x 24 inch high volume without interference. If necessary to measure a smaller volume, each detector will be separable from the remainder of the system by a distance of at least 20 feet and operated independently;

(6)Controlling computer must be connected by cable to the detector systems with an available separation distance of at least 25 feet, allowing the operator to control the detectors while outside the radiation fields;

(7)Gamma ray rejection of at least 10:1;

(8)The spectrometer shall be capable of measuring spectra in fields of at least 50 mrem per hour;

(9)The Contractor shall provide operating manuals describing principles and theory of operation, troubleshooting diagnostics, and data acquisition & analysis;

(10)The Contractor shall certify that the spectrometer has the capability to be used with and not be damaged by neutron radiation.

LINE ITEM 0002 - OPTION LINE ITEM: Training: The Contractor shall schedule and facilitate a training session for three (3) NIST personnel, on-site at NIST Gaithersburg.  The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, equipment operation and basic troubleshooting.  

The Contractor shall state the warranty coverage provided for this equipment.  At a minimum, the warranty shall cover all parts, labor and travel for a period of one year following acceptance by the Government.   Coverage shall include any problem/damage incurred by neutron radiation.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination and shall be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial delivery schedule.  

FOB Destination means the contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

Award will be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor: Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement, 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are equal to price.

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quoters shall include the manufacturer, make and model of the product, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated herein.  Training shall be evaluated as a part of Technical Capability.

The Contractor must certify that the primary function of the detector will not be damaged by neutron radiation for a period of one year.  NIST may require the detector be tested in a neutron beam at the NIST Center for Neutron Research with a beam provided by NIST.

Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service provided.  Evaluation of Past Performance will be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or the offeror’s recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates.  Offerors shall provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed.

The following provisions apply to this acquisition: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; and 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.

The following clauses apply to this acquisition:  52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items;  52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items including subparagraphs: (1) 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government, with Alternate I; (2) 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns (if the offeror elects to waive the preference, it shall so indicate in its’ offer); (8) 52.219-23, Notice of Price Evaluation Adjustment for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (if the offeror elects to waive the preference, it shall so indicate in its’ offer); (11) 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; (12) 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; (13) 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; (14) 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; (15) 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; (16) 52.222-19 Child Labor – Cooperation With Authorities And Remedies; (23) 52.225-5, Trade Agreements; (24) 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases (E.O. 12722, 12724, 13059, 13067, 13121, and 13129; and (29) 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Central Contractor Registration; 52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity – Separately Price Line Items; Department of Commerce Agency-Level Protest Procedures Level  above the Contracting Officer is also incorporated.

52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items.
Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
1. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For this solicitation the evaluation process will be in two steps.  The following factors will be used in the first step of the evaluation process.  They are listed in descending order of importance:
PAST PERFORMANCE –Submit three (3) relevant and recent references complete with working phone numbers and email addresses, points of contact, contract description, contract value, period of performance and state any problems, if any, and how they were resolved.  

If past performance information cannot be verified, past performance will receive a neutral rating. 
PRICE
TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO MEETS THE GOVERNMENT’S REQUIREMENT – the Government will evaluate the offeror’s detailed manufacturing plan, quality assurance plan, composition of the grade of metal used, and the sources of fiber, fabric and place of manufacture for the ribbons.  The most important subfactor under technical is the detailed manufacturing plan and then the quality assurance plan..
2.	After the offers have been evaluated according to paragraph (a) 1, the contracting officer will make a “competitive range” determination.  Those within the competitive range will be requested to send a Product Demonstration Model (PDM) for those decorations that the offeror has a reasonable chance of an award.  The PDM will be evaluated for adherence to specifications and for workmanship.

3.	The PDM will then be the standard for which all supplies under the contract will be judged as being acceptable or not.  The PDM may have minor defects, which the offer can agree to correct and certify that the minor defects will not be in the decorations that will be delivered under the contract.
.For the second phase of evaluation the following factors are listed in order of impotance:
1) PDM
2) Past Performance
3) Price
4) Technical
___________________________
 4. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
5. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>THIS ACQUISITION IS HEREBY CANCELED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

STATEMENT OF WORK 
Contractor support for Logo Development and Branding


	I.	BACKGROUND

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), located in Washington, D.C., is one of the world's leading statistical agencies. Although it is a relatively small agency, BEA produces some of the most closely watched economic statistics that influence the decisions made by government officials, business people, households, and individuals. BEA's economic statistics, which provide a comprehensive, up-to-date picture of the U.S. economy, are key ingredients in critical decisions affecting monetary policy, tax and budget projections, and business investment plans. 

The cornerstone of BEA's statistics is the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), which feature the estimates of a gross domestic product (GDP) and related measures. The GDP was recognized by the Department of Commerce as its greatest achievement of the 20th century and has been ranked as one of the three most influential measures that affect U.S. financial markets. Since the NIPAs were first published, BEA has developed and extended its estimates to cover a wide range of economic activities. Today, BEA prepares national, regional, industry, and international accounts that present essential information on such key issues as economic growth, regional economic development, inter-industry relationships, and the nations’ position in the world economy. 
				
	II.	PURPOSE

	The purpose of this procurement is to contract for the development and implementation of a logo and branding plan for the agency to help increase its profile between public data users and create a consistent image for the organization.
