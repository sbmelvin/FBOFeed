<DESC>The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) intends to award on a sole source basis,  a purchase order to CLRC, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory of Chilton, Didcot, United Kingdom for the following item: One (1) each Mixer Block at 200MHz; one (1) each Mixer Block at 300MHz and one (1) each Mixer Block at 650MHz.  The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) requires the use of these Mixer Blocks inside the cryostat located within the antennas’ array. These mixer blocks are super conducting high frequency mixer blocks incorporating electroformed scalar feed design made to high degree mechanical tolerance, typically +/- 2.5 microns, cooled to cryogenic temperatures (4.2k).  We currently use these mixer blocks for the SMA receivers and the additional blocks are needed as spares to upgrade the performance of the receivers. These mixer blocks are being rotated from the SAO, SMA site at the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii to the SAO, SMA site in Cambridge, Massachusetts to enable the upgrades and repairs more efficiently. CLRC, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory is the manufacturer of the mixer blocks, in operation at the SMA site in Hawaii. Additionally, the SMA lab tooling is set-up around the tolerances of these Rutherford mixer blocks.  A determination by SAO not to complete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of SAO. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Delivery is ninety (90) days ARO.  This acquisition is being conducted under the guidelines as set forth in the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). No written solicitation will be issued for this requirement.  Anticipated award date is November 1, 2005

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a one year cost reimbursement contract with four option years entitled State Outcome Measurement and Management System (SOMMS) Central Services.  The goal of this project is to implement and manage the State Outcomes Measurement and Management System (SOMMS) to receive from Federal data bases, other contractors, and on occasion, directly from State Agencies,  data on SAMHSA’s National Outcomes Measurement (NOMS) domains for substance abuse prevention and treatment and mental health prevention and treatment.  The information developed will be used for the purposes of seeking improvements in treatment and prevention outcomes as well as to facilitate policy decision-making at national and State levels.  The contract includes tasks to result in standardized definitions and measures for NOMS, technology and statistical methods to match pre- and –post service records and match records for the same individual across service providers, develop performance management reports and benchmarking strategies.  The contract requires close coordination with other Federal contractors, other Federal agencies, and knowledge of performance management issues at the provider, State, Federal project Officer, and federal senior executive levels. In addition, a significant element of this contract is on-site assessment of the data collection and management and related information technology platforms in State agencies and development of plans for up-grades that are required for a State to meet the performance requirements of SAMHSA to participate in the SOMMS program.  This will require specialized systems integration, hardware, and software expertise and the ability to closely coordinate with evaluators, health services researchers, and negotiate between State agencies.   The focus of this procurement will be to:  Convening Experts:  Assist SAMHSA in identifying researchers, practitioners, and research methodologists in substance abuse prevention and treatment to develop and standardize National Outcome Measures for all programs in substance abuse prevention, treatment, and mental health.  Data Collection and Preparation:  Provide SAMHSA with a full range of support in receiving, editing, storing, and sharing National Outcomes data from States, territories, and grantees using an integrated relational database for program monitoring, evaluation, and analysis.   Assistance to States:  Provide technical assistance to States and Territories in developing State data infrastructure and determining requirements and planning improvements to State information technology to collect, clean, and submit to SAMHSA unduplicated client level National Outcome Measures from administrative records.  Analytic support:  Provide SAMHSA with a full range of analytic support including the preparation of analytic data files using SAMHSA databases, NIDA Clinical Trial data, and other Federal/Non Federal databases.  The support should also include statistical programming, statistical analysis, literature searches, technical writing and editing of written products, developing presentation materials, and consultation on statistical and analytic methods such as regression analyses, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), variance estimation and other statistical and methodological tools.  Logistics Support:  Provide travel, lodging and meeting support for experts convened to design analytic plans for analysis of policy issues or develop operational measures for select  NOMS domains.  Certain of the tasks will require senior systems analysts, while others will require senior health services analysts and statisticians with knowledge of the mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention services continuum.   The estimated date for issuance of this RFP is May 12, 2005 with proposal responses due June 13, 2005.  This solicitation may be obtained in any of four ways; by mail; picked up in person at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1051, Rockville, MD 20852; FedBizOps, or, electronically at the SAMHSA web site: http:/samhsa.gov/contracts.

<DESC>The VisiBuilding program is soliciting proposals due 4 January 2006 (initial selection). Point of Contact (POC): Dr. Edward J. Baranoski, Program Manager, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Special Projects Office (SPO), 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714; facsimile: 703-524-2449; e-mail: visibuilding@darpa.mil (e-mail contact preferred). Objective: In support of the VisiBuilding program, DARPA/SPO is soliciting proposals from qualified corporations, research institutions, universities, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and Department of Energy (DoE) laboratories under BAA06-04.   The goal of the VisiBuilding program is to develop knowledge-deriving architectures for sensing people and objects in buildings.  The program will address propagation and backscatter off urban structures, develop operational concepts for sensor position and utilization, and derive model-driven algorithms that best match hypothesized structural models with the actual sensed data.  A key component of VisiBuilding will be how to make the technology operationally useful to support all stand-off sense-through-buildings concepts of operations (CONOPS), ranging from pre-mission planning to find which buildings should be searched, through detailed assessment of targeted structures for building layouts and behavioral analysis, live updates of building occupancy to support building raids, and finally post-mission analysis to find hidden objects or people.  Sensor and exploitation architectures must provide:  1) a detailed understanding of the building structure to provide actionable information on building layouts, and provide reasonable floor plans of the structure, 2) detection and localization of anomalous quantities of materials within the building structure, and 3) detection and localization of people within a building.  In order to be effective, VisiBuilding must demonstrate penetration and interpretation through at least two exterior-grade walls using standard building construction materials such as reinforced concrete, concrete block, brick, adobe, etc.  Concrete and concrete block should be at least eight inches (20 cm) in thickness.  Sensor architectures must be able to resolve wall positions to within 0.5 meters laterally and ceiling and floor locations within 0.5 meters vertically, with a 95 percent probability of correct localization.  Similarly, they must be able to detect and localize non-structure related materials larger than 3 square meters in size beyond two walls.  They must also be able to detect, resolve, and locate moving personnel within 0.5 meters with a 99 percent probability of detection and 1 percent false alarm rate with a minimum detectable velocity of 0.5 meters/second.  Sensor architectures should permit close-range stand-off from the building to be examined. Stand-off distances should at least be 10 meters, or on the order of street-level access or from neighboring structures. Ideally, sensor configurations should allow for discrete (perhaps covert) examination of the building structure through some combination of any or all of the following: small distributed hand-held or emplaced sensors, vehicle-borne sensors, and/or airborne or perching sensors.  Sensor architectures will be an important facet of this development, but the key technology advances are expected in the areas of phenomenology, sensor architectures, and exploitation and model-based reconstruction algorithms.  These three areas are tightly coupled, and the interdependencies between them should be represented in the proposals program and management plan. The program will be a multi-phase effort, with each phase constructed to advance the technology towards a full demonstration of capability.  Phase I will be a twelve-month Concept Development and Evaluation effort to develop conceptual ideas in one or more sensor modes and configurations.  The proposed architecture will be simulated and analyzed to show concept realism for penetrating deep within standard buildings. This will lead into a concept design review.  The result of this phase will be concept design(s) and the estimated performance for the Phase II Sensor Demonstration System(s), and an updated execution plan and cost for the Phase II prototype design, development, and demonstration effort.  The following descriptions of Phase II and III activities are notional. Any and all aspects of these phases are subject to change pending the outcome of Phase I (and Phase II results for Phase III).  Selected performers may continue with Phase II, an eighteen month Sensor Demonstration System phase to develop the sensor and exploitation architecture and demonstrate its capability on two-story structures.  This phase will require developing a full sensor system and exploitation architecture meeting design objectives on selected building structures. Based upon the Phase II demonstration results and an updated form-fit prototype description, selected performers may continue Phase III for a fifteen month Advanced Prototype Development effort to develop a full prototype system that can sense and accurately model multi-story structures, including all necessary sensor communication and on-line processing. DARPA is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the full program.  One or more awards are anticipated.  Contractors are expected to develop full system architectures that address principal technical challenges in propagation phenomenology, sensor architecture configuration and concepts of operation, and model-based algorithms and processing architectures for reconstructing full building models from the sensed data.  The contractor will have to address expected performance and develop an early proof-of-concept demonstration in Phase I that will directly address architectural issues to be tackled in Phases II and III. The contractor will also identify critical technology developments required to enable the system concept. A Proposers Day Briefing will be held on 14 November 2005 to present the goals and structure of the VisiBuilding program to potential proposers.   One-on-one meetings with the DARPA Program Manager and other members of the VisiBuilding Government Team will be available as well.   This program will unclassified, although specific proposals incorporating classified technologies are also acceptable.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: Proposers must obtain the BAA06-04 Proposers Information Packet (PIP) which provides further technical and administrative detail for this BAA including the technologies of interest, evaluation criteria, funding processes, and format of proposals. Proposals not meeting the specified format described in the PIP may not be considered for award. The PIP is not classified and may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website. A table of important dates and milestones is provided in the PIP. These include a Proposers Day Briefing to be held 14 November 2005 at Booz Allen Hamilton, Newman Auditorium at 8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean, VA 22102.  Contact visibuilding@darpa.mil to attend the Proposers Day Briefing.   The VisiBuilding program may include information controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR 120-130, therefore contractors may be required to protect information pursuant to ITAR and are encouraged to consider this when proposing. Questions regarding this BAA or comments on the PIP may be e-mailed directly to visibuilding@darpa.mil.  It is anticipated that contracts will be awarded on or about 15 March 2006.   The Government will not be liable for the cost of proposal preparation and submission. Proposals must be submitted in accordance with this announcement and the PIP. There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement. Proposers should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published on the FedBizOpps website. ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Each cost proposal shall contain a section satisfying the following requirements: awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR, subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All Proposers and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the Proposer supports and identify the prime contract number(s). Affirmations shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission and the existence or potential existence of organization conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Proposer has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. If the Proposer believes that no such conflict exists, then it shall so state in the section. It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. The Government intends to use non-Government personnel as special resources to assist with the logistics of administering the proposal evaluation and providing selected technical assistance related to proposal evaluation. These support personnel are restricted by their contracts from disclosing proposal information for any purpose and are required to sign Organizational Conflict of Interest Non-Disclosure Agreements. By submission of its proposal, each Proposer agrees that proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above. Any information not intended for limited release to support contractors must be clearly marked and segregated from other submitted proposal material. Points of Contact: Dr. Edward J. Baranoski, DARPA/SPO Program Manager, e-mail: visibuilding@darpa.mil. Contractual POC: Jennifer Schoen, Contracting Officer, DARPA/CMO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203-1714.  This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instruction provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time while the BAA remains open.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, proposals must be received by DARPA on or before 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, 4 January 2006. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that will be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs),  Minority Institutions (MIs) and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a cooperative agreement, procurement contract, technology investment agreement, other transaction for prototype agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are, in order of importance: (a) Scientific and Technical Merit; (b) Proposer Qualifications; and (c) Cost Realism.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the parts of a proposal from proposal respondents.  Proposals may be selected and/or award decisions made without discussions or negotiations.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT DARPA BAA#06-06: Nano Air Vehicle Program. POCs: Dr. Darryll J. Pines (DARPA/DSO), FAX 703/696-8401; Ms. Algeria Tate (DARPA/CMO), FAX: 703/248-8033. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative proposals for the research and development of very small (<7.5cm), very lightweight (<10 grams) UAVs (nano air vehicles). The goal of this program is to prove the feasibility and viability of UAV on this extremely small scale. Such a capability would provide the military services with a highly effective tool for the collection of battlefield intelligence. To facilitate the transfer of program information to potential bidders, an Industry Day was held on Thursday, September 29, 2005, 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM at the Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA  22201.  Briefings were provided and Government requirements including potential customers were defined. Interested organizations can view this information at http://teaming.sysplan.com/NAV/.  In order to insure that all technically relevant DoD Nano Air Vehicle requirements are fully addressed, teaming of companies, Government laboratories and academic institutions with complementary areas of expertise or core competence is encouraged. A teaming website is provided to facilitate these interactions and can be found at http://teaming.sysplan.com/NAV/.  The deadline for receipt of full proposals for evaluation will be 3:00 P.M., local time, Monday, December 12, 2005. All proposals received by the appropriate due date and found to be in full compliance with the response requirements specified in this solicitation and the Proposer Information Pamphlet will be evaluated. The following evaluation criteria are listed in decreasing order of importance.  Proposals that are deemed unsatisfactory in Scientific and Technical Merit will not be evaluated further.  Scientific and Technical Merit:  Proposers must demonstrate that their proposal is innovative and unique, that the technical approach is sound, that they have an understanding of critical technical issues and risk, and that they have a plan for mitigation of those risks. A significant improvement in capability or understanding above the state of the art must be demonstrated. All milestones must be clearly and quantitatively described.  Value to Defense:  Proposers must demonstrate the potential of successful research to radically change the capability of extremely small scale UAVs for the military.  A discussion of the state of the art and how this program will dramatically improve it must be included. A critical part of this evaluation criterion is the approach used to ensure a clear transition path from the research phase of this effort to the use of this technology by the military.  Capability of the Personnel and Facilities to Perform the Proposed Effort:  Proposers must demonstrate that their team has the necessary background and experience to perform this project. The balance of the technical capabilities of the team must match that required in the program plan. The relevant experience of key personnel must be sufficient to provide confidence that the proposers can accomplish their objectives. Proposers must demonstrate that the combined facilities of the team are sufficient to accomplish the objectives of the proposal. Cost Realism:  Costs must be complete, reasonable and provide a high value to the Government.  The Government plans to make award decisions approximately 45 days after the closing of this BAA. The Government reserves the right to select for award some, none or portions of the proposals received under this solicitation, and to make award without discussions. The Government reserves the right to use grants, contracts or other transactions agreements as instruments for funding the proposals selected for award. All proprietary material submitted should be clearly marked as such and will be handled accordingly. All proposals must reference DARPA BAA 06-06.  Detailed solicitation information may be obtained through the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) available at http://www.darpa.mil/baa.  Aside from the PIP, no additional information is available. Requests for the same will be disregarded.

 JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1. The ELC intends to purchase the following items on Procurement Request 
Number: 216B830100016. The items are required for support of the P6 portable de-watering pump carried onboard various class Coast Guard cutters and aircraft.
        
          NSN			      Nomenclature		Part No.
2910-01-470-3073	Parts Kit, Fuel Sys.		KC00707
5331-01-470-3039 	O-RING			1843400
4720-01-470-3570	Hose, Nonmetallic		4402391
2910-01-470-5502	Carburetor Assembly               16100-ZLO-W51 

2.  It has been determined that negotiations should be conducted only with W.S. Darley Pump Division, 200 E. Walnut St, Chippewa Falls, WI 54729. Darley Pump is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Darley also developed and manufacturers the next higher assembly, the P6 emergency de-watering pump unit.

3. The P6 portable dewatering pump is a completely self-contained gasoline powered pump unit used exclusively for emergency de-watering of sinking vessels.  It’s designed to be dropped or lowered at sea from a helicopter or aircraft in its floatable storage container and retrieved by personnel on a distressed vessel. The floatable container not only carries the P6 pump unit, it also contains hoses and other equipment needed with the pump. It is completely self-contained package that can be quickly unpacked by personnel and put to use to pump out a sinking vessel. It is extremely critical for safety of both the distressed vessel and personnel that replacement parts, such as this hose, is readily available on a regular basis.

4. While the pump unit was developed, manufactured and tested in accordance with a Coast Guard specification, the specification covers performance characteristics only and does not define material make up and other technical characteristics of individual piece parts.  Such parts as those listed above must be capable of providing trouble free performance while withstanding extreme operating conditions and exposure to petroleum and other shipboard chemicals.

5. It is anticipated that the continued need for the listed items will be ongoing on a regular basis due to wear, damage or loss. Unless there is a change in design characteristics, these requirements will most likely have to be satisfied by other than full and open competition.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) intends to award a sole source bridge contract for a period up to 12 months for programmatic, joint experimentation, management, and administrative support in the definition, development, integration, testing and demonstration of Advanced Concept Technology Development programs for the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM).  The total value is estimated at $250,000.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) implemented under FAR 6.302-1 (a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The bridge is necessary to provide continuity of services pending completion of a competitive follow-on acquisition. The present contract with Camber Corporation, Huntsville, AL will end on or about 17 November 2005.  No other firm has the requisite knowledge and experience that can assume the highly specialized technical support without interruption of the ongoing operations. Camber Corporation has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security clearances. This unique working environment necessitates the award of a sole source bridge contract to the incumbent contractor, Camber Corporation.

The effort is required to implement the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) guidance; plan, coordinate and execute testing; and, assess military utility of advanced technologies, concepts and systems. Specific goals are to develop promising technologies in an operational environment to support current and emerging war fighting requirements. Additional objectives include support to OSD Transformation Guidance to enable information age warfare, interagency cooperation and coalition warfare. Development of new concept of operations, tactics and procedures is required to efficiently employ advanced technologies, concepts and systems under investigation. 

The intent of this sole source procurement is to provide continuity of services from Camber Corporation until the award and transition of the follow-on acquisition.   Information pertaining to the upcoming competitive acquisition for the ACTD program will be posted on FedBizOpps and the PEO STRI website at the following address: <http://www.peostri.army.mil/INDUSTRY/business.jsp> under the PEO STRI Solicitations link.

<DESC>In January 2005, Motorola, Inc. was issued a delivery order under DOI Contract NBC030009 to complete a radio system Site Survey and Recommend Communications Solution for the New River Gorge NR, Gauley River NRA and Bluestone NSR.  This project was implemented in order for the park to successfully migrate from an analog  radio system to the mandated Project 25 digital narrowband radio standard.  Following the specifications identified in the Recommended Communications Solution, the park made radio equipment purchases from Motorola under the established DOI and GSA contracts for handheld/portable, mobile and desktop radios.  A key elemet of this complex radio system conversion project is the system integration component offered by Motorola.  New River Gorge NR, Gauley River NRA and Bluestone NSR are located in rural southern West Virginia.  There is one full service radio shop within commuting/working distance of the park.  The radio shop is an authorized Motorola service and repair facility. This component  brings together all the elements of the conversion project under one vendor that can supply the system infrastructure, complete the installation, program the equipment, test system integration, insure compatibility and guaranty through an extended warranty that the entire radio system will function and be free from defect for an extended period of time.  To complete this project as described, a number of open market items need to be purchased through Motorola.  Purchasing these items will insure design specifications are met, compatibility with contract items purchased through IDIQ and GSA contracts with Motroloa is maintained, and the entire system is warranted to function as designed.

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, Inc., Prime Contractor to the NCI Frederick Cancer Research Facility will be issuing a Request for Proposal for this project on or about 10/26/05.  If you wish to receive a copy of the solicitation when it is issued, please contact Jeanne Lewis at jlewis@ncifcrf.gov.

To help meet the Challenge Goal of eliminating suffering and death from cancer by 2015, the NCI is capitalizing on the extraordinary momentum generated by advances in human genetic research.  The sequencing of the human genome and the annotation of common variations, together with new technologies for analyzing SNPs, have provided the tools for investigators to actively search for inherited variants in genes that increase or decrease cancer risk.  The convergence of sequencing the human genome, rapid progress in the International HapMap project, and the development of technologies that permit very large-scale SNP genotyping has made it possible to execute well-designed association studies using common variants across the entire genome to map low-penetrant genes involved in cancer susceptibility.  The results of such studies are expected to open new vistas in the search for causal pathways in cancer induction and progression that will lead to targets for novel intervention strategies.  

The Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) initiative (Cancer Bulletin, 2005, Vol 2, Number 16, page 7) will use the latest genomic technologies to perform dense whole genome scans to identify and validate susceptibility genes in the induction and progression of prostate and breast cancer (breast cancer is not the subject of this solicitation).  CGEMS represents a three-year NCI enterprise initiative that will be coordinated through the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), the NCI Core Genotyping Facility (CGF) and the NCI Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG). 
 
A major goal of CGEMS will be to make study findings publicly accessible within four months after completion of genotyping through the NCI’s Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). This access will ensure rapid sharing of results in order to stimulate further analytical and methodological use of the dataset by the extramural scientific community and point to genomic regions which can be followed-up by all investigators.

The objective of this solicitation is to seek a qualified vendor to perform a high quality, genome-wide scan of high density Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The requirement is to assay roughly 300,000 or more distinct SNP genotypes in each of approximately 2500 high quality genomic DNA samples (approximately 750,000,000 genotypes) within 90 days of the contract execution period. This period begins after contract award and specifically when the complete set of NCI samples has been received by the vendor. Fifty percent of the samples are pre-selected prostate cancer cases and other half matched controls. Five Ug of genomic DNA from each sample has already been extracted, quantitated and is currently available for this project. A completion rate of greater than 95% per sample and a per-locus genotype error rate under 0.3% are required. SNP locus selection must follow a specified selection methodology to accomplish the scientific goals of the project.

<DESC>Request for Information
10 Print Scanner Requirement Workshop
September 29, 2005

1.0 Introduction

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of State (DOS), National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Department of Defense Biometric Fusion Center (DOD/BFC), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), have jointly defined an urgent, near-term demand for faster, smaller, more mobile, 10 fingerprint slap capture devices to meet critical national security needs.  These departments have organized a unified User Group in order to develop standardized requirements and to co-sponsor a “Challenge to Industry” as a first step towards meeting these common needs.  

The purpose of this notice is to invite all fingerprint scanner hardware and software vendors to a 10 Print Scanner Requirements Workshop, to be held at NIST on October 13, 2005 at 1:30PM.

2.0 Background

One of the key drivers behind this initiative is the DHS requirement to biometrically register and screen foreign visitors to the United States based on an Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Standard (EFTS) compliant 10-print slap capture at enrollment and 2-print slap verification thereafter. Meeting this mandate will enhance the ability to match enrollees against latent prints; streamline the criminal background check process by eliminating the need for data extracts; mitigate concerns about false negatives when matching enrollees against poor quality prints; and ensure fast processing time in resolving false positives, especially as the size of the matching pool grows.  

DHS plans to deploy currently available 10-print capture technology to selected locations where the current technology is operationally feasible, but the size, mobility, speed, and power requirements of these existing devices have critical impacts to many of the current facilities. Enhancements are necessary to support viable operations at other locations.

The User Group has determined that the DHS requirements in this area are shared by other Departments, and has expressed their common and critical needs for new scanner technology with operational performance characteristics for use within their existing biometric applications.  The User Group is sponsoring a “Challenge to Industry” to provide 10-print capture devices meeting the processing time and size requirements and meeting FBI and industry format and quality requirements within the next 12 months to support the critical mission needs of the user community, and, specifically, to meet the aggressive mission requirements of DHS.  

To achieve these joint objectives, improved 10-print capture devices and capture software are needed to support the fast capture of 10 print slaps.
  
The User Group is very interested in challenging industry to expedite technology improvements to ensure needed capability can be deployed as quickly as possible.  For planning purposes the anticipated scale of enhanced device deployment, within the next 12-18 months, may range from 3,000 – 10,000 units across government agencies.

The User Group invites fingerprint capture hardware and software vendors to an 10 Print Scanner Requirements Workshop, to be hosted by NIST on Thursday, October 13th, 2005, at 1:30 pm at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD facility.  

This workshop will provide more detailed information about the requirements, clarify business and technical questions that may be raised, and begin the process of determining the potential for industry to meet the requirements in the needed timeframe.

3.0 Requirements of Ten Slap Print Capture Device 

The current version of the requirements generated by the User Group is attached to this notice, but may be refined as a result of our engagement with industry. 

4.0 Market Research

This workshop is intended as  “market research” by the Government, to determine whether industry can develop innovative technology to meet the requirements of all the agencies participating in the workshop within an abbreviated timeframe.  

The Government intends to continue working with industry over the near term on this ten print effort, however, interested parties are advised that none of the participating Departments are under any obligation to take any further action with any party as a result of this market research effort.  

Following this workshop, the User Group may conduct a series of one on one meetings with selected members of industry to gain additional insight into the state of the market and how industry proposes to meet these new requirements.  The Government will schedule these meetings based on its review of the five-page overview of the vendors approach to meeting these new requirements within the necessary time frame.  

All information supplied in response to this request will be shared within the User Group. The working group consists of both Government and non-Government participants.  All proprietary information shall be appropriately labeled to ensure proper handling of sensitive corporate information. 

5.0 Desired Response

The Government requests that firms interested in this requirement provide the following information:

a.	A summary paper must be submitted with each response to the RFI. The purpose of the summary paper is to help the government understand how you intend to meet the attached requirements within 12- months or forecasting what capabilities can be delivered within this timeframe. 

The summary paper requested should not be a marketing tool. It is an information tool that will be used by the US-VISIT program and other government agencies in their search for new technologies, and to familiarize all stakeholders with the technologies you describe.  The information on the summary paper should be accurate, succinct, complete and descriptive of the technology.  The summary paper should not exceed 5 pages using 12-point Times New Roman type. 


b.	Any descriptive literature for existing product that can be enhanced or modified to meet these new requirements. 

Please submit the information requested by noon, October 27, 2005 in three hardcopies and one electronic copy to Shelby Buford, Jr. at Suite 1800, 1616 N. Ft. Myer Drive, Arlington, VA 22209.  No email submissions will be accepted.

6.0 Comments

Please submit questions and comments on the attached Requirements by noon, October 10, 2005 to Ms. Myrtle Miller, US-VISIT by email at myrtle.v.miller@DHS.gov.

1.0 Introduction

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of State (DOS), National Institute of Justice (NIJ), Department of Defense Biometric Fusion Center (DOD/BFC), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), have jointly defined an urgent, near-term demand for faster, smaller, more mobile, 10 fingerprint slap capture devices to meet critical national security needs.  These departments have organized a unified User Group in order to develop standardized requirements and to co-sponsor a “Challenge to Industry” as a first step towards meeting these common needs.  These requirements represent the consensus position of the participants of the User Group.  

The User Group identified the need for a 10 print capture scanner device (the “Scanner”), along with client- and server-based utility software (the “Software”), including slap quality, segmentation, sequence verification, fingerprint image quality, compression, and other utilities. The Scanner and Software shall be interoperable, that is, any approved Scanner shall work with any approved Software and vice versa. 

The essential operational requirements of the Scanner and Software, some of which are not met currently by the Industry, include the following general objectives: 
 
1.	Meet the current space requirements (6”x6”x6”) constraints of the deployment facilities.
2.	Be mobile so as to support multiple operational scenarios.
3.	Perform all the ten print capture processing steps including individual finger segmentation and image quality checks within 5 seconds per slap, from the time the subject places his/her fingers on the Scanner, to the moment the capture Software has segmented, analyzed image quality, and delivered status to the operator. 
4.	Be powered without an additional 120v power plug in order to meet power capacity and power cabling constraints of the current facilities. 
5.	Comply with the current biometric industry standards
6.	Meet or exceed fingerprint quality requirements contained in the latest version (7.1) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification, Appendix F.  

The size of the Scanner, power requirements, and speed of both the Software and Scanner will have critical impacts on current facilities and operations. Although we are not aware of any technology existing today that is able to meet these parameters, we intend to minimize the negative impacts of 10-print capture deployment to environments and populations where delays in processing are intolerable.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The solicitation number for this effort is hereby changed from W15P7T-05-R-N009 TO W115P7T-06-R-N009. The Government intends to Award a sole source contract for the Production of the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) Receiver- ADDSI  Receiver-Transmitter, NSN 5820-01-514-1408, P/N A3285962.  The Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) is a tactical data radio system that is currently in production and is managed by Project Manager, Tactical Radio Communications Systems, Fort Monmouth, NJ. EPLRS provides a mobile wireless data comm unications backbone for the Army's Tactical Internet, provides embedded situational awareness/position navigation, and is a common system for Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps warfighters. EPLRS is a key enabler for network centric warfare. EPLRS supp orts the Modular Army and is interoperable with US Air Force, US Marine Corps and US Navy EPLRS Radios. EPLRS mobile networks are used by Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) and Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) host computers for situat io nal awareness and command & control. EPLRS consists of an EPLRS Network Manager (ENM) and radios that can be configured for manpack, vehicular and airborne use. FedBizOpps Numbered Note 22 applies. The Government conducted market research in May 2005 and d etermined that Raytheon is the only source that possesses the cabability and knowledge to meet the Government's requirements. The Raytheon Company is the developer and prime contractor for EPLRS radios and the EPLRS Net Manager. Raytheon Company maintains configuration management of internal modules and maintains the software source code. The Government does not have detailed documentation on hardware modules, software/firmware or source code. Consequently, the Government does not have the detailed document ation or source code to provide to a third party. A technical data package is not available. Scope of Effort: The Government's requirement for EPLRS calls for the Firm-Fixed-Price acquisition of up to approximately 3,000 EPLRS ADDSI Receiver-Transmitters ( RTs), with inherent production qualification testing and initial software programming requirements. Contract award is planned for the 1st or 2nd quarter of Fiscal Year 06. The resultant contact is expected to consist of a base year and one (1) option year.  It is expected that initial deliveries shall commence within six (6) months after receipt of order. Production rates should average 200 radios per month with a surge capability of up to 400 radios per month. This will allow the Department of Defense to co ntinue to implement its objective to digitize and modularize the battlefield. Any radios produced under this proposed contract will be fully interoperable with the currently fielded system. The Communications-electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC)has established the Army Single Face to Industry Website to allow the electronic submittal of Requests for Proposals (RFPs), Request for Quotes (RFQs) and Invitation for bids (IFBs) from C-E LCMC to Industry.

<CONTACT>Wilma Estrada, 757-878-5003
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Center is soliciting technical and cost proposals for an effort entitled Active/Passive Aircraft Survivability (APAS). The program objective is to deve lop, integrate, and demonstrate a low-cost aircraft self-protection suite that is highly effective in detecting, disrupting, and defeating small arms, Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) and Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) threats, typical of non-lin ear battlefield environments. The APAS program will provide the mechanism to tap aircraft survivability technologies currently being developed within the DoD and industry. The APAS program will enable survivable operations that allow for freedom of maneuve r, battlefield persistence, and combat overmatch for aviation assets. Government technologies under development by the Government that may be integrated and demonstrated under APAS are signature reduction components including engine IR suppression system, thermal insulation, IR paints/coatings, and IR threat countermeasure / jammer technologies such as an enhanced ALQ-144A IR jammer system, the Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) and potentially other technologies under development by the Government. For p urposes of the subject solicitation, the IR signature reduction components will be Government developed, integrated and demonstrated. This solicitation is to acquire Contractor effort to design, analyze, develop, fabricate, integrate, and flight test Hosti le Fire Indication (HFI) and Visual Acquisition Disruption (VAD) technologies and optional IR signature suppression technologies. The HFI system will detect and precisely locate small arms and RPG threats and present this threat information visually to the  aircrew to enhance situational awareness and self-protection capability. The VAD system will degrade the small arms and RPG shooters ability to maintain accurate track or effectively engage aircraft targets within the disruption zone. The Contractor will  provide familiarization and incorporate a combined industry/Government flight crew concept to enable the Government demonstration of the entire (Government and industry) APAS technology suite using only Government experimental test pilots. Contractor invo lvement during Government flight demonstration will be limited to troubleshooting and maintenance support of Contractor-developed components installed on the test aircraft. The Government will furnish either an Apache AH-64D or a Blackhawk UH-60L aircraft for the APAS system demonstration activities. Limited Government furnished data is available and no aircraft specific data will be provided. Line of sight, space, weight and power information associated with Government-integrated technologies will be provi ded for proposal preparation purposes. The subjects of this solicitation are the HFI and VAD technologies; however, should an offeror have innovative alternative technical solutions for IR suppression, which meet or exceed the program objectives or offer l esser performance at significant cost savings, they may be proposed as options and they will be considered. Note, however, if such options are proposed, FAR 52.217-3, Evaluation Exclusive of Options, applies and the options will not be included in the eval uation for award purposes. A single, cost-plus fixed-fee contract is anticipated. The total estimated amount of the acquisition is $13M, exclusive of any options proposed. It is anticipated that no more than $1M of Government funding will be available for any/all optional effort(s). The planned total period of performance for this effort is 33 months with an anticipated award date on/around 31 March 2006. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be made available to potential offerors, not sooner than 15 days fo llowing publication of this notice in FedBizOpps. Proposals must follow the guidelines described in this notice and in Section L of the RFP. This program is cla ssified SECRET Collateral and is subject to export controls. Offerors will be required to handle classified information up to a level of SECRET and must have a current SECRET facility clearance and storage capability to receive this solicitation. A DD Form  254, Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification, will be provided with the solicitation. A certified copy of DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement (see Note 8) must be submitted along with your written request for a copy of the RFP. Your written request may be mailed to AATD, ATTN: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C, Wilma Estrada (Contract Specialist) or Sharon Horton (Contracting Officer), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis VA 23604-5577; may be sent by facsimile at 757-878- 0008; or may be emailed to wilma.estrada@aatd.eustis.army.mil or sharon.horton@aatd.eustis.army.mil. This action is not set aside for small businesses. Only qualified U.S. sources may participate as prime contractors. The North American Industry Classifica tion system (NAICS) code applicable to this procurement is 541710. The small business size standard for number of employees is 1000 for Aircraft Parts, and Auxiliary Equipment, and Aircraft Engine Parts. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which  if received timely, shall be considered by the agency. Notes 8 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The following information is provided as a change, or clarification to, the presolicitation number 09062005:  (1) Solicitation Number is changed from 09062005 to F2XTA15074A100; (2) the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) was a DRAFT only; (3) Section L "Instructions to Offerors" and Section M "Evaluation Factors" should be removed and NOT a part of this contract action; and, (4) there is NO PRICING requested at this time, as this posting is for informational puposes only.

In addition, there were two (2) questions posed from the pre-solicitation notice.  Both the questions and answers are as follows:

Question 1:   At the time the Air Force Beta tested the LawManager case management system, was it compatible with LexisNexis?  Is it compatible now?  May we receive a copy of any technical compatibility analysis with third party information providers done by LawManager?
 
Answer 1:  The Thomson/Elite contract requires it to provide an interface between LawManager and either LexisNexis or Westlaw, whichever is awarded this contract for electronic research. There is no such interface with LexisNexis at this time. Compatibility with LawManager is not an evaluation criterion. The awardee is simply required to cooperate with Thomson Elite in providing the technical information (e.g., URL information) needed to implement the links to the electronic research system from LawManager as described in PWS 2.3. 
 

Question 2:  Section L - Instructions to Offerors, asks for a count of the databases included.  Please define databases.  As we use the term, it is meant to be a group of sources.  Sources are a single publication (i.e., The New York Times).  There will be more databases than sources since each source has its own, 
Individual Database  and then will also be grouped in numerous other databases.  As an example, the single Source The New York Times is located in 141 different databases on our research system.


Answer 2:  The most useful count is of the number of unique sources. Counting the same source numerous times based on inclusion in multiple groups is not desired. However, a description of groupings is additional useful information; that could be provided in an existing database directory.

<DESC>1. The Federal Aviation Administration is planning to compete its Enterprise Architecture and Solutions Environment (EASE) requirement.  With regard to planning, the EASE Program Office (PO) seeks comments on the attached draft Screening Information Request (SIR) and Statement of Work.  The draft SIR is without Sections L and M.  Those sections are currently being drafted.  The PO is open for written comment(s) only from the date of this announcement until October 26, 2005.  The PO does not intend to engage in written or verbal discussion with the author of the comment. Comments will merely be considered for use in enhancing the quality of the SIR.  In any event, the PO is not obligated to directly or indirectly respond either in writing or verbally to the author's comment.  Telephone comments or discussions are unacceptable and will not be entertained.  In view of the above discussion, please direct all comments to the following e-mail address:	glenn.a.Wilson@faa.gov 2. Market Survey:	In accordance with paragraph 5.3.4 of the AMS, this market survey is being conducted in order to obtain information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, small businesses (8(a) certified and other small businesses) or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information in triplicate from interested vendors: Capability Statement - In view of the scope of the attached draft EASE SOW, this document should describe capability and identify past performance references concerning operation and maintenance of a computing facility of similar size and scope for five years within the past seven years, with an availability rate of 99% percent or better.  (Limited to 5 pages) Resumes - These resumes should be provided for those individuals that are expected to be identified as key personnel in conjunction with the Key Personnel paragraph in the SIR. Expected approach to provide the computing facility, hardware and software components to augment FAA-provided equipment, disaster facilities, and staffing as stated in the SOW. Expected approach to migrate work to the new facility with not more than 72 hours service disruption. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent.  The FAA Acquisition Management System clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations On Subcontracting will apply. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form.  If applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. Attached is the present draft of the statement of work.  The functions identified therein are to be continued throughout the period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this effort is 54153 (Size Standard is $21 Million). This market survey is for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a commitment, or a promise to contract by the Government.  This market survey does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of responses. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition. However, the failure of adequate and appropriate 8(a) business or small business participation in this market survey will result in a full and open competition. With regard to this survey, interested respondents must submit information requested by the date and to the point of contact identified in paragraph one above.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Centers (COAC) has a requirement for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a non-competitive award to Dr. Mark Moore, 880 Blandford Blvd., Redwood City, California 94062, to continue to provide to the NHGRI services associated with the Knockout Mouse Genome Project (KOMP).  Dr. Moore has gained an in-depth knowledge of this project to create an inventory of existing and available genes trapped or mutated by gene targeting in ES cells or mice.  He has performed a previous contract related to the early phases of this project.  Dr. Moore has knowledge and experience in developmental immunology and gene knockout technology.  He helped NIH plan, write and publish the Request for applications (RFA) and assisted with the intellectual property issues, inventory of existing ES cells, organization of a major workshop and design of the program.  He established Genetentech’s gene knockout facilities and directed research programs in immunology and inflammation at the University of Southern California.  In order to maintain continuity of the work that has already been performed, award of a contract to any other source would result in duplication of effort and substantial expense to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Scope of work is as follows: Background:  NIH published a set of (RFAs) that established the KOMP to create a null mutation in every gene in the mouse genome, the purpose is to breed mice with specific silenced genes to identify the functions of specific genes that can be used as models for human diseases.  Deliverables: Dr. Moore shall continue with the following tasks: 1) To work assist applicants interested in applying for the KOMP program to understand the scope of the project; 2) To assist NHGRI staff and a Trans NIH working group assess the outcome of the review of applications; 3) To help prepare recommendations to the Director of NHGRI and the KOMP working group regarding the eventual scope of the program; 4) To continue to work closely with the participating NIH Institutes, major international centers in Germany and U.S. centers in the development of this project.  The period of performance will begin On November 1, 2005 through May, 1 2006.   The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710, and Size Standard is 500.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.   Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLB-PS-(HG)-2006-011-CDM   may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, Building RKL2, Suite 6042, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention Ms. Cecilia Morales, Contract specialist on November 1, 2005 at or before 4:00 p.m. Eastern time.

The Census Bureau expects to award this contract in the fourth quarter of Government Fiscal Year 2005.  Information on this acquisition will be posted on the IDS web site at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/ids/ids.html.

<DESC>The 7th Bomb Wing established the Commander’s Operational Picture (COP) office with the specific guidance to implement the policies, guide strategic planning, acquisition, and integration of the COP system into an operational environment. One of the major tenets of this framework is the management of information and knowledge. The 7th Bomb Wing (7 BW) COP Office has directed the 7th Communications Squadron to take control of the COP and Dyess Decision Support Tool Set (DSTS) processes within Dyess AFB. As the 7 CS is not manned with an Air Force web programmer/database administrator to accomplish the task, contractor support is required.

The Statement of Work covers planning, implementation planning and support tasks associated with maintaining effective COP/DSTS policy, organizational structure, and associated mechanisms and processes on behalf of the 7th Communications Squadron.  Initially, work will be focused on COP/DSTS:  its conceptual design, sustainment and maintenance, maturation, and integration support for the 7th Bomb Wing Commander’s Operational Picture and Dyess Decision Support Tool Set.  Tasks include supporting the operation and maintenance of the COP/DSTS, resources, integrating other 7 BW COP/DSTS identified web-based and non-web-based tools, and providing strategic/tactical COP/DSTS master planning schedule development and maintenance. Integral to the COP/DSTS effort is the technical and analytic support required to maintain and improve 7 BW COP/DSTS architecture, system design, system development, programming, training, and server administration.

<DESC>Low Hazard Flexible Linear Shaped Charges (LHFLSC) have a continuous explosive core of plastic bonded explosive (IAW MIL-E-46676) with a flexible copper-polymer liner, encased in lightweight polyethylene foam.  Charges are 20 feet long, but may be cu t for specific applications.  The explosive core, which varies with the size of the charge (see table below) is shaped in the form of an inverted V.    The underside of the charge has an adhesive-backed tape which adheres to most dry smooth surfaces.  Th e two piece polyethylene foam sheath has a built-in stand-off and is colored olive drab or black.  LHFLSC, also known as Explosive Cutting Tapes, are designed to produce a linear cutting action in various applications where remote, fast and reliable cuttin g of obstacles and other targets is required.  When initiated, by either electric or non-electric methods, the charge produces no shrapnel or lead contaminants, unlike conventional lead-sheathed flexible linear shaped charges.   The following list provides summary information about LHFLSC: Item: MK 143 Mod 0, DODIC MM51, NSN 1375-01-328-5796, 0.91width x 0.63height (inches), 600 grains/foot (nominal), 660 grains/foot (maximum), 1.886 pounds/20 feet, 3.564 grams/inch, 15.43 explosive weight/package (pounds), Packaging Drawing 6736479.

<CONTACT>Patrick J. Backus, (586)753-2322
<DESC>Request For Information Non-primary Power Source for Ground Combat Systems General: The Program Executive Office for Ground Combat Systems (PEO GCS) is interested in obtaining a common Non-primary Power Source (NPS) for the M1A2 Abrams SEP, M2A3 Bradley and Stryker family of combat vehicles. Our interest is in current or very near term te chnologies which can be integrated into the vehicle platforms with minimal vehicle modifications. An NPS is defined as a non-primary power source that can provide power to the system power bus.  The NPS can be: 1. Engine/Generator 2. Battery pack(s) 3. Fuel Cell(s) 4. Other technology The goal is to identify an NPS that is 100% common across the vehicle platforms.  However, the PEO is willing to consider different NPS models that are less than 100% common as long as the models maximize commonality of the NPS components across the vehicl e platforms while still meeting the individual vehicle requirements.  It is desired that products offered should be existing military or commercially available hardware.  FYI: The most immediate (near term) NPS requirement is for the Abrams Tank. This is not a request for a proposal (RFP) but a request for information to be used for planning purposes only. The complete questionnaire may be found in its entirety at the TACOM  Warren Procurement Network website (PROCNET):  http://contracting.tacom.a rmy.mil/ssn/sources.htm.  PEO GCS requests that you complete the questionnaire and provide the necessary technical data/supporting data that will allow the PEO to assess whether or not your NPS can satisfy the needs of the vehicle platforms. The NPS system  may be offered by an NPS manufacturer or by a system integrator working in conjunction with an NPS manufacturer. Please note: PEO GCS intends to provide the questionnaire responses and any detailed information provided by the offeror to the vehicle systems prime contractors and/or PEO GCS and TARDEC support contractors in order to assist in the Government assessment s. See the release statement at the beginning of the questionnaire. Replies to this questionnaire must be received by 23 November 2005.  Replies to the questionnaire should be sent electronically via email to Ms. Denise King at kingde@tacom.army.mil.  Replies that cannot be sent via email may be sent to: U.S. Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command Attn:  SFAE-GCS-CS-C (D. King), M/S 507 6501 E. Eleven Mile Road Warren, Michigan  48397-5000 Your reply to this questionnaire is voluntary and no compensation can be made for your participation. Questions regarding access to the questionnaire on the TACOM PROCNET website should be directed to Mr. Patrick Backus at backusp@tacom.army.mil. Thank you for your participation.

MEMORANDUM FOR 42 CONS/LGCB

FROM: AWC/DF

SUBJECT: Sole Source Justification

1. The Air War College, Department of International Security (AWC/DFI) requests that Dr. Robert L. Wendzel, Ph.D. in Political Science, specializing in International Security Studies (ISS), to teach the AWC National Security and Decision-Making (NSDM) and Global Security (GS) Courses as well as serving as a seminar mentor for the National Security Forum (NSF). The position requires background knowledge, course preparation, classroom execution and curriculum development, as well as the grading of examinations, the reading of papers, student advising, and assisting in faculty issues. 


	a. An active duty AF member was assigned as faculty to the AWC. Due to higher personnel priorities, the colonel was diverted from this AWC assignment on 14 Jul 2005. Due to this short notice and the inability to fill with an IPA, a sole source is being sought in order to fulfill the teaching requirement for the two courses: National Security and Decision-Making and Global Security courses.


	b. Dr. Wendzel is the only known source in the local area that possesses the capabilities to meet the immediate needs of the AWC. The National Security and Decision-Making (NSDM) course runs from 3 November to 16 December 2005. The Global Security (GS) course runs from 15 March to 28 April 2006. In addition, Dr. Wendzel’s expertise is required to serve on the faculty team administrating the National Security Forum (15 to 19 May 2006). The contractor will conduct all blocks of instruction and associated curriculum development processes as described above. This will be on a one-time need from 1 November to 19 May 2006. 

	c. AWC/DFI does not anticipate any future sourcing required from the ISS community, as a military member will fill this position. 

2. Colonel Stephen Wright, Department Chair for International Security (DFI) is our point of contact and can be reached at xxxxxx..

No. 12008800 and 12008801.   503   Operational tests  Assure that the valve can be set to all three positions with ease by applying a constant hand force to the handle.   The movement of rotational parts should be smooth (constant friction).  Set the valve to an open position. Apply 3000 +/- 50 psi at temperature between 70 and 120 F.  Turn the handle to the close position.  There should be no fluid flow in either direction.  Set the valve to a reverse flow position.  Apply 3000 +/- 50 psi at temperature between 70 and 120 F.  Record the Input and Output pressures, and  the temperature.  Any malfunction of this valve shall be cause for rejection. 504   Flow rate - Set the valve to an open position. Apply 3000 +/- 50 psi at temperature between 70 and 120 F. With the 3000 +/- 50 psi the minimum flow rate at the fully open position should be 2 GPM.  Set the valve to a reverse flow position.  Apply 300 0 +/- 50 psi at temperature between 70 and 120 F.  With the 3000 +/- 50 psi the minimum flow rate at the fully open position should be 2 GPM. 505   Proof pressure  A Proof pressure of 4,500 psi shall be applied at a temperature between 70 and 120 F for at least two successive times and held for a minimum of 2 minutes. The valve should be pressurized in both directions separately as indicated in  the Operational test.  The valve shall be operated in its normal function between applications of the test pressure. 506   Burst pressure  A Burst pressure of 7,500 psi shall be applied at a temperature between 70 and 120 for at least two successive times and held for a minimum of 2 minutes. The valve should be pressurized in both directions separately as indicated in t he Operational test.  The valve shall not rupture under this pressure nor shall leakage exceed that permitted in the external leakage test specified herein.  This should be the last test performed because of its destructive nature 507   Internal leakage  With the valve in the open position, apply 3000 +/- 50 psi hydraulic pressure for 30 min.  Repeat the same with the valve in the closed, and in the reversed flow position respectively.  The internal leakage shall not exceed 1 cc pe r minute.  508   Low temperature - Set the valve to an open position, and apply 3000 +/- 50 psi. Stabilize the temperature at  65 F for 3 hours. Turn the handle to the close position.  There should be no fluid flow in either direction.  Set the valve to a reverse fl ow position.  Apply 3000 +/- 50 psi.  Assure that the valve can be set to all three positions with ease.   The movement of rotational parts should be smooth (constant friction). The internal leakage shall not exceed  1 cc per minute.  Any malfunction of th is valve shall be cause for rejection. 509   High temperature - Set the valve to an open position, and apply 3000 +/- 50 psi.  Stabilize the temperature at 140 F for 3 hours.  Turn the handle to the close position.  There should be no fluid flow in either direction.  Set the valve to a reverse flow position.  Apply 3000 +/- 50 psi.  Assure that the valve can be set to all three positions with ease.   The movement of rotational parts should be smooth (constant friction). The internal leakage shall not exceed  1 cc per minute.  Any malfunction of this valve shall be cause for rejection. 510   External leakage - During the course of all of the above tests, external leakage, other than a slight wetting insufficient to form a drop, shall be cause for rejection. 511   Endurance The assembly shall be subjected to 2000 full duty cycles of operation as specified in the Operational Test.  At the conclusion of the endurance test, the component shall operate satisfactorily and shall be disassembled and careful ly inspected.

 JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THEN
FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1. The ELC intends to purchase the following items on Procurement Request 
Number: 216B830100016. The items are required for support of the P6 portable de-watering pump carried onboard various class Coast Guard cutters and aircraft.
        
          NSN			      Nomenclature		Part No.
2910-01-470-3073	Parts Kit, Fuel Sys.		KC00707
5331-01-470-3039 	O-RING			1843400
4720-01-470-3570	Hose, Nonmetallic		4402391
2910-01-470-5502	Carburetor Assembly               16100-ZLO-W51 

2.  It has been determined that negotiations should be conducted only with W.S. Darley Pump Division, 200 E. Walnut St, Chippewa Falls, WI 54729. Darley Pump is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Darley also developed and manufacturers the next higher assembly, the P6 emergency de-watering pump unit.

3. The P6 portable dewatering pump is a completely self-contained gasoline powered pump unit used exclusively for emergency de-watering of sinking vessels.  It’s designed to be dropped or lowered at sea from a helicopter or aircraft in its floatable storage container and retrieved by personnel on a distressed vessel. The floatable container not only carries the P6 pump unit, it also contains hoses and other equipment needed with the pump. It is completely self-contained package that can be quickly unpacked by personnel and put to use to pump out a sinking vessel. It is extremely critical for safety of both the distressed vessel and personnel that replacement parts, such as this hose, is readily available on a regular basis.

4. While the pump unit was developed, manufactured and tested in accordance with a Coast Guard specification, the specification covers performance characteristics only and does not define material make up and other technical characteristics of individual piece parts.  Such parts as those listed above must be capable of providing trouble free performance while withstanding extreme operating conditions and exposure to petroleum and other shipboard chemicals.

5. It is anticipated that the continued need for the listed items will be ongoing on a regular basis due to wear, damage or loss. Unless there is a change in design characteristics, these requirements will most likely have to be satisfied by other than full and open competition.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND
The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA’s Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA’s response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.
INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES
The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services on a temporary, on-call, basis as a Response Alternatives for Technical Services.

HSAR 3009.104-75  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision)

HSAR 3009.104-75  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

										
SOLICITATION HSCG80-05-Q-313V37                                                 

SUBJECT:  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Pursuant to the requirements of FAR 13.501(a) Sole Source Acquisitions, the following facts and rationale are presented:

	(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a “Justification for other than full and open competition.” – U.S. Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCLANT), Naval Engineering Division, Vessel Procurement and Logistics Branch, Norfolk, VA, hereby presents this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC) for review and approval.

        	(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. – This Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition seeks approval to contract with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Northrop Grumman Sperry Marine Systems or a certified Sperry Marine Systems distributor.  Request approval to proceed with this sole source acquisition, for a firm fixed-price purchase order for Sperry Marine Rascar Radar Model 2500-M-X X-Band Radar and Model 2500M-3145 S-band Radar Parts.  Simplified acquisition procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  

	(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value). – This Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is to obtain approval for the procurement of Sperry Marine Rascar Radar Model 2500-M-X X-Band Radar and Model 2500M-3145 S-Band Radar Parts.  The primary function of the Rascar Radar is to navigational information regarding other ships for the purpose of safe navigation and interception of other vessels.   The radar provides this navigational information for the WPC-179 Cyclone Class Patrol Coastal ships.  The information provided by this radar system is vital to the ships ability to perform its law enforcement and national defense missions and to safely navigate.  This requirement is essential to the mission capability of the U.S. Coast Guard's  WPC-179 Cyclone Class Patrol Coastal ships.  The estimated dollar value for this procurement is $105,000.00.

	(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. – Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as implemented by FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

	(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. – Rascar Radar Model 2500-M-27X-Band Radar and Model 2500M-3145 S-Band Radar Parts are currently in use on the WPC-179 Cyclone Class Patrol Coastal radar systems.  Utilizing Northup Grumman’s Sperry Marine Systems (OEM) for the Sperry Marine Rascar Radar Parts will maintain the design function of the Rascar Radar system and minimize failure due to non-compatible parts.  The necessary 
SOLICITATION  HSCG80-05-Q-313V37

SUBJECT:  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


manufacturing data are proprietary and controlled by Northup Grumman Sperry Marine Systems.  The data was not procured for the radars currently used on the WPC-179 Cyclone Class Patrol Coastal ships and therefore were not available for release to generate competition 

	(6)  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether an EPS notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2, and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. – In accordance with FAR 5.201, the intent to contract for Sperry Marine Radar Parts will be advertised on the Electronic Posting System (EPS)/FedBizOpps.  

	(7)  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. – It is the Contracting Officer’s opinion that prices for this procurement will be fair and reasonable based on limited competition between privately owned businesses, price analysis and similar items used in the commercial marketplace.  Additionally, proposed prices will undergo comparison with previously prices paid. 

	(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. – There are several sources that manufacture similar radars in the commercial marketplace; however, a similar unit would require unique modifications to the Sperry Marine Rascar Radar System.  Sperry Marine Rascar Radar Model 2500-M27X X-Band and 2500M-3145 S-Band are only radars that meets form, fit and function required without modification to the Radar Systems.  

	(9) A listing of the sources, if any, which expressed in writing, an interest in the acquisition. –   Only one company, Northrop Grumman, responded to the Sources Sought posted to FedBizOpps.  Northup Grumman is the OEM for the Sperry Marine Rascar Radars.  A presolicitation notice will be issued on FedBizOpps.  All interested companies will be considered.  

(10) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. – The Coast Guard does not possess technical expertise nor did they purchase the data as part of the initial system acquisition for the Sperry Marine Rascar Radar System to foster a competitive procurement effort.  Complete specifications and drawings are not available and the cost to procure them is not easily quantifiable.  As a result, it would be difficult to foster competition, as the Coast Guard does not have copyrights, proprietary data, adequate technical descriptions of the manufacturing, performance and acceptance data for the radars.  The current systems are deteriorating to the

SUBJECT:  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
	

point that system replacement is being looked at for the future at which time the Coast Guard intends to develop a specification, which will promote competition.  In the meantime the Sperry Marine Rascar Radar System must be replaced with remanufactured parts from the original equipment manufacturer, Northrop Gurmman Sperry Marine Systems or authorized distributor.  

(12) I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
