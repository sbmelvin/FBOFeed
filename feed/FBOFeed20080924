Description
This is a presolicitation notice for potential offerors interetested in privatizing the natural gas distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY. Privatization, under 10 USC 2688, is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system. The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  
The Niagara Falls ARS is located about 6 miles east of the city of Niagara Falls and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York. The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point where the distribution system enters the Installation, and Government ownership starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the right of way. The system may include pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization are the 107th Air Refueling Wing natural gas mains and laterals. Approximately 7,360 linear feet of polyethylene pipe supply natural gas to 16 buildings on the 107th ARW. These lines are owned by National Fuels Gas.  
	The 914th AW and the 107th ARW maintain separate natural gas distribution systems on the Niagara Falls ARS. National Fuel Gas Company supplies natural gas to both systems. Within the boundary of 107th ARW, the gas distribution mains and laterals are owned by National Fuels Gas so they are not included in this offering. The natural gas distribution system on the 914th side of the base contains polyethylene pipe and iron pipe. The pipe sizes vary from 1 inch to 6 inches in diameter. 
Gas enters the 914th natural gas distribution system at the main entrance on Lockport Road. It is delivered through a pressure regulator that drops the pressure to about 5 psi for distribution through the 914th AW owned system. Roughly 3/4 of the gas distribution system on the 914th side of the base was replaced with new polyethylene pipe before 1999. Roughly 40 percent of the laterals were replaced; the remaining laterals are about the same age as the buildings they feed. A project to replace the remaining iron part of the gas main (installed in the 1950's and has reached the end of its useful life) is planned but not funded at this time. Gas is measured at the bulk meter near the regulator at the entrance to the site.
Inventories will be included in the RFP.
The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

The Niagara Falls ARS is located about 6 miles east of the city of Niagara Falls and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York. The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The location that Niagara Falls ARS now occupies began as the initial structures for the Bell Aircraft Corporation in 1943. The Installation was redesigned as a US Naval Air Station in 1946, when further expansion and construction took place. The base has expanded several times over the years and now has 107 buildings (industrial and commercial). The base has some Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing.
The wastewater collection system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the right of way. The system may include pipelines, manholes, lift stations, valves, controls, treatment plants, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the wastewater collection system privatization are the oil/water separators, and grease traps.
	The wastewater collection system serves both the 914th AW and the 107th ARW. The wastewater collection system on the base contains both gravity and pressure flow sewer mains. Most of the collection system on the 914th ARW side of the base is PVC. In the early 1990s, a section of PVC pipe was installed as force main on the 914th side of the base. The wastewater collection system on the 107th side of the base consists of PVC pipe that was installed in 1996. Laterals connecting the buildings to the collection mains are typically cast iron and were installed with the buildings during the 1950s.
	Wastewater collection pipe diameter ranges from 3 to 12 inches. There are two wastewater collection pump stations on the Niagara Falls ARS and about 101 access manholes. Wastewater from the base is discharged through pump station 731 into a PVC force main to a manhole on collection main beneath Walmore Road east of the base. The receiving manhole belongs to Niagara County Sewer District No. 1. The wastewater for the entire base is metered at the Pump Station, Facility 731.
Wastewater discharge volumes are measured at the discharge pump station in building 731 on the Niagara Falls ARS wastewater system. Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 reported the wastewater discharge to be 40 million gallons in 1994. In 1998, the base owned flow meter records show that 37 million gallons were discharged from the base. Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 invoices the base for wastewater based on the meter in the pump station.
In calendar year 1998, the average monthly discharge was 3 million gallons per month. Peak discharge occurred in March 1998 at 6.7 million gallons, and the minimum monthly discharge was 1.4 million gallons in November. A net decrease in the square footage of buildings on the base is expected within the next 5 years as planned demolitions are completed. As a result, future wastewater system demand should decrease.
The 914th AW was issued an industrial waste permit with the Niagara County Sewer District No. 1 that expired June 1, 2000. Renewal of this permit was applied for by the 914th CEV.  Future permit renewals will be applied for by the 914th CEV.
	Inventory of the system will be included in the RFP.
	The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

Description
This is a presolicitation notice to potential offerors to potential sources to privatize the eletrical distribution system at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station in Niagara Falls, NY. Privatization, under 10 USC 2688, is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system. The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  

The Niagara Falls ARS is located about 6 miles east of the city of Niagara Falls and 20 miles north of Buffalo, New York. The installation occupies roughly 985 acres, which includes 38.71 acres of land leased from the People of the State of New York acting by and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Lease No. DA NYDRE (A) 1901, which expires 30 June 2031 and 37.1 acres of land leased from Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, Lease No. DA CA51-9-84-74, which expires 30 June 2023, on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County, New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant.
The joint mission of the 914th AW and the 107th ARW is to provide trained Reservists and Guardsmen, equipment, and aircraft capable of responding to all contingencies in support of national interests. The 914th has a working population of 1,117 Reservists and 397 full time personnel, of which 209 are civilians. Buildings and apron occupy about 260 acres. The 107th has a working population of 552 assigned personnel, 260 active Reservists and military technicians, and 18 other employees. Buildings and apron occupy about 100 acres.
The location that Niagara Falls ARS now occupies began as the initial structures for the Bell Aircraft Corporation in 1943. The Installation was redesigned as a US Naval Air Station in 1946, when further expansion and construction took place. The base has expanded several times over the years and now has 107 buildings (industrial and commercial). The base has some Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing.
The Niagara Falls ARS electric distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Way. The system may include, but is not limited to, transformers, circuits, protective devices, utility poles, ductbanks, switches, street lighting fixtures, and other ancillary fixed equipment. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Under no circumstances shall the Contractor be entitled to any service charge adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.
Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are:
•	Concrete encasement and ducts carrying communication lines or empty ducts in underground circuit on property of the 107th ARW
•	Parking Lot & Security Lights that are fed directly from Buildings
•	emergency generators
•	Building 850 (supplies electric to Mast Lights)
•	Airfield lighting, apron lights, airfield lighting vaults, and all associated equipment.  This includes Building 891 and the FAA transformers in Building 724.
	The 914th AW and the 107th ARW maintain separate electrical distribution systems on the Niagara Falls ARS. The separate systems are connected at a switch located on the property line between the 107th ARW and the 914th AW. The switch is gang locked open to prevent the circuit from closing and causing injuries and damage to the electrical systems. 
	Niagara Mohawk supplies electric power at two different points on the installation for the general distribution systems.  Electricity is supplied to the 914th AW through the main switch adjacent to the base entrance on Lockport Road and to the 107th ARW through a switch adjacent to the Guardian Street entrance to the base, along Tuscarora Road. Base ownership of the electric facilities starts with the main switches. Electricity is delivered to both feeds at 13.2 kV.
	The primary electrical distribution system for the 914th AW consists of an overhead, three-phase, four-wire system rated at 13.2 kV. This system was installed in the 1990’s and completely replaced the old system with new poles, wires, transformers and switches. There are overhead primary circuit, overhead secondary circuit and underground secondary circuit. 
	The electrical distribution system on the 107th ARW is also new (constructed in the 1990’s). The primary electrical distribution system for the 107th ARW consists of underground primary, three phase circuits operating at 13.2kV, underground secondary circuit and primary circuit mounted overhead on new poles. Underground lines are protected by a duct-bank consisting of four conduits encased in concrete. One conduit carries power, one conduit carries fiber optic communication line, and two conduits are empty for future use.  Only the conduit carrying the electrical wires will be transferred to the new owner.
	Both systems are master metered with secondary meters located at various locations within the base for monitoring specific building use.
A third electrical supply point exists to supply electricity to the geographically separated area at the east end of the main runway.  Building 724 is the decommissioned pump station for a decommissioned water reservoir.  Building 724 also houses electrical circuits for the FAA runway lighting system.  Building 724  and the reservoir will be demolished after funding is approved.  Building 729 contains the water meter and backflow-preventer for the main water supply system from the City of Niagara Falls.   

Inventory for the system will be included in the RFP.

The RFP will be released on FedBizOpps on/around 03 Nov 08.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following Commercialitem/services:	The Orbital Debris Program Office (ODPO) at the National AeronauticalSpace Administration Johnson Space Center (NASA/JSC), in Houston, TX, in collaborationwith the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Detachment 15 on Maui, Hawaii, wish toprocure a Meter-Class Autonomous Telescope (MCAT) to be installed on the island of Legan,in the Kwajalein Atoll, with an expected installation date of July 2010. The telescope must meet specific performance criteria to qualify as an operationallyeffective tool for NASAs and AFRLs mission to characterize the orbital debrisenvironment.   This procurement will include the optical tube assembly; mounting; telescope controlsystem; component and system tests; factory integration; factory acceptance test; siteintegration; and site acceptance test. Characterization of the earth orbital object population is essential to the fulfillmentof NASAs mandate to promote civilian uses of the space environment. The characterizationinvolves generating a distribution function that primarily describes the number ofobjects of a given size, material type, physical shape, and orbital regime. Via a networkof radar and optical sensors, the orbital population is continually surveyed and acatalog of larger objects (&gt;10 cm diameter) is maintained by the Department ofDefense. The completeness of this correlated target" (CT) catalog [uncatalogedconstituents are labeled uncorrelated targets or (UCTs)] is limited both by thesensitivity of the assets employed and their geographic distribution. Most assets are athigher latitudes (&gt;30 N), which yields a paucity of low-inclination Low-Earth Orbit(LEO) target observations. Limited sensitivity means geosynchronous (GEO) observationsare also restricted to brighter targets.MCAT will employ a NASA supplied Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera to be used as theprimary detector. This backside illuminated, 4Kx4K, 15um pixel, 4-port camera is capableof both rapid framing for LEO acquisitions and low noise time exposures for GEO work.MCAT will be equipped with a Telescope Control System (TCS) incorporating both basicfunctionality and an open interface which allows for end user development of moresophisticated command and control. The base TCS will enable traditional pointing andtracking of both astronomical objects and CTs via supplied position and rate parameters.It will also operate MCAT autonomously by accommodating task lists containing targetsand/or search strategies for a nights observations. Ultimately, UCT stare and chasecapability will be developed by NASA to further enhance MCAT productivity.The following are minimum performance requirements needed to meet NASA's goals (1) todetect 10 cm targets at GEO in 5 second exposures, (2) to track LEO targets at analtitude of 200km, and (3) to create a survey fence with an adequate field of view andenough dwell time in the field for assessment and re-acquisition further along the track.The Field-of-View (FOV) needs to have a minimum width of 0.65 (0.92 diagonal). Utilizing the NASA supplied CCD detector, the telescope shall reach 21.5th  V-bandmagnitude in 5 seconds with a 20.5th mag/arcsec2  V-band sky brightness at a SNR of 2magnitudes above background. This corresponds to a 10-cm detection diameter at GEO(36,000 km) for a specular sphere with a 0.10 albedo.  A minimum 1.25m clear aperture isthus required.The telescope also has a requirement for an Equatorial Mount with:  high speed trackingto 2.2 deg/sec @ &lt;0.05% rate accuracy, sidereal tracking @ &lt;0.2 arcsec Root MeanSquare (RMS) jitter, &gt;4.0 deg/sec slewing, &gt;10 deg/sec2 acceleration, directencoded (modeled) pointing repeatable and stable to &lt;3 arcsec RMS, and a maximumallowable elevation obscuration of 10.5 @ 180 azimuth (allows 200 km, 0 inclinationLEOs to be observed due South) and &lt;25 @ 0 (North) azimuth. All hardware components of the MCAT must perform in an environment with these attributes: nominal temperature 70F to 90F, extremes of 60F to 100F, nominal operation up to 17knot wind, 70-90% relative humidity, sea-level; occasional salt mist, observatoryenclosure maximum 20 diameter.The anticipated release date of RFP is on or about September 22, 2008, with ananticipated proposal due date on or about October 6, 2008.All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.An ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Dawn C Rabunsky, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-0355, Fax 301-480-3432, Email drabunsk@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC><p>On behalf of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Westat, under the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS) Program, will be seeking proposals from all interested infectious disease test&nbsp; developers/manufacturers for refining, assembling, validating and obtaining FDA approval for HIV-SELECTEST EIA kits for distribution to national and international laboratories conducting blood donor screening in developing countries where HIV vaccination is likely to become prevalent. These kits will be used for distinguishing true HIV-1 infections from vaccine-induced HIV-1 antibody responses in blood donors.  Additional proposal requirements include plans for developing, refining, assembling, validating and FDA licensing a Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test based on the HIV-SELECTEST, which is presently being developed by FDA as a second generation HIV-SELECTEST.  For both tasks, work will be conducted in two stages to include preclinical studies/test refinement, and clinical trials/test validation.</p>
<p>For the development and subsequent manufacture of the HIV-SELECTEST EIA kits contractors will be responsible for preparing, purifying and testing the HIV-1 synthetic peptides to be used in the HIV-SELECTEST.  There are four peptide sequences, two for Gag p6 and two for gp41 EIA.  Verification of the specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility of the EIA must be conducted using commercially available serological reference panels, clinical specimens from HIV-1 vaccine trials, specimens from studies deemed as false positives or indeterminate based on FDA-licensed serological kits and Western Blot kits, specimens from HIV-1 epidemiological evaluations, and other studies with infectious agents relevant to HIV-1 infection.  Pre-clinical sensitivity and specificity study requirements for an IND will be provided.  Comparison and stability studies to define the sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and robustness of the HIV-SELECTEST EIA in detecting acute HIV-1 infections will be required.  For clinical trials/test validation, the contractor will be expected to ship and distribute kits to up to 20 national and international infectious disease screening laboratories supporting HIV-1 vaccine trials, which will conduct clinical testing of specimens obtained from Phase I-III clinical trials.  In conjunction with this, in-house parallel testing of 10-15% of these specimens being tested by infectious disease screening laboratories is required for QA/QC compliance and assessment of results variability across laboratories, variability across kit lots, and kit stability.  Finally, the contractor shall submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA.</p>
<p>Plans for the Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test should include refinement of the assay.  Given that this assay is presently being developed by FDA scientists as a second generation HIV-SELECTEST, the technology will be transferred to the contractor following the award.  Contractors will be required to compare the performances of the HIV-SELECTEST EIA, the Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test, and current FDA approved HIV-1 tests.  These comparison studies will test clinical specimens in parallel with participating regional and national testing laboratories that perform screening and confirmatory testing for blood donors that also contain specimens derived from centers supporting HIV-1 vaccine clinical trials.  To conduct the comparative studies the contractor will develop an External Quality Assurance program containing Standard Proficiency Testing Panels.  Upon completion of the testing the contractor will prepare and submit to the FDA a Premarket Approval (PMA) application.</p>
<p>This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition.  It is anticipated that one award will be made for a period of 3 years.  THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS NOT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP); the Request For Proposals must be downloaded from the Westat Web Site, and will be available on or about October 10, 2008 at the following internet address:  www.westat.com.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION /SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT /SOLE SOURCE NOTICE
The NPS anticipates soliciting a proposal from a single source, Gallatin County Montana, for composting services; however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the NPS. The NPS anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about 10/8/08 and awarding a contract in November, 2008. Copies of the solicitation may be obtained by submitting a request to john_chaney@nps.gov or fax 307-344-2079 by 10/8/08.
A)   Statement of Work:   The contract will include composting of YNP municipal solid waste and manure. The NPS has determined that due to transportation costs and environmental issues the composting facility should be located no more than 150 miles (one-way distance) from YNP's headquarters in Mammoth Hot Springs, WY.. The contract will not include the handling or transport of any hazardous materials. YNP personnel will transport the waste to the compost facility, year round, in 75 yard compactor trailers as well as collection trucks directly without using compactor trailers. The number of loads will vary, depending on the time of the year. During the summer months, up to 36 tons per day will be delivered. During the winter months, one 18 ton load will be delivered every seven to ten days. The contractor shall sort the municipal solid waste at the compost facility, separating compostable waste from non-compostable waste. Compostable waste is defined as all organic materials that meets or exceeds the specifications set forth by industry standards. The contractor shall process all compostable municipal solid waste with sewage sludge and manure into compost. The contractor shall store the processed compost in a climate controlled environment. The composting process must divert 85%, by weight, of the municipal solid waste from a land fill. The contractor shall dispose of all non-compostable solid waste at a licensed landfill. The contractor shall register their facility with the state and shall adhere to all federal and state solid waste regulations.
B)  Estimated Quantities:     2,500 tons of municipal solid waste and 335 tons of manure
C)  Anticipated Period of Performance:  1/1/09 - 9/30/09
D)  Proposed Contract Type:  Firm fixed price contract with unit pricing.
E)  Sole source justification, evaluation factors or contractor qualifications:The National Park Service has determined that disposal of waste within the park boundaries of Yellowstone National Park is not appropriate and that long distance transporting of the waste is neither practical nor environmentally appropriate. Analysis of the issue revealed that a significant amount of the waste was comprised of paper and food products.  Based upon the make-up of the waste it was determined that composting of the waste just outside of the Park provided the best means by which to address both the environmental and cost issues of disposing of the waste. The composting process would address the environmental issues surrounding waste disposal by diverting the majority of the waste from the landfill and providing a reusable byproduct. And by composting of the waste just outside of the Park's border YNP's waste disposal costs would be reduced due to the transportation costs. Thus, in 2001 the National Park Service (NPS) and several municipalities in southwest Montana began the process of planning, designing and constructing the Gallatin County composting facility in West Yellowstone, a community just outside of YNP's west entrance. In 2008 Congress recognized the significant importance of the Gallatin County composting facility to the operation of Yellowstone National Park and granted the National Park Service (NPS) authority to pay a significant portion of the cost to upgrade the composting facility for the specific purpose of processing and disposal of waste generated within Yellowstone National Park. Congress went on to elaborate on the continued use of the Gallatin County composting facility by the NPS given the capital contribution made by the NPS.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service is preparing to release a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for a performance based service contract to perform snow measurements. The RFQ will be released on or about 10/21/08, with the award of one or more contracts on or about 11/28/08. The successful contractor(s) will travel to the designated mountainous survey sites and take snow, precipitation, and other related measurements in accordance with the RFQ. The sites can only be accessed by snowmobiles or helicopters (few by foot identified in Statement of Work). The contractor(s) will report the data back to the contracting officer’s representative. The contractor will be paid based on whether the specifications were exceeded (110% of the quote per survey), met (100% of the quote per survey), or not met (90% of the quote per survey). The government will only pay for surveys that are completed. Surveys are divided into 4 groups for locations around western Montana. Contractors may choose to submit quotes for one or more groups. Contracts will be issued to the contractor(s) whose offer represents the best value to the government. There are two one-year renewal options for the government based on performance. Contractors are required to have satisfactorily completed training in the snow sampling and winter survival portion of the Westwide Snow Survey Training School.  This year the training is scheduled for January 11 through 16, 2009 at the Granlibakken Resort in Lake Tahoe. The training will be at the contractor’s expense.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement      for vendor Synthes, USA to provide items for instrumentation and implants needed for trauma fixation of the femur, humerus, distal tibia and distal radius along with compression and cannulated screws to coordinate with our existing Synthes systems.  It is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.  Inquires/information received after established deadline of September 29, 2008 shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETIONVendor Synthes, USA to provide VA with items for instrumentation and implants of TI Instruments.  The VA currently own sets of Synthes trauma instrumentation and equipment.  1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activityBoston VA Healthcare System  Operating Room, West Roxbury, MA2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.Sole Source procurement service contract for Synthes, USA.3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value).Synthes equipment and implants including Femoral nail system, Humeral system, Distal Tibial, Distal Radius systems, Compression screws and cannulated screws.  Estimated value $241,853.75.4.	Identification of the statutory authority permitting other then full and open competition.FAR Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source.5.	      Demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. These Synthes sets are designed to coordinate with our current inventory of Synthes trauma instrumentation and equipment.  We currently have over thirty six Synthes sets used in conjunction with one another to provide optimum patient care.  The Jamaica Plain operating room presently uses some of this instrumentation and we need to standardize all possible kits.  This will ensure that our equipment is interchangeable since we need to borrow their equipment when we have multiple cases of the same type and as a backup.	Presently Synthes is the primary trauma vendor at our facility.  Over the past several years we have worked very hard with the nursing staff and orthopedic surgeons to set up a system that is efficient and user friendly.  As a result there has been increased satisficaction by both the nursing staff and the surgeons.  Delays have been reduced, since we do not have to borrow the instrument and emergency releases for implants, and enhanced patient care has been achieved.	The requested instrumentation is designed to coordinate and compliment our current kits.  The precontured plates, for example, will be used with our existing small fragment locking system.  This will address an increasing need for this type of plate, for problem fractures, that has evolved over the past few years.  The femoral nailing system will upgrade our current set to be in line with the current technology and provide optimum state of the art care to our patients requiring this type of intervention.  The other intermudullary systems will do this as well.  The compression screws and cannulated screws will increase and augment our current inventory to provide the best possible care to our veterans.	The proposed additions to our current Synthes inventory of orthopedic systems have been required by the orthopedic surgeons to help make their job easier and enhance the care that they will be able to provide to our patients.  This will also benefit the operating room nursing staff since they are very familiar with our current Synthes instrumentation.	To add other companys instrumentation and implants to our current inventory would not make fiscal or practical sense.1)	It will require the additional purchase of tens of thousands dollars of instrumentation, duplicating what we already have in our Synthes inventory, to coordinate with this new equipment;2)	The new equipment would not interchange with what we currently have on hand;3)	The inventory is a must in order to put the equipment into service;4)	The surgeons would be reluctant to use another system since using multiple implant systems on a patients would create potential harm and may constitute plate/implant failure in  patients;5)	Last but not less, this would result in a very significant expenditure that would for the unused inventory.	The West Roxbury operating room has made a significant effort to provide excellent trauma care to our veterans.  The enhancements to our Synthes systems have made the workload of the surgeons and the operating room staff easier.  The familiarity of using the same orthopedic systems translates to better patient care and time efficiency.  This again leads to increasing OR flow, decreasing OR delays and saving money in the operating room usage time.	The Synthes company provides state of the art trauma systems for our patients care.  Adding to our current inventory of over thirty six existing instrumentation and implant sets designed to efficiently coordinate and work together makes both fiscal and practical sense.  This will help us to provide optimum, safe patient care.6.	Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily Notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.Only provider of parts for this equipment.This requirement is expected to exceed $25,000 and in accordance with FAR 5.201(b) (1) a notice will be posted through FBO.7.	Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable:As contracting officer, I certify the cost is fair and reasonable, and advantageous to the government.8.       Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:	No other firms were contacted.  Contractor Synthes, USA has the expertise, qualification and experience to provide quality service per the government requirements9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, or engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available: 	The West Roxbury VA currently owns and uses over thirty six trauma instrumentation and implant kits.  These kits are designed to work together and coordinate with each other.  The purchase of this type of trauma instrumentation and implants from other companies would require the addition purchase of the additional instrumentation.  In other word, it will increase the cost.	The Synthes company provides excellent trauma instrumentation for optimum patient care and excellent service provided by the Synthes representative.10.	A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:None to Date.11.	A statement of the actions, if any the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:The contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.    Statement of WorkVendor is to provide items for instruments and implants needed for Synthes equipment and implants including Femoral nail system, Humeral system, Distal Tibial, Distal Radius systems, Compression screws and Cannulated screws.SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTSSECTION BPUBLISH TO FBO:    WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2008 10:00 AM EST FOR 5 DAYS;DEADLINE:          MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2008 10:00 AM EST.

<DESC>Please reference Request for Proposal Number VA-791-08-RP-0058.  THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR POTENTIAL OFFERORS AND CONTINUE MARKET RESEARCH OF POTENTIAL SOURCES.  ANY SOLICITATION FOR THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE ISSUED AT A LATER DATE.  The Veterans Administration (VA), Denver Acquisition and Logistics Center, 155 Van Gordon St, Lakewood, CO, 80228, is contemplating a soliciting for proposals from well qualified and experienced sources from any size business who is capable of providing Assistance and Advisory Services (A&AS) for the review, analysis, and development of the Veterans Affairs (VA) Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center (PRC) Assistive Technology Labs programs located at the VA's four VA PRCs in Richmond, VA; Tampa, FL; Palo Alto, CA; and Minneapolis, MN.  The PRCs serve some of the most severely injured veterans and active duty service members.  Due to the severity of their injuries, these individuals often suffer long-term physical, cognitive, and psychosocial disabilities that impact their ability to live independently and to participate in everyday community activities.  These difficulties can be alleviated with the use of Assistive Technology (AT), which has been shown to be effective in increasing access to or participation in employment options, education, and independent living.  Clinical providers at the PRCs are actively involved in fitting and prescribing AT devices and services for veterans and service members with disabilities.  They have access to the most advanced rehabilitation equipment and devices.  At the same time, there is an urgent need to guide existing efforts and develop a coherent, standardized program for all aspects of AT service delivery at the PRCs, including clinical services, outreach, education, and outcomes management.  This goal can be achieved through the development and standardization of processes within the AT Labs at the PRCs.  The mission of the AT Labs at the VA PRCs is to effectively support veterans and active duty service members with cognitive, sensory, and/or physical disabilities to reach their highest potential at home, school, and work through the addition of appropriate assistive technologies to their lives.  The successful offeror will be required to provide all resources necessary to accomplish the program review, analysis, and development services, submission of proposed standardized program to the VA, training of VA personnel in adopted processes, and documentation requirements contained within the VA Statement of Objectives (SOO), as further delineated in the offeror's proposed Performance Work Statement (PWS), which will be incorporated into the contract.  This contract will include the eleven milestones described below with their associated deliverables to be completed as requirements of this SOO.  Those milestones are; 1) Initialize Project; 2) Develop Design Plan for AT Labs; 3) Develop Work Plan; 4) Develop Payment Schedule; 5) Provide Educational Services; 6) Provide Standardized Procedures for Evaluation; 7) Provide Consultation Services; 8) Provide Evaluation of AT Devices; 9) Develop AT Outcomes Data Collection and Management; 10) Provide Briefings to VA key personnel and management; 11) Provide Final Report.  The successful offeror will include a Performance Work Statement, proposed costs to be based upon completion of milestones/deliverables, and estimated travel costs in their proposals.  Important note: successful contractor will be reviewing and analyzing processes and staff training requirements, and then presenting an AT program for acceptance and implementation within the PRC's.  There will be no direct patient care or access to patient records.  Although offerors will propose a completion schedule for this project in their RFP response, the VA estimates project duration at between 18 to 36 months.  Subject procurement is being procured as a commercial item as defined by FAR Part 12. Subject contract award will be made in accordance with FAR Parts 13 and 15. Subject announcement is provided in order to satisfy the requirements of FAR Part 5. The North American Classification Code is 622310 (Specialty (except Psychiatric and Substance Abuse) Hospitals) and Small Business Size Standard is $31.5 million. The potential requirement package will likely be issued as a 'full and open' solicitation for any and all qualified, experienced, and knowledgeable educational or business entity who can meet the requirements for this type of process review, analysis, and training A&AS project.  All qualified, eligible and responsible sources may submit a timely proposal in response to the solicitation for consideration of award. The VA will be issuing a Request for Proposals in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. This acquisition will be procured as a 'Best Value' type of acquisition where price and technical superiority allow for evaluation trade-offs to achieve the best value contract for the government.  Non-price factors (technical proposal, past performance, and subcontracting opportunities), when combined, will be considered significantly more important than price. Solicitation documents will be available electronically on or about October 15, 2008 at the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. NO HARD COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. The anticipated RFP closing date is estimated to be on or about December 2, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. (Mountain Time). Upon review of the solicitation documents, prospective offerors are encouraged to provide questions and/or comments, in writing, in regards to the solicitation documents prior to submission of a proposal. A pre-proposal conference is anticipated in Denver, CO, on October 23, 2008.  Both in-person and tele-conference attendees may be permitted based on feedback from potential respondents to the solicitation.  Please review solicitation for conference details once the document is issued.  The Contracting Officer for this acquisition is Mr. Ray Blomquist (ray.blomquist@va.gov). Please submit questions via e-mail, no phone calls please. Interested firms are reminded that in accordance with FAR Part 4.11, prospective contractors are required to have an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and FAR Part 4.12, prospective contractors must complete electronic on line annual representations and certifications (ORCA) databases prior to award of a contract and can be accessed at the Business Partner Network (BPN) website at http://www.bpn.gov/.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) intends to award a sole source contract to Hemedex Inc. 222 Third Street, Cambridge, MA  02142 for the purchase of Bowman Perfusion Monitor Model 500 devices (3), QFLOW 500 Probes (3+) and Fixation Devices (3+).To support needed VAPHS requirements, the Bowman Perfusion Monitor, Model 500, is the first commercially available device that monitors tissue blood flow continuously at the capillary level in real time and absolute units of ml/100g-min.  The Bowman Perfusion Monitor utilizes a proprietary thermal diffusion technology through its minimally-invasive, QFlow 500 Probe, which physicians can implant in any target soft tissue.  To the best of our knowledge it is the only commercially available device that performs these functions.Prior to the Bowman system, the ability to get continuous, real time perfusion measurements in absolute units (ml/100g-min) did not exist. These measurements are a long sought after and important parameter in understanding and managing critical medical situations. Data from the Bowman Perfusion Monitor allows physicians to develop and implement effective treatments quickly, creating the potential to improve patient outcomes and lower costsThe sole source acquisition is enacted in accordance with existing authority under FAR 6.302-1.The period of performance will begin on 30, September 2008.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this acquisition are 339112 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responsible sources interested in this procurement shall submit on their company letterhead a statement, which contains clear and convincing information identifying their capabilities to provide the service.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in writing no later than 1:30 pm local time, September 29, 2008 to Phil Crichlow, via email at Philmore.CrichlowJr@va.gov or mail information to VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (90C-H), Attention, Phil Crichlow, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15206.

The US Army Project Manager for PM Command Posts (formerly Tactical Radio Communication Systems) is conducting market research to identify potential qualified vendors capable of providing technical services and support of U.S. Army Mission Critical Communication Equipment and Systems Acquisition Management Support.  

An anticipated contract will be a 5 year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) vehicle that provides engineering and technical services in support of U.S. Army mission-critical communication equipment and systems.  Services include: system engineering, software engineering, logistics support, fielding support and training support, as well as unique depot repair and test bed capabilities required to support mission-critical communication equipment and systems.  

The equipment delineated further below are all part of the Mission Critical Defense System (MCDS).  These equipments are used by the Joint Services, primarily the Army. The hardware/software designs and configurations for these systems are technically complex and dynamic due to the rapidly changing military communications environment.  Remote Training and other applicable peripheral/interface devices and equipment will be included for all future upgrades.  Requirements are specified for the physical establishment, utilization, management, control inclusive of a contractor maintenance support of a Test Facility for these systems at a contractor designated location.  Government objectives and requirements are for the establishment and performance by the contractor of necessary program management and control (cost, task execution and schedule factors), for the performance of software quality assurance management and for the configuration management functions of the MCDS equipments.  The Government does not own the data rights and therefore can not organically support these MCDS systems at this time. 

The supported MCDS systems and equipment include, but are not limited to High Mobility DGM (Digital Group Multiplexer) Assemblages (HMDA) / HS(High Speed) HMDA,  AN/TTC/TYC-39 Switch, AN/TTC-56 Single Shelter Switch (SSS) and MSE Family of Switches, Compact Digital Switch (CDS), Switch Multiplexer Unit (SMU), Line Termination Unit (LTU), Vantage, Single Row Nest (SRN) switch components, and derivative variants such as Baseband Node (BBN), Network Operations Center Vehicle (NOCV) and  Tactical High Speed Data Network (THSDN)).  This equipment operates Mobile Subscriber Equipment and its derivative systems (communications networks) which are crucial to Army global communications.  

Key technical and program management criteria are established based on the primary capability requirement of potential contractors to perform the technical efforts identified in the Government’s draft Statement of Work (SOW).  Criteria elements that will be utilized in an evaluation are Program Management, System Engineering, Logistics Support, Software Engineering, Training Devices Upgrade, Fielding Support, Depot Support and Testing Support.  

An anticipated 5 year IDIQ contract Period of Performance is projected to be on or about 27 August 2008 for a three-year base period between 28 August 2008 – 27 August 2011 and two additional one-year options for continued services.  The POP will facilitate continued coverage of essential technical support for mission-critical communications equipment used by the Army, as well as the Joint Services.   Tasks may be placed under this IDIQ contract as needed on a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) or Time and Materials (T&M) basis. 

Any and each potential contractor response to the FedBizOps sources sought announcement will be reviewed to assess the extent to which the contractor’s current technical and management capabilities, as well as past performance, would enable the contractor to perform the key program management and technical tasks identified by the criteria elements indicated above.  Possible subcontracting opportunities to a prime vendor are unknown at this time.

Any interest should be conveyed with a title page containing the vendor name, date, and the name and telephone number of the author and/or other points of contact. A description should provide evidence of vendor experience and briefly summarize the capabilities to support above cited systems.  A description should also reflect the vendor's previous demonstrated performance in managing and supporting similar systems comparable in size and complexity. Vendors must provide all such information in writing.  
Questions and/or comments regarding this notice and SOW may be submitted via e-mail to charles.ade@gsa.gov or charm.yeung@gsa.gov.  Verbal questions and/or comments will NOT be accepted.

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION:  The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as CONFIDENTIAL under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<BR><BR>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) CONFIDENTIAL with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<BR><BR>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as CONFIDENTIAL may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR><BR>3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Governments rights in the data.<BR><BR>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: and CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS.<BR><BR>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR>6.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), University Drive C Division, intends to negotiate a sole source procurement pursuant to  FAR 6.302-1 with  Buffalo Supply , 5900 A Coal Creek Drive, Lafayette, CO  80026 for  (5 ea)  "The Bone Mill",   Manufactured by Stryker, Product 5400-700-000, (5ea) 5400-701-000, Bone Mill Medium Blade 5.0, (5 ea) Bone Mill Medium Blade 3.2, (5 ea) 5400-705-000 The Mill Sterilization Case, and (5ea) 5400-704-000 The Mill Hand piece Cable.The Stryker Bone Mill is designed for a uniform  consistent bone yield producing the same size particulate every time which aids in a more successful fusion.  Simple pass cutting action allows for lower temperature bone exposure that also results in better fusion rate.  The different blade sizes allow for different sized bone particulate and desired bone granulation.  This bone mill allows the scrub tech to crush the bone in 15-20 seconds which enables the technician to focus on assisting the surgeon on other aspects of the procedure as opposed to crushing the bone manually.Firms who wish to identify their interest and capability to provide an alternate system which will meet the capabilities and functionality described above may notify the Contracting Officer, by e-mail at cassandra.craven@va.gov. (412) 954-4022 no later than 4:00pm EST September 26, 2008.    Such notification must include a complete description of proposed equipment including a narrative and specifications, and must demonstrate that it meets or exceeds the capabilities described above.  Upon receipt of any such notifications, the contracting officer will determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with the sole source negotiations.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposal.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A QUOTE.  A
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND QUOTES WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Institutes of Health intends to issue a purchase order
on a sole source basis with:  The World Health Organization ., Geneva, Switzerland.
No solicitations exist for this requirement.  The service is commercial as defined
in FAR Part 2.  The total contracted dollar amount will not exceed the Simplified
Acquisition Threshold; therefore it will be procured under FAR 13.106.  It is
believed that The World Health Organization is he sole source for this requirement
under the authority of FAR parts 13.106-1 (b) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1.  
The World Health Organization in conjunction with the Sloan-Kettering
Foundation and the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA), is sponsoring
a meeting.  Due to the location, it would be cost prohibitive for OBA to use its
existing logistical support contractor for such a task since it would require oversees
coordination with the WHO and providing travel and per diem cost for a contractor to be onsite.  A Statement of Work is attached to this notice.  The North American 
Industry Classification System is 541720 and the size standard is $7,000.00.  This
notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes preparation.  No
solicitation document exists.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated
capability within the established time frame is invited to submit written notification
to the Contract Specialist by September 29th , 2008 at 1pm EST.  Supporting
evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm’s 
ability to provide the stated capability.  Information can be sent to the Contract
Specialist, Aleise Roberts at aleiser@od.nih.gov .  No telephone request will be
accepted.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the
Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to
this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, NIH will proceed with the sole source purchase order.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), California Bay Delta Authority (CALFED), located in Sacramento, CA, intends to establish a labor-hours contract with a base year plus one option year (12 months), for the purpose of obtaining scientific research advisory and assistance services on the Suisun Marsh Preservation Agreement from Dr. Stuart Siegel of Wetlands and Water Resources, Inc. The Suisun Marsh Charter Group (SMCG) Principal Agencies (Principals), composed of Federal, State and local agencies, are preparing "The Habitat Management, Preservation, and Restoration Plan for the Suisun Marsh" (SMP) which will balance the goals and objectives of the CALFED Bay-Delta Program, Suisun Marsh Preservation Agreement, and other management and restoration programs within the Suisun Marsh in a manner responsive to the concerns of all stakeholders. The role of the SMP Science Advisor is to advise the Principals, and conduct tasks as directed by the Principals, to help ensure the application of good scientific practices into the development of the SMP and its Programmatic EIS/EIR, assist in broadening the scientific knowledge about the marsh, and help integrate scientific expertise and peer-review into the planning and implementation processes and activities.
The purpose of this work is to continue Science Advisor participation through to completion of the Final PEIR/S. Since beginning work on the SMP, the PEIR/S schedule has extended, its and the Plan's contents have expanded as the agencies clarified Plan direction during its preparation. In addition, work on the SMP was set originally to conclude by September 2008 coincident with the scheduled expiration of its underlying contract. That contract timeline has recently been extended to accommodate broader CALFED activities.
This requirement will be awarded to Dr. Stuart Siegel, Wetlands and Water Resources, Inc, of San Rafael, CA, on a sole source basis for the following reasons: Dr. Siegel possesses extensive experience in the design, construction, and management of wetland ecosystems and has participated in past multi-agency, large-scale restoration endeavors including the South Bay Salt Pond Project and the Delta Regional Ecosystem Restoration Implementation Plan. He has also provided scientific guidance to the Delta Vision Blue Ribbon Task Force through his work on the Ecosystem Work Group. Dr. Siegel has demonstrated an ability to lead local and regional scientists and managers through complex scientific results and is highly respected and consulted for his technical expertise in the area of habitat restoration. Dr. Siegel has served as the Suisun Marsh Science Advisor since 2006. Previous participation in SMP activities is essential to providing the scientific integrity of the development of the Suisun Marsh Plan from the Science Advisor position. The institutional knowledge and expertise held by Dr. Siegel as the Science Advisor for SMP is critical to the timeline of the project and necessary to perform the duties of the position. Stuart Siegel has historical knowledge of this position, this project and the required expertise in tidal wetland ecology and marsh restoration. 
The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with St. Jude Medical Inc. under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.Electrophysiology Laboratory, Medical Service, V.A. Boston Healthcare System, West Roxbury, MA                         2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.Respectfully request the procurement of an U.S. Field Installation Kit for the EnSite Electro-anatomical Cardiac Mapping System. This software Registration Module enhances the existing hardware with Fusion capacity. The EnSite Fusion Kit and the Assurance Plus Warranty is solely available from St. Jude Medical, Saint Paul MN.                    3. Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).This sophisticated software upgrade enhances a complex Electrophysiology Cardiac Mapping System which is already on station and in frequent demand for use in the Medical Service Division of the V.A. Boston Healthcare System. The EnSite Fusion Dynamic Registration feature enables the operating physician to optimize the anatomical fit acquired from the EnSite NavX cardiac navigation field to the CT model, providing precise delineation of dynamic cardio-thoracic anatomy in real-time interventional procedural settings.   Comprehensive registration to the cardiac model is facilitated through Lesion Application, Anatomical Labeling, Voltage and/or Latency Activation Mapping as well as through Complex Fractionated Cardiac Potential Mapping, all resultant to this requested EnSite Fusion software upgrade.As an alternative to rigid cardiac registration systems, the EnSite Fusion upgrade offers Dynamic Registration, providing the Attending Medical Physician to actively make dynamic adjustments for size and shape of EnSite NavX anatomical field to precisely fit a 3-D CT Scan, a beneficial feature not available from alternative sources. Maximal system operating function is a unique by-product the Registration Tool upgrade brings to the St. Jude Medical EnSite Fusion Registration Module. St. Jude Medical S.C., Incorporated is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the EnSite NavX Fusion Registration Module. St. Jude Medical maintains sole proprietary rights to this software system upgrade. Failure to utilize this sophisticated software upgrade has the potential to adversely effect patient care and procedural outcomes, potentially resulting in patient mortality or worsening existing medical condition secondary to protracted procedural times. This purchase is advantageous to V.A. Boston Healthcare System.(Estimated Cost: $59,075.00)	4. Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.FAR 6.302-1    ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.The EnSite Fusion enhancement utilizes an EnSite NavX System DWS3 and version 7.0.1 field-scaled, multi-surface model as the base for registry with this level of detail and accuracy, facilitating system operation. The existing EnSite NavX Cardiac Mapping System currently possess these specifications, minimizing acquisition costs while providing a more intuitive electro-anatomical cardiac mapping system in the provision of optimal patient care under deleterious therapeutic interventions. EnSite Fusion precision facilitates transition between registered cardiac models and EnSite geometries while retaining acquired data. System function is maximized subsequent to software upgrade providing display of electrical information and labeling model facilitating medical diagnosis and efficacious treatment. Fiduciary diagnostic landmark mapping functions, including the MultiPoint Data Collection feature is inclusive of the entire range of cardiac maps appearing on the registered model. The EnSite Fusion Cardiac Navigation System allows for the most detailed mapping of cardiac anatomy available for the precise electrophysiologic interventional procedures performed in the E.P. Laboratory today, providing an unsurpassed technological advantage which is efficient, safe and informative. St. Jude Medical is the only vendor who makes and can provide this specific therapeutic software upgrade. 6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are  solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  a.)	Biosense-Webster, Incorporated.b.)	Boston Scientific Corporation.c.)	Medtronic Corporation.7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable.Determination was conducted and the anticipated cost to the government is fair and reasonable based on commercial price for products would be $69,500.00 a discounted price for the government @ 15% total being of purchase is $59,075.00	8. Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.A market survey was not conducted due to the fact that this is the only system currently available on the market capable of being used for our specific needs. These details of these unique features are described under 3 above.9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.Equipment previously procured, readily available and frequently utilized for complex ablative interventional procedures meets specifications for EnSite Fusion Registration Module with Dynamic Registration software upgrade, minimizing cost of this acquisition.The Medical Director of the Electrophysiology Laboratory has demonstrated the exponential increase of complex therapeutic procedures provided to the VISN 1 Veteran patient population in successful treatment of Congestive Heart Failure, CHF and Paroxysmal and Persistent Atrial Fibrillation, AF. As the primary referral center for Electrophysiology Services in VISN 1, this software acquisition promotes stateof-the-art care to care for the people who have served. The EnSite Fusion upgrade facilitates provision of patient care with the hope of minimizing increased morbidity and acute hospitalizations for the treatment of CHF and AF.10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.None only one available source11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.Contracting Activity will continue to encourage brand name or equivalent specifications.

WAWF-RA will simplify your Government invoicing process, allow you to monitor you payment status online, and ensure faster payment transactions for your company. WAWF-RA is a web-based program and is available at no cost to your company. For assistance with WAWF, please call 1-866-618-5988. To register your company for WAWF, simply log into https://wawf.eb.mil. Step-by-step instructions on how to register and how to submit invoices through WAWF-RA are outlined at https://rmb.ogden.disa.mil.

YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUTE DAILY TO THE PERSONNEL SECURITY BRANCH OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, DC

Description

OPM has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on prospective ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.  The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.  ATF will provide these regulations to the Contractor.

ATF realizes there is a need to secure the services of persons possessing certain degrees of expertise in the processing of background investigations, including planning, scoping, assigning and reviewing.  To that end, ATF has a need for “In-House Special Investigators,” hereinafter referred to as contractors.  ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

Contract investigators who are under contract with ATF shall be known as “Special Investigators” and carry credentials authorizing them to perform such background investigations as the Assistant Director may authorize.  Contractors may also be assigned to assist with other official ATF investigations.

Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them.  Such tasks might include planning assignments, scoping investigations, assigning investigations, reviewing Reports of Investigation (ROI), auditing and adjudicating investigations, completing invoices for payment for the investigation and working on special projects as directed by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) and/or Branch Chief.  Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors’ duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Contractors will be paid at the rate of $54.50 per hour. Hours authorized and worked in excess of 40 hours per week will be paid at the rate of $81.75; the need for additional work hours must be agreed upon and have prior approval from the COTR and/or Branch Chief.  Contractors shall ensure their availability to process needed work in a timely manner.  A minimum of 32 hours per week is required.  Contractors are responsible for providing adequate office coverage with their respective team; to include holiday and high vacation/travel months.  Failure to meet necessary availability may result in termination of the contract. 

In compliance with ATF’s specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractor’s invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work. 

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  

Contractors are responsible for safeguarding information.  Background investigation information is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 and, unless classified, is considered Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) (also or formerly known as Sensitive but Unclassified information). CUI must not be transmitted via unsecured email or Internet, or disclosed to unauthorized parties.  Contractors must never furnish or divulge CUI contained in an investigation.  Each contractor must make every reasonable effort to protect data associated with a background investigation.  Data, notes, copies of testimonies, copies of ROIs, etc., are the sole property of ATF and must be safeguarded against unlawful disclosure.  

Each contractor shall execute a MOU, attesting to his or her understanding of this section, which, upon execution, will become a permanent part of this contract.  Contractors will have access to ATF’s computer network and are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.  Contractors must also complete the following forms: ATF P 7500.1 (Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users), ATF F 2030.1 (Personnel Authenticator Locator), ATF F 1710.5 (Request for Media ID), and Social Engineering Certification.  

Identification media, ATF-provided software, and all other Government property must be surrendered when requested by the PSB. 

Each contractor must be able to obtain and maintain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and receive a Top Secret clearance.  This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the PSB, and be performed under such standards as the PSB may establish.  A favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF information, information technology systems, and unescorted access to facilities.  Failure to have a background investigation favorably adjudicated SSBI or receive a Top Secret clearance constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. The contractor is responsible for making changes to his/her own information.  Any changes to the contractor’s name, address, telephone number, company name, tax identification number, or financial institution information must be made by the contractor in the CCR.  The CCR is used to process electronic payment deposits.  It is vital contractors keep their registration current.  In addition, contractors must notify the PSB and the ATF Financial Management Division of any changes so the proper updates can be made to all systems.  

Each contractor, when working in the PSB, must carry themselves in a manner that reflects positively on ATF.  To that end, contractors, when on duty, should present themselves in a professional manner, be neatly groomed, and appropriately attired.  Complaints of inappropriate conduct or performance will be investigated, and if substantiated, may result in the contract being terminated.

Contractors must exhibit professional qualities during all periods of performance and absolute integrity is required and expected.  Contractors must be polite and professional in both conduct and appearance.

Contractors should never use ATF credentials for investigating any matter not assigned to them by ATF, PSB or for any personal gain.  Contractors must not allow their credentials to be photocopied or taken from their possession.  Lost or stolen credentials should be reported to the PSB immediately, as well as the local police department.

ATF intends to issue vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  The solicitation will close October 8, 2008 at 4 p.m. EST.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors.  A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably.  Because ATF’s needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation add new contractors to the pool.  

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminate the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The BPA and the contractor’s responsibilities thereunder are subject changes in Federal law, regulation and policy, which may include, but are not limited to, procedural changes related to the use of government equipment, security procedures and investigative priorities.  Modifications may be sent to vendors via mail or electronic mail.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.

The following clauses are incorporated in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror – Commercial Items (Oct. 00)  and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference)  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items;  A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications- can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far. The Contractor may request a copy from SIAdministration@atf.gov.  Offeror shall provide a statement proving they have read and understand the term and Conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendor’s acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as “passed” will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 68 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores.  At least 56 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance and 12 must come from Vendor Capabilities.

A. Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance (80 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendor’s experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendor’s communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendor’s customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor’s performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases.  Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.
(56 points minimum).

B. Capabilities (20 Points):  Capabilities are the vendor’s ability to adhere to agency and program requirements. (12 points minimum).

C. Acceptability: ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a “pass” or “fail” basis.  A vendor’s offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor’s assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

It has been determined that the Strong Dental Digital Dental Radiographic Barrier System is the only system capable of meeting this requirement of the Dix-Mills Dental Clinic.  In order to protect the patient from exposure to disease and to protect the expensive digital sensors, a barrier sleeve system is always used while doing any type of intraoral denistry.  In the case of the Army's needs for quick and safe deployment of soldiers, the Army has chosen the Strong Dental all-in-one barrier sleeve, comfort cushion, positioning devices.  This combination system is the only one made to the best of DSCP's knowledge.  No other suppliers of this type of Barrier system to protect the patient and to protect the expensive sensors are known by DSCP.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information in response to this notice via email to the address listed below, no later than September 26, 2008 at 12:00PM EST.  If no responses are recieved by September 26, 2008 at 12:00PM EST, a contract with Strong Dental will be pursued.  The POC for this procurement is Jackie Hartzell at (215) 737-7944, FAX (215) 737-8002, email:  Jaclyn.Hartzell@dla.mil.

Interested parties are required to submit a proposal consistent with the factors identified in the proposal evaluation criteria section of this BAA. The purpose of the proposal is to evaluate an offeror's qualifications as a BATTNET Partner.  A STP is required from the offeror as part of the proposal, and will be technically evaluated.  An offeror’s STP must be evaluated as technically acceptable for the offeror to be eligible to receive a Partner Contract.   Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of at least $1 million per year is planned during Fiscal Years 2009-2015. This investment will be for funding of Partner Contracts and future STPs.  The Government has established cost targets providing up to $25,000 per year to each Partner for participating/coordinating in the process of the overall technical strategy, management, and reporting progress. Partner Contracts are anticipated to be awarded in FY09. STPs will not be awarded/funded at time of Partner Contract award issuance.  STPs will be considered for funding in FY 09 with awards anticipated in FY09/FY10.  The BAA is expected to result in Partner Contract(s) for research and development services, indefinite quantity type cost contract(s) which will provide flexibility for issuing funded delivery orders for STPs.  


This is an unrestricted acquisition. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by DLA. DLA encourages industry, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) and minority institutions (MI) to submit proposals under this BAA.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in this technology.  For purposes of this acquisition, the small business size standard is 500 employees and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. 

3. PROGRAM INFORMATION
BATTNET is a “community of practice” engaging research Partners with the diverse collection of government agencies and programs that oversee and administer the development, production and distribution of military batteries. All of the participants meet at regularly scheduled workshops. They work collaboratively to identify problems and needed improvements and to define solutions. Research solutions are demonstrated and implemented through STPs conducted by a collaboration of Partners and overseen by the appropriate government representatives.

4. BATTNET STRUCTURE:
The BATTNET program is made up of Partners who participate in workshops and engage in STPs under the oversight of the Government Steering Group (GSG). STP development and reviews are performed at BATTNET Workshops.

	A. PARTNERS
DLA contemplates awarding up to 10 Partner Contracts as the result of this BAA. The period of performance of the Partner Contract is expected to be 7 years with a 3-year base period and four 1-year option periods. Partners chosen to participate will receive an estimated amount of up to $25,000 per calendar year for authorized travel and related costs to attend and actively participate in BATTNET workshops and other Government sponsored meetings. All Partners shall be required to attend BATTNET sponsored meetings. Each Partner is required to bring specific technical expertise that lends itself to significant improvements of the battery industry’s ability to meet DLA and warfighter battery supply chain needs. The focus of BATTNET is for all Partners to actively and continuously assist DLA in improving its ability to meet/exceed a varying range of military requirements through research, development, and technology transfer efforts as they apply to batteries and related industries.

	B. GOVERNMENT STEERING GROUP (GSG)
The GSG oversees all BATTNET activities. It is made up of government representatives from the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Army, Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and Defense Logistics Agency. Membership may change over time to reflect the needs of the warfighter.

	C. WORKSHOPS AND MEETINGS
The BATTNET Partners and the GSG meet a minimum of four (4) times a year at workshops to review ongoing STPs, identify new areas for BATTNET investment, review proposed STPs, review BATTNET procedures and processes, keep abreast of new technologies, and understand DLA and Service battery needs and requirements. Additional BATTNET meetings may be scheduled as needed.

	D. SHORT TERM PROJECTS (STPs)
BATTNET research is done through the award of STPs that develop and adapt modern processes to be implemented within the battery supply chain to assure the prompt and sustained availability, quality, and affordability of batteries. STPs have an expected duration of 18-24 months and an average funding level of $100K-$250K per year. All STP proposals are required to include a business case, developed in advance, with specific metrics for success as well as a predicted return on investment (ROI), where applicable.  All BATTNET STPs shall have one or more Partners and a government sponsor to assure that:
1)	All BATTNET STPs shall be fully documented;
2)	All projects shall have the potential for implementation/transition; and
3)	All projects shall address a specific DLA/DOD need.

5.  EVALUATION CRITERIA  
It is the Government's intention to award Partner Contracts based upon proposals that demonstrate knowledge, experience, and expertise in the areas of interest identified below.  Proposals must be evaluated as technically acceptable under the criteria listed below to be eligible for a Partner Contract. The Partner proposal must demonstrate an understanding in one or more of those areas of interest, or an area directly related to but not listed.  The proposal should include novel approaches that are practical to implement; i.e., it is practical for DLA to affect internal methodology or provide R&D funding for specific technical efforts, but it is not practical to change laws or policies of agencies outside of DLA.   The Government plans to issue Partner Contracts to offerors submitting proposals that offer the most benefit to the Government.  

Teaming is acceptable. Proposers should provide full contact information for all team members.  Only proposals that fully comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will be considered.

Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. 

To be eligible for award of a Partner Contract, an offeror must have an adequate accounting system for a cost type contract, be determined technically acceptable in the Technical Proposal evaluation, and be determined responsible.  For additional information and guidance concerning qualifications and standards for responsibility of prospective contractors, please refer to Part 9 of the FAR. 
 
The Government reserves the right to award Partner Contracts to all, some, or none of the offerors.  In addition, the award of a Partner Contract does not imply that the STP submitted will be funded or implemented after the Partner Contract is awarded.  STP awards will occur only after review and evaluation by the BATTNET participants at scheduled workshops.  

The below evaluation criteria will be used for the Partner Contracts (which includes the required initial STP) and for evaluation of STPs proposed during the life of the contract (including any option term periods exercised).  Technical merit is more important than cost. As proposals become more technically equal, as a result of the evaluation process, cost/cost realism becomes more important in the selection of Partners.  The Government plans to issue Partner Contracts to offerors submitting proposals that offer the most benefit to the Government.  Evaluation of proposals shall be accomplished through a detailed review of each proposal, using the following criteria listed in descending order of relative importance: 

A.	POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION AND RELEVANCE TO DLA'S MISSION:
•	Demonstrate an understanding of the DOD Battery Supply Chain and how the proposed solution compares with ongoing efforts.

•	How the proposed work will benefit DLA/DOD and improve life cycle logistics support to the warfighter. 
 
B.	OVERALL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERIT

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking a contractor to provide a resource of preclinical and non-clinical services to advance the development of Topical microbicides (TM) and biomedical prevention (BP).  There is a critical need to promote discovery and transition of new strategies into clinical trials.  This NIAID-sponsored contract focuses on promoting the development of strategies containing TM/BP as a means to address the NIAID and Division of AIDS (DAIDS) priority of controlling and preventing the HIV/AIDS epidemic worldwide.  This contract will provide pre-clinical and non-clinical development services of TM/BP products essential for advancement to clinical testing and for supporting activities required for IND and NDE applications to the FDA.  TM/BP products for development services will be provided by or through the Project Officer and will be identified through NIAID-funded grants and contracts, the private sector, or other sources.  The specific services required will depend on the status of the individual candidate(s), the need to prioritize potential candidates, and an overall product development plan and/or regulatory submission plan to the FDA.  The scope of pre-clinical and non-clinical services to be provided include: (1) Individual gap-filling services on a case-by-case basis, to advance TM/BP products in the development pathway toward clinical assessment; (2) Comprehensive services for selected TM/BP products through a Go/No-Go milestone-driven pathway to accelerate a product toward clinical testing in the most efficient manner; and (3) Support for Best Practices Working Groups (BPWGs) composed of non-contract investigators to assess the critical processes and assays used to compare and advance products to clinical studies.  This activity will ultimately lead to identification and validation of surrogate biomarkers for safety and efficacy testing in clinical trials.  The Government anticipates the potential need to exercise options for additional BPWGs during the life of the contract.  It is estimated that up to four options for a total of 4 BPWGs will be exercised at the discretion of the Government during the period of the contract.  These options may be exercised during contract years 2-7.  The NIAID reserves the right to exercise more than one option per year, however, the total number of options will not exceed four during the 7-year period of the contract.  The NAICS code is 541 & 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.  This RFP will be available electronically on/about September 9, 2008, and may be accessed through the Federal Business Opportunities at https://www.fbo.gov and the NIAID Office of Acquisition (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.

A Technical evaluation will include examination of product literature, and technical features <BR><BR>b. ****All the specifications/salient characteristics must be answered in writing Clin by Clin, as to the compliance or non-compliance with explanations as to non-compliance. <BR>c. The Clin by Clin detailed technical capability requirement is mandatory. The offers must state details clin by clin that the vendor can meet the salient characteristics. <BR>d. ***If the vendors do not detail in their RFQ/offer their verification that they can meet the salient characteristics clin by clin the vendor will not have met the most important evaluation factor of Technical Acceptability/Capability.<BR>2. Price: Price is the second most important factor after technical acceptability/capability<BR>3. Past Performance: Past Performance is the third most important factor. The Government Evaluation Factor in terms of past performance will be ensuring the vendors have no negative information on the Excluded Parties List. https://www.epls.gov/<BR>4. Manufacturers Warranty: Warranty is the fourth most important factor. The Government Evaluation Factor will require the vendor provide a one year limited warranty to repair defects in materials.<BR>***Evaluation Process Summary*******: <BR>1.Technical Acceptibility/Capability will be significantly weighed higher than price. <BR>2. The Government will award the contract to the vendor that RFQ/offers the overall best value to the Government. Best Value is defined as the Governments Evaluation of all factors technical acceptibility/capability, price, past performance and Warranty. <BR>Technical Acceptability/Capability are significantly more important than price. ALTHOUGH PRICE IS NOT FORMALLY SCORED, IT IS IMPORTANT AND CANNOT BE IGNORED. THE DEGREE OF ITS IMPORTANCE WILL INCREASE WITH THE DEGREE OF EQUALITY OF THE PROPOSALS IN RELATION TO EVALUATION FACTORS. All factors must be at least satisfactory to be considered for award.<BR><BR>Offerors should note that in accordance with FAR 52.212-1, entitled Instructions to OfferorsCommercial Items, the Government intends to award a contract on the basis of initial offers received without discussions. Offerors should therefore ensure that their initial proposal contains their best offer from both a price and technical standpoint, and should not assume that discussions will be conducted. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.<BR><BR>If discussions become necessary following the initial evaluation, the competitive range may be limited. <BR><BR>The following are the standard evaluation adjectival ratings used by HCAA Contracting Offices: <BR><BR>EXCELLENT<BR>The RFQ/offer demonstrates a superior understanding of the requirements and a new or proven approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards. The proposal has several exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government. The proposal has no weaknesses. Normal Contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will be sufficient to minimize risk. The proposal is extensive, detailed, and exceeds all requirements and objectives; therefore, has a high probability of meeting the requirements with little or no risk to the Government.<BR><BR>GOOD<BR>The RFQ/offer demonstrates a considerable understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability standards. The proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the Government. Any proposal weakness has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance. Normal Contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties. The proposal generally exceeds requirements in minor areas; therefore, has a strong probability of meeting the requirements with little risk to the Government.<BR><BR>SATISFACTORY<BR>The RFQ/offer demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements and the approach meets all performance or capability standards. The proposal has no strengths that exceed the requirement. The proposal has no material weaknesses. The proposal has some weakness that can potentially cause disruption of schedules, increase in cost, or degradation of performance. Special Contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will minimize any risk. The proposal meets the minimum requirements; therefore, has an acceptable probability of meeting the requirements.<BR><BR>MARGINAL<BR>The RFQ/offer fails to meet performance requirements and capability standards in one or more areas. The proposal has minor omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions without a complete revision of the entire proposal. The proposal has weaknesses that can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special Contractor emphasis, and close Government monitoring. <BR><BR>UNSATISFACTORY<BR>The RFQ/offer fails to demonstrate a basic understanding of the requirements and the approach fails to meet performance or capability standards. The proposal has major omissions and inadequate details to assure the evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of the requirements. The proposal presents an unacceptable risk and cannot meet the requirements without major revisions.<BR><BR>(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of a RFQ/offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the RFQ/offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR><BR>The following are the standard evaluation adjectival ratings used by Health Care Acquisition Activity (HCAA) Contracting Offices for Past Performance:<BR><BR>LOW RISK<BR>Based on offerors past performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<BR><BR>MODERATE RISK<BR>Based on the offerors past performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<BR><BR>HIGH RISK<BR>Based on the offerors past performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<BR><BR>UNKNOWN RISK<BR>No relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction. A search was unable to identify any relevant past performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment. <BR><BR>The following provisions and clauses will be incorporated by reference:<BR>***All Offerors in addition to their emailed quote must include a completed copy of the provisiion at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items with its offer.<BR>FAR 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors Commercial Items<BR>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items<BR>FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions,Commercial Items applies to this acquisition ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 to include the following Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clauses 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and 252.211-7003 Item Identification and Valuation.

<p><br />________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.24 per hour or $129.60 per week or $561.60 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as<br />numbered):</p>
<p>1) Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any<br />employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or<br />professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer<br />System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than<br />$27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour<br />would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage<br />rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those<br />job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate<br />for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates<br />that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour<br />conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an<br />individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope<br />of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which<br />this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for<br />that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures<br />described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or<br />explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance<br />operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All<br />operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web<br />site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation) and computes a proposed rate).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>4.4.13. PARTIAL BASE CLOSURE. Approximately twelve times per year, for four hours in duration, small portions of SAFB will be closed to non-essential personnel due to disaster, emergency, and contingency responses or exercises.

Is this the one that was used on the first RFQ submitted 12 Sep 2008?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  Yes. See Amendment 1 for correction.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  Is there a reason we need to know for breaking out 0001 (4 units) and 0002 (1 unit) -- rather than having all five together as in the original RFQ?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  The reason we changed to two lines items is solely based on different funding citations and constraints in our automated system.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  Regarding paragraph C.1.1.9 -- Since C.1 under SOW provides that the systems 'shall be complete and fully functional within the terms of this contract and operate independently of each other,' is the network requirement necessary?  Or is C.1.1.9 something that could be made optional?<BR><BR>ANSWER:  Paragraph C.1.1.9 has been Reserved.  See Amendment 1.<BR><BR>QUESTION:  Reference Page 4 of the solicitation document, the response date and technical questions due dates are not consistent with those on page 1 of the document.<BR><BR>ANSWER: Dates have been corrected.  See Amendment 1.

ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

Question:  I believe this answer is an error. 
	 
	Question: Will the customer accept a network based system over a CCTV based system?
	
	Answer: No.
	
	 1.5.1 Inside cabinet rack  (1) DVR or Server
	 
	The requirement for DVR or SERVER server would indicate that the system can be network based. 
	 
	 A vendor should be able to propose a solution that runs on its own independent network using standard network cabling and switches. By definition even a standard CCTV system runs on it's own independent coax network.
	 
	I believe the answer refers to the fact that the system can not run on or interfere with any Government or outside network.

<DESC>i.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR><BR>ii.	The solicitation number is F6J0BAFY20081 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  Offerors shall consider any language or terminology contained herein, through inclusion by a clause or provision, or communication, to be that which is related to the type of solicitation indicated in this paragraph (e.g. quote versus offer, proposal, or bid).<BR><BR>iii.	The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26. <BR><BR>iv.	This notice is unrestricted. The associated NAICS code is 451140 and small business size standard is $7,000,000.  The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program does not apply for this acquisition. <BR><BR>v.	Request quote on the following item(s) and quantity(s):  In order to ensure the highest degree of understanding the Government will issue the equipment listing via email by means of spreadsheet, versus inclusion in to this document which is displayed as plain text.  All other solicitation requirements other then the equipment listing shall be contained within this combined synopsis solicitation document.  --- OFFERORS SHALL REQUEST A COPY OF THE EQUIPMENT LISTING VIA EMAIL AT THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS: 136MSG.CONTRACTING@TXCARS.ANG.AF.MIL ---  All quotes shall list the line item number indicated in the equipment listing.  It is prefered, though not required, that offerors submit their line item pricing in a spreadsheet with a format similar to that provided in the equipment listing.<BR><BR>vi.	Applicable  Offerors shall quote Brand Name or Equal.  Items shall meet or exceed the salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics of the brand name requested.  All offerors proposing equal items shall provide sufficent product literature for Government evaluation.<BR><BR>vii.	Applicable - Quotes shall clearly specify a delivery date and type of freight transportation (FOB destination or origin).  It should be noted that the Government prefers FOB destination.  Delivery shall be made to Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base, 76127 for inspection and acceptance by an authorized Government official, unless otherwise indicated by the contracting officer.<BR><BR>viii.	Applicable - The provision at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition; as well as the following addenda: N/A  (validate)<BR><BR>ix.	Applicable - The Government shall utilize the evaluation procedures shown below in lieu of the provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items.  The Government intends on awarding a contract resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  <BR><BR>The following factors shall be used to perform a Best Value evaluation of quotes:  Price and Mission Capability (includes, but is not limited to, quality, delivery, and volume/number of items offered)<BR><BR>The Government does not intend on issuing multiple awards (split awards), as the ability for an offeror to accurately quote and the Government to adequately evaluate some items is largely dependant upon the acceptance of other items (e.g. custom cases in relation to the equipment it houses); thus a single award is contemplated.  <BR><BR>Offerors should note that quotes are not required to be submitted on an all or none basis; therefore partial quotes will be accepted for evaluation.  As such, the Government may award a contract for a portion of the items listed should it represent the overall Best Value to the Government.<BR><BR>In the course of evaluating quotes, the Government may elect to utilize tradeoffs among price and non-price factors.  The purpose of such tradeoffs is to allow the Government to obtain the most advantageous mix of Price and Mission Capability.  If in the event the Government cannot obtain both by means of a single quote, it will determine if it is more advantageous to go with a higher priced quote with a higher degree of capability, or a lower priced quote with a lower degree of capability. <BR><BR>x.	Applicable - Offerors shall include a copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and FAR 52.219-1 (Alt I), Small Business Program Representations, with their quote.  Any quote received by the Government not including these provisions may result in the Government not considering your quote for evaluation.

<DESC>Posted picture of 9-pin connector-24 September 2008N65236-08-R-0210-0002- 23 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions, update drawing for rev2 and provide clarification for other issues.Questions:1)The end "A" connector described on the drawing specification, para. 4.1.1,states a DB-9F, which is a 25-pin connector. The required 9-pin connectorshould be a DE-9S or DE-9P.Response: This was a typo.  Paragraph 4.1.1 should state DE-9F ( where F isfor Female). We need the 9-pin connector.  See http://www.nullmodem.com/DB-9.htm.  The "DB-9F" is not a 25 pin connector.  It is the Government'sunderstanding that the 9 stands for the number of pins.2)The solicitation spec and para. 4.1.1 of the drawing both state jackscrewswithfemale type ends while the drawing shows jack posts.Response: The drawing shows jackscrews with a female type (as stated in thespecs and para. 4.1.1).  Jack posts are not required.3)The specification states that the cable shall flow toward the bottom of theradio, yet the drawing spec shows pin 29 of the 32-pin connector located in away that would cause the cable to flow toward the top of the radio, since pin29is next to the connector key which is toward the top of the radio.Response:  The connector on our drawing should show pins 29 and 32 locatednext to the connector key.4) Please provide a cable assembly in order to create a schematic.Response: The Government does not have a cable assembly available.  This isthe first time these assemblies have been purchased.  We currently haveradios in theater without the appropriate cable.5)Please provide Ohmmeter readings for the pins.Response: Please contact the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) forOhmeter readings of the radio. The radio is a type 1 encrypted device.SPAWAR does not have the authority to release proprietary data about theradios.6) The gauge size of the cable used is 28 gauge.  Can you please advise why20 gauge is being specified?Response: The 20 gauge is correct.  For this cable, the government requires 20gauge cable.7) Do we have a part number for the cable.Response: No.8) What is the purpose of the contract number listed on bottom right of thecable specs documentResponse:  Disregard.  The contract number is not applicable to thisprocurement.The hour and date specified for receipt of offer remains 26 September 2008 at2:00 PM.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to theoffer due date listed herein in writing.  A simple statement acknowledgingreceipt of amendment 0002 is sufficient.N65236-08-R-0210-0001- 22 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to revise the solicitation specifications anddrawing, request a product sample of the cable, and answer questions.1.  The detailed specifications and drawing are revised as attached (DATA-REMOTE CONTROL CAB Rev 1.pdf).  Disregard all other drawings andspecifications.2. Under the "Additional Specifications" listed in the combinedsynopsis/solicitation, the cable length shall be 18 inches (shielded) insteadof12 inches.3. A product sample shall be delivered to Tiffany Boatwright in care of NancyStraight, Code 5.3.1.5.0, SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, 1639 Avenue B North,North Charleston, SC  29405-1639 no later than 26 September 2008.  Thetracking number for this sample shall be sent along with your proposal no laterthan 2:00 PM EST on 26 September 2008. The Government will not pay anyshipping costs related to the submission of the sample.  The product sampleshall be tested by the Government to determine technical acceptability.4. Questions and Answers  Question A. The cable length shall be 12 inches.  What is the (wire)gauge of that?Answer A: The cable should be 18" long, and 20 gaugeQuestion B:  Under 4.1.2, End B connector- Who is the manufacturer?Answer B: End B connector- Harris and AMTI are the only manufacturers knownby the Government. End A, the DB-9, is a common connector made by manymanufacturers.5. The hour and date specified for receipt of offer is hereby extended to 26September 2008 at 2:00 PM.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of thisamendment prior to the offer due date listed herein in writing.  A simplestatement acknowledging receipt of amendment 0001 is sufficient.Drawing and Specifications attached-17 September 2008This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented withadditional information included in this notice.

<DESC><p><strong>Background:</strong> The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California, is seeking to identify sources for Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) services. These services will be performed in various locations, to include Northern &amp; Southern California, Florida, and Colorado. Work under the proposed effort is tentatively scheduled to commence in 2009 and may continue for up to 10 years.
<p><strong>Program Objectives:</strong> SE&amp;I tasks are shared by the Government Program Office, Aerospace Corporation (Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC)), the SE&amp;I Contractor(s), the Atlas and Delta Launch Vehicle Contractors (LVC), and the RSA and SLRS Range contractors. SE&amp;I tasks include providing the coordination, guidance and execution of end-to-end Launch and Range systems engineering and integration activities at the systems level across all internal and external interfaces for system test and verification, system deployment, operations, and sustainment. It also includes oversight and insight of systems engineering and integration as required to ensure system performance is met. It is expected that the SE&amp;I contractor(s) must be capable of working intimately with the Government, external stakeholders' and contractor teams. However, the SE&amp;I contractor must also have the capability to act independently and objectively for the benefit of maintaining LRSW cost, schedule and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Program Responsibilities:</strong> Government Program Office, Aerospace Corporation FFRDC, the SE&amp;I Contractor, and Launch Vehicle Contractors (LVC) shall have the responsibilities described below. The LRSW Government Program Office is the final decision authority for all program matters and exclusively provides direction to contractors. The Government Program Office chairs key program boards and working groups, which bring together the participating contractors and stakeholder agencies for program coordination and execution. The Aerospace Corporation serves as the Trusted Agent of the Government Program Office and provides ongoing oversight of all systems engineering and integration processes and activities.</p>
<p><strong>SE&amp;I Contractor(s):</strong> It is vital that the SE&amp;I Contractor(s) maintain an experienced program management and technical team throughout the life of the program, with the capability to flexibly adapt as the program progresses through each phase of the acquisition process.</p>
<p><strong>SE&amp;I SOCs<br /></strong>Potential sources will provide enough information in their Statement(s) of Capabilities (SOC) to demonstrate they have performed/supported systems engineering and integration contracts on DoD Launch and Range programs of similar complexity, have an understanding of LRSW mission and future technology challenges, and can provide the capabilities in any or all of the task areas listed above. The specific task areas are as defined in the first attachment to this RFI. The second attachment identifies the skill sets needed for proposed sources to be able to perform in each of the task areas.<br /><strong>Responses<br /></strong>Interested SE&amp;I contractor candidates may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC), on any of the task area(s) or on all twelve areas. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractors submitting SOCs addressing more than one task area are requested to submit each task area SOC as a separate chapter or document.</span> A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory for all personnel supporting this effort. Some positions will require Top Secret - Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearance. Interested parties must submit an unclassified SOC along with supporting documents described below. Interested contractors should address potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) in their SOC(s) and, if possible, submit mitigation plans with their SOC(s). No real or perceived Organizational Conflict of Interest can exist (reference FAR 9.505-1). Additionally, if teaming with other contractors provide the name of the contractors. If a teaming agreement is in place please provide a copy of the agreement.<br />The SOC(s) shall not exceed 10 single-sided pages in length for each task area. All responses must conform to 8.5x11-inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point. (The mitigation plan, SOC cover page/ table of contents pages and any teaming agreements are not part of the Capability Statement &amp; will not count against the page limit). This sources sought synopsis is for market research only, seeking qualified prime contractors. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Small Business coordination number is 08-29. Interested parties shall state the size of their business. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request For Proposal. Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the SOC(s).</p>
<p><strong>Submission Instructions:</strong> Submit SOC(s) in either PDF format or Microsoft Word format via 2 CDs and one hard copy to the Government Procurement Contracting Officer, Mr. Robert Nadeau by the Response Due Date: 10 October 2008 by 4:00 PM PDT. <br /><br />LRSW/PK Attn: Robert Nadeau<br />483 N Aviation Blvd Bldg 270 A2-360<br />El Segundo CA 90245</p>
<p>Questions: All communication associated with this RFI shall be submitted in writing to the Government Procurement Contracting Office via email. to: luis.camaraza@losangeles.af.mil .</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="left">Preparedness for public health threats is a major goal of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). An influenza pandemic has a great potential to cause large numbers of deaths and illnesses over a short time period. A pandemic occurs when there is an antigenic shift in influenza A virus and transmission of a new strain to which most or all of the world's population is susceptible. Estimates for the next pandemic, extrapolating from those of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, range from about 100,000 to over 2 million deaths in the U.S. alone.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-ALIGN: left; mso-list: skip" align="left">Influenza antiviral drugs and influenza vaccines are considered a primary means to decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with the next pandemic. HHS is pursuing multiple and parallel strategies to close the gap between current antiviral drug and influenza vaccine supply and the HHS goal of stockpiling licensed and new antiviral drugs and pre-pandemic vaccines as part of the strategic plan for pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p><br />The Department of Health and Human Services through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to support advanced stage development of new antiviral agents for the treatment and prophylaxis of pandemic and seasonal influenza leading toward submission of a U.S. licensure application and development of required industrial capacity to support implementation of the influenza antivirals at full production capacity at or before the onset of a pandemic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>HHS is particularly interested in the advanced development of new influenza antiviral agents designed to affect different targets of influenza virus infection or to enhance effects of present classes of influenza antiviral agents, formulated for long term stability, long bioavailability, and simple dosing regimens. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The contract(s) resulting from this solicitation will be for advanced development, not acquisition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Incremental multi-year funding for cost-reimbursement contracts to biopharmaceutical companies will be provided to support this effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The manufacturing site of antivirals may be in an FDA-approved U.S. facility or foreign manufacturing facility provided that the product can be stockpiled, has a shelf life that is consistent with long term pandemic preparedness, and where production capacity is sufficient for rapid fulfillment of U.S. pandemic stockpile needs at or before the onset of an influenza pandemic. Ultimately, these influenza antiviral agents shall be produced at one or more<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved manufacturing facilities and shall provide sufficient surge capacity to contribute substantially to U.S. and ideally global antiviral needs during an influenza pandemic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of up to 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.&nbsp; A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps on or about October 4, 2008, with proposals being due on or about November 17, 2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.&nbsp; This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this internet site ( <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/">www.fbo.gov</a> ) for the release of this solicitation as well as any amendments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via this website.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26. All responses should be identified with the RFP number, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office Address identified in this notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of April 2008.</p>
