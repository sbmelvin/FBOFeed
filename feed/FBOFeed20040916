<DESC>This BAA addresses a general class of problem that is becoming more acute as the nation deploys sensors and security networks in response to the global war on terrorism.  A number of commercial vendors, responding to the marketplace for security systems, have begun to provide increasing sophisticated interpretation algorithms with their CCTV systems.  Over more than a decade, the Department of Defense has had a major development emphasis on developing the capability for total battlespace awareness.  This BAA intends to leverage those capabilities to adapt the technologies to homeland security concerns and continue to push the state of the art to meet our domestic needs.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) NNG0473250Q for a Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) Chip.  Statement of Work Direct charge collecting anode suitable for use as an asynchronous anode for X-ray polarimetry. An asynchronous anode suitable for X-ray polarimetry consists of a VLSI pixel ASIC circuits implemented in a CMOS process for finely pixelized read-out of a micro-pattern gas detector.  Each pixel is equipped with an individual electronics chain consisting of a charge collecting anode, pre-amplifier, shaping amplifier, and sample and hold circuitry;  the pixels are read out serially.  Each hexagonal pixel is fully covered by a metallic charge collection anode. We intend to purchase services which include the design and fabrication of an asynchronous anode for X-ray Polarimetry and the delivery of 16 or more packaged prototypes. The asynchronous anode for X-ray polarimetry will have the following geometric characteristics: 	Pixels arranged in a hexagonal array with nearest neighbor spacing of 50 micron; 	Active area diameter of 5 mm (i.e.  ~9k independent pixels) The asynchronous anode will have the operational modes equivalent to those in the state of the art X-ray polarimetry asynchronous anode (http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0403019) 	Peak detect, Sample and hold	for serial readout 	Read-out of the analog signal wave-form for selectable pixels 	Asynchronous external trigger 	Charge pulse input for calibration The asynchronous anode has the following design goals: Low noise:				100 electrons per pixel Shaping time:				~3.5 micro-sec Power consumption per pixel:	60 micro-Watt/pixel Readout rate:				10-20 Mhz  Dynamic range:				0.2-20 fC Programatic requirements include Project schedule less than 11 months Project milestones including sufficient milestones that       we (i.e. engineers at GSFC and our collaborators at INFN) can monitor       the characteristics (speed, noise, ...) of the shaping amplifiers, serial       readout control circuitry, the differential output buffers, the common       bias circuitry, and a global simulation of several pixels. Simulation of a single pixel and several adjacent pixels. Award will be based on the best value to the government, with consideration given to the factors of proposed technical merits, of price, schedule, demonstrated understanding of the design goals, and relevant previous experience in the production of direct charge collecting anodes for asynchronous X-ray polarimetry. All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing e-mail to Keith Jahod Jahoda, keith.m.jahoda@nasa.gov, no later than 9/29/2004.  Telephone question will not be accepted. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 3343413 and 500, respectively. The anticipated release date of RFQ NNG0473250 is 09/16/2004 with an anticipated quote due date of 09/30/2004. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the development of a LISA Instrument Data Simulator.  NASA/GSFC intends to purchase this requirement from Montana State University under the authority 10.U.S.C 2304(1)(C), only one responsible source.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. The development of a LISA Instrument Data Simulator (LIDS) requires intricate knowledge of the design and behavior of LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) measurement system and data processing. The Physics Department at Montana State University has been involved with the development of LISA and other related missions for many years.  They possess the requisite technical expertise to perform this task efficiently and accurately. For the past several years Montana State University has been on the leading edge of developing LISA simulation tools and techniques. The Physics Department at Montana State University has already developed a first and second generation LISA simulator that can be modified to meet the requirements of this contract such as interfacing with control, structural, thermal, optical, self-gravity, and orbit models.  The Montana simulator is unique.  The simulator uses an iterative time-of-flight calculation and accepts realistic orbits for the LISA sciencecrafts which are essential requirements for the simulator required under this contract. Montana State University is the only organization with the required skills and tools to build a LISA instrument simulator that meets the requirements of the LISA Integrated Modeling effort.  In addition, NASA will have access to the years worth of historical developmental data from the Montana simulator which represents a significant cost savings to NASA. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 09/29/2004.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

nutrient management and land application practices, runoff and erosion control practices, animal mortality plans, preventive maintenance plan, emergency response plans, and record keeping.  

A&F firms interested in providing these services are to submit three copies of completed form SF-330 to the Contracting Officer at the address shown in this announcement by 3:30 p.m., local time, July 29, 2004, as well as any information that will assist with evaluation on selection criteria.

place over a period of years.  A&E firms must take this into consideration when developing the CNMP.  The A&E firm is expected to make regular site visits.  

This solicitation is being solicited unrestricted.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330, and the small business size standard is $4.0 million.  

Firms will be evaluated and ranked using the following selection criteria listed in descending order of importance:  

(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory  
    performance of required services
(2) Knowledge of local dairy manure management practices
(3) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type 
    of work required, including experience in nutrient 
    management and manure storage, transfer and treatment 
(4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time 
(5) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and 
    private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, 
    and compliance with performance schedules 
(6) Location in the general geographical area of the project and 
    knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that 
    application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number 
    of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the     
    project

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   NAICS Code:  334516.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitaion for a  commercial item prepared IAW the format in FAR Part 12.6.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotations are being requested and a written solication will not be issued.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to this requirement and submit a quotation which will be considered by the Government.  The XT-440S portable x-ray fluorescence analyzer  Innov-X Model 440  Soil Metals Analyzer w/Dual Beam cability will be used by Superfund personnel to conduct screening characterizations for metals contaminated at Superfund sites.   The following requirements must be met for this unit: 1.  This unit must be intended for analysis of metals in soil.  The unit must  be amenable to bulk sampling, with software that corrects for common soil interferences.  A fundamental parameters correction routine is desired in order to avoid the need for site-specific calibration.  At the same time, if the soil is atypical, such as an oil-soaked peat, the correction routine  must be able to compensate for the difference in average atomic number of the sample.  The unit must be able to determine the soil measurements both in situ, or in a cup prepared by drying and homogenizing an intrusive sample. 2.  The energy range of elements detected by the equipment should  extend from chromium (5.4 keV) to cadmium (23 keV) K-lines.  This encompasses mercury and lead, which are analyzed with L-lines.  Chromium is difficult to excite, so an x-ray tube is needed, rather than an radionuclide source.   3.  Ths unit must be as lightweight as possible and easy to use.   This unit will be used for in situ sampling, where the x-rays are directed at the soil directly, in place at the site.  Ergonomically, the pistol-grip handle allows for ease of operation and lack of strain on the wrist of the operator. 4.  The unit must use an x-ray tube rather than a radionuclide  source.  The tube output must be able to  adjust for preferential excitation of a region of the spectrum.  This is needed in analyzing chromium, which radionuclide source excitation is not able to do.  the Innov-X unit is the only unit capable of running chormmium and cadmium samples at the same  time, as the excitation parameters can be adjusted during the run. 5.  A simple method of data transfer in the field from the unit to a laptop computer is needed.  The data shall produce a delimited file easily exportable into common spreadsheet software such as Excel or Lotus-123. The provision  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable and the specific evaluation criteria are as follows:  Technical capability, past performance and price.  Offerors shall include a complete copy  of the provision at FAR 52.212-31, Offerors Respresentations and Certification-Commercial Items, with their offer.  This clause may be found on the internet at the following site:  http://www.arnet.gov/far.  Clause FAR  52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Terms and FAR 52.212-5,  Contract terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition.  Under FAR 52.215-5 paragraph (b) the following additional clauses apply to this acquisition;  FAR 225-1, Buy American Act-Balance of Payments Program-Supplies;  FAR  52.225-13, Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases; and FAR 52-232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other thanb Central Contractor Registration.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to La Asociación Gremial de Exportadores de Productos No Tradicionales (AGEXPRONT) in Guatemala in the development and training of a digital certificates program. 

NOTE: THIS IS A RE-ANNOUNCEMENT. THOSE WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED BIDS FOR THIS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HAVE THE OPTION TO SUBMIT A NEW PROPOSAL OR RE-SUBMIT A PREVIOUS ONE.  

The objective of the Technical Assistance is to assist Guatemala in the development of a digital certificates program as well as a training program support structure for the effective dissemination of key information needed to enhance bilateral trade. The project has three key components:

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00pm Guatemala City, Guatemala time, October 6, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed price contract to FN Herstal, Belgium for the procurement and integration of three hundred, eighty-four (384) GAU-21 (M3M) .50 Caliber Machine Gun/Pintle Head Mount Weapon Systems, one hundred, ninety-two (192) CH-53E R/H integration kits, and one hundred, ninety-two (192) CH-53E L/H integration kits.  This firm fixed price contract will provide for the procurement and installation of these weapon systems on the CH-53E platform in support of the Common Defensive Weapon System (CDWS) Program.  FN Herstal will also provide engineering technical support services, technical publications, training of organizational and intermediate level maintenance personnel, and supply of preventative maintenance kits. This weapon system will provide the Marine Corps with a weapon system common to all assault support helicopters, which will represent a significant increase in interoperability, improved safety features, a higher volume of fire, a minimization of aircraft modifications, no significant weight increases and a reduction in maintenance costs.  The scope of this contract shall include all of the efforts necessary to manufacture and deliver the 384 systems.  This contract will be issued on a sole source basis to FN Herstal, the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the M3M.  FN Herstal is the only known firm whose product successfully meets the stated requirements.  To award the contract to another vendor would result in excessive duplication of effort and costs to the government.  FN Herstal is also sufficiently poised to respond to a rapid deployment capability.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) intends to negotiate a non-competitive contract with Astro Systems, Inc., 7979 Old Georgetown Road, Bethesda, MD 20814 for the installation of PAL, VHF and/or UHF, Television (TV) broadcasting systems in Iraq at frequencies and power levels to be determined by the BBG.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition that is applicable to this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  In order to identify sources that are responsive to meeting the BBG's TV broadcasting systems in Iraq installation requirements, the BBG conducted a market survey, that was initiated via a BBG "Sources Sought" Notice published at the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Business Opportunities (FBO)
for Vendors Internet website on November 14, 2003.  This market survey FBO Notice informed interested sources of the BBG's mandatory technical capabilities and experience requirements that such sources must meet to qualify for performing the BBG's TV broadcasting systems in Iraq installation work, including the urgent and compelling capability of being able to install an interim BBG TV broadcasting system in Baghdad, Iraq by February 29, 2004.  Interested sources responding to the BBG's November 14, 2003 FBO Notice submitted a written "Capabilities Statement" to the BBG to demonstrate that their technical capabilities and pertinent experience may be responsive to the BBG's TV broadcasting systems in Iraq installation requirements, as determined by the BBG's review and validation of the information contained in the submitted Capabilities Statements and any follow-up information requested by the BBG (as also provided for in the November 14, 2003 FBO Notice).  Pursuant to the BBG's review and validation of Astro Systems, Inc.'s capabilities and experience in overseas TV broadcasting systems engineering and installation, as documented in Astro Systems, Inc's. Capabilities Statement that was submitted to the BBG in response to its market survey, the BBG has determined that Astro Systems, Inc. is responsive to the BBG's PAL, VHF and/or UHF, TV broadcasting systems in Iraq installation requirements.  Therefore, the BBG intends to contract with Astro Systems, Inc. to install (including, but not limited to, site surveys, commissioning, testing, and training) new BBG TV broadcast systems in at least two (2) prominent Iraqi cities, Baghdad and Basrah.  It is particularily noteworthy that the urgent establishment of BBG TV broadcasting systems in Iraq is a top U.S. Government priority that specifically includes the BBG's launch and operation of the first TV broadcasting system in Baghdad, Iraq by NLT February 29, 2004 and a second TV broadcast system in Basrah, Iraq by NLT March 22, 2004.  Not achieving this Baghdad TV broadcasting system operating date would result in the BBG's not meeting the U.S. Congress' compelling mandate for the timely establishment of  BBG TV broadcasting systems that will provide television programming to the Iraqi people in key cities, per its authorization and appropriation of FY-2004 funding for this specific purpose.  This Public Notice of the BBG's intent to non-competitively contract with Astro Systems, Inc. is not a solicitation (Request for Proposals).  Other firms that are interested in this BBG TV broadcasting systems in Iraq installation work may respond to this Public Notice by stating their interest, capabilities, and pertinent experience to meet the BBG's TV broadcasting systems requirement cited in the notice, that specifically includes the February 29, 2004 Baghdad TV broadcasting system installation deadline.  The BBG must receive all such "Capabilities Statements" by 2:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time (EST), Wednesday, December 31, 2003.  The BBG's determination not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this Public Notice, is solely within the discretion of the BBG.  Any "Capabilities Statements" and/or other information received by the BBG from interested firms responding to this Public Notice will be considered by the BBG solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.   Any questions regarding this Public Notice shall be submitted via facsimile to Ms. Marlene Brooks, Office of Contracts (M/CON/CR), at (202) 260-0855.  Written responses to this Public Notice shall be facsimiled to Ms. Brooks at (202) 260-0855.  Telephone responses of a firm's statements of interest, capabilities, and pertinent experience will not be accepted by the BBG.  This Public Notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.

<DESC>This serves as a “Notice of Intent” to award a sole source contract to Comcast Cable Communications, Inc, to provide broadband cable connectivity for teleworkers working for the General Services Administration Office of Governmentwide Policy  (OGP) Chief Information Officer (CIO).  The OGP CIO is responsible for managing the Electronic and Information Technology business for OGP.  OGP has a need to provide broadband services and support OGP users.  Broadband services should meet the bandwidth requirement for OGP telework services requirement operating in unison with GSA virtual private network as well as the Agency’s Citrix application server and GSA’s general support systems.  Broadband Services is defined as communications that use several different channels that poses a wider range of frequencies to transmit data streams.  Broadband services can be categorized into several technologies.  The main of these are DSL and cable technologies.  DSL providers utilize Asymmetrical DSL technology, while cable Internet technology utilizes a Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) network.  ADSL technology poses several challenges that make it unable to meet OGP requirements.  Cable internet services provide throughput with critical service performance numbers of 1.5 Mbps down to 768 Kbps up with local DSL services cannot match, 1 Mbps down and 384 Kbps up.  Users’ connectivity and transmission speeds rely on a number of factors that directly influence the technology.  DSL providers utilize bridge taps.  Bridge taps are extensions, between the user and the central office, that extend service to other users.  Distance is also a factor with DSL service and support.  Distance between the teleworker’s house and GSA central office can have a direct effect on DSL performance and reliability.  ADSL technology is unable to perform the conversions needed to transmit between analog and digital signals across fiber-optic cables.  Teleworkers that reside in locations where fiber-optic cables are used will be unable to receive DSL service.  Unlike cable technology, DSL transmissions are also directly affected by the telephone wire gauge.  Teleworkers who have telephone wires of a small gauge will experience transmission and speed difficulties.  Cable Internet technology however is point-to-point where as DSL connections must pass through a substation first causing a decrease in speed times.  GSA OGP examined alternative service providers and determined that Comcast (cable modem with connection speed 3-4 Mbps) is the only DC metropolitan service provider (that services Washington DC, Prince Georges’ County, and Montgomery County) capable of meeting and supporting OGP’s telework requirements both from a technical and business (monthly rate per user) prospective.  This sole source procurement is under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The period of performance is for one base year.  All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 202-329-7250, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  RE:  Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Radome Industry Day
<DESC>Description: This Industry Day is being held to provide and obtain technical information to and from the radome industry and to obtain feedback for Air Force consideration prior to issuing future solicitations. The current inventory of Department of Defense radomes relies on hand lay-up, manufacturing processes and is extremely susceptible to impact damage and weather related deterioration.  The primary reason for field and depot level repairs of Air Force radomes is impact damage and weather related deterioration.  Radomes and their components require extensive preservation/protection to extend service life and prevent operational failures. Current maintenance practices consist of abrasive cleaning, primers, and topcoats for preservation/protection of radome panels and structural members. These coatings are a health hazard and require significant resources for repeated applications and waste stream disposal processes. The Air force must achieve a reduction of these chemicals. Compliance burdens and human health concerns due to exposures are well documented.  Unique and innovative composite materials have recently been developed with the ability to meet or exceed existing Air Force structural integrity requirements for radomes. These technologies offer superior material properties that may significantly reduce environmental burdens associated with corrosion protection and repair, if implemented. Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC/LHH) has established an advanced composite technology insertion program to enhance the operational performance of Air Force radome systems for current and future missions. Successful application of advanced composite materials technology and composite processing modifications must meet the demands of short production cycles, insensitivity to processing conditions, low delivered part cost and specific mechanical and electrical property requirements of radome panels.  

SCOPE:  This Industry Day will cover a variety of current radome systems, including WSR-88D (NEXRAD), AN/FPS-124, and GNDCP CW-1214/F (MILSTAR) in detail and VOR, TACAN, and Vortac in general.  For each of these radome systems, the Air Force is specifically interested in reducing delamination, eliminating painting and minimizing the cost of each radome, while generally being interested in decreasing waste streams, increasing life cycles, and reducing maintenance costs while maintaining all electrical and structural requirements.  The Air Force will be open to suggestions from industry for various design, and manufacturing improvements, but would like to gain information specifically on the uses of thermoplastics in such radome systems.

PURPOSE: The Government shall use this Industry Day to allow prospective industry bidders to receive briefings regarding upcoming procurements, and provide input to the Air Force for consideration prior to issuance of solicitations.  Foreign sources are not permitted to respond due to ITAR/PL 98-94 requirements and/or security requirements.  The Foreign Disclosure Branch has determined that because the effort will contain information on the Military Critical Technology List, foreign participation as a prime contractor is excluded.  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the government in any way.  This is not a formal request for proposal.  Response to this request and attendance is on a voluntary basis and failure to respond will not affect any future acquisitions.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of attendance at Industry Day, nor otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under the contracts provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  

LOGISTICS: The Industry Day will be held at the POE Conference Center, Hill AFB, UT 84056; 8:00 AM on 18 October 2004.  The exact venue will be determined by industry attendance and will be given to interested parties who have contacted the Technical POC below prior to the meeting.  Due to limited space, a maximum of three persons per company will be allowed.  Industry attendees must be US citizens.  In addition to an open venue, each company will be able to meet privately with government representatives for 40 minutes on the 18th or 19th of October 2004.  Visit requests shall be faxed to the Technical POC listed below to enable entry to the installation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/test program services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and FAR Subpart 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitatation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Please see the below for a description of services:  

Dover Air Force Base Fire Department is looking for a consolidated multiple-position Enhanced 911 and conventional/trunked radio control solution like/similar to Positron Power Radio and 911 System for their new Emergency Operations Center.  The solution should provide us with state of the art technology for emergency services dispatching. We would like the capability to control the radio and phone through a single headset.  We want to operate the phone and radio system via touch screen while keeping a desktop phone fully functional as a backup.  We should be able to talk on the radio and phone at the same time without mixing audio.  The Enhanced 911 system should provide ANI/ALI immediately and automatically without pushing extra buttons.  The 911 systems must provide a NENA format CAD spill to our Monaco D21 Fire Alarm System.  The radio should at least provide control of multiple resources by different agencies, control stall doors, bunkroom lights and alarm screen.  We would like phone and radio to be one system to eliminate possible incompatibility issues and to streamline maintenance needs.  

Solution must integrate seamlessly with existing equipment used by the base.  The radio system is a Motorola smart zone trunked repeating radio system.  The Base currently uses a Nortel Meridian 1 PBX.  All voice communication is to be recorded by a Mercom Max-pro voice recorder.    

The required quantities are 5 positions with 3 primaries in one building and the other 2 as alternates in another building located on Dover AFB, DE.  

We currently do not have funding for this project, but if funding becomes available, it will be awarded by 1 Oct 04.  

Please provide installation, warranty and any maintenance offered with your bid.

THE FOLLOWING ARE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS PERTAINING TO FA8601-04-T-0161: 1.  Q.  Does 4-color packaging refer to the printing on the DVD itself or to a  4-color insert to go inside the DVD case?   If it refers to the insert, is the  contractor responsible for writing and designing the 4-color insert? A.  If the insert means a booklet inside the DVD package, the contractor does  not need to develop.   If the insert means the cardboard label inside the clear plastic cover on the  DVD package exterior, then yes, the contractor will need to develop.  NASIC has  artwork for the package exterior, however contractor will need to modify,  include text and reproduce.   2.  Q.  Do you have an idea of the length you+re expecting for the DVD review  disk? A.  Video is expected to be 10 minutes, reviews will probably be up to the  same.    3.  Q.  Some of the historic scenes may be more available as stills.  Would you  object to a mixture of stills and live action video to cover the historic  material? A.  No, historic scenes should be moving/live video.  4. Q. Is the writer familiar with the location of the stock footage written  into the script? A.  There are dozens of stock footage houses and NASIC will not dictate where  the contractor should access/pull stock footage.  However, it would be helpful  for NASIC to review the research footage contractor receives from stock house (s) prior to purchasing to ensure adequate/suitable footage.   5.  Q.  The reference to the music on storyboard frame 3 is unclear because any  form of a pop song will not be license free--"Does Anybody Really Know What  Time It Is?" - Chicago.  Time seems to be the story theme of the video and the  phrase "Do you know what time it is?...Do you care?" is used with the 9-11  shots.  So I guess the question here is, do you want contractor to find license- free music or do you want them to use pop music that people would be familiar  with and pay for it? A.  The reference to Chicago is not set in stone.  We+d prefer to use license- free music, so contractor may adjust music selection accordingly.   6.  Q.  Pages 22, 23 + 24 of the “7 Seconds” storyboard refer to “stock  footage” inside a jet cockpit, including a warning light going off and the  pilot taking counter measures. Again, something so specific may not be  available as stock footage. Does this mean that:  this footage can be “generic” and enhanced with computer graphics and sound  effects to achieve the desired effect this footage exists somewhere else other  than a stock footage house and we can have access to it or that it is  potentially new footage that needs to be shot in a jet simulator cockpit? A.  NASIC has existing "generic" footage for this portion of the storyboard,  however will require customization/manipulation to simulate alarms and voice  communications to/from control tower.    7. Q. In 3.0 Deliverables you request B-roll footage on DigiBeta and Dvcam and  stock footage and production elements on Dvcam. Since all footage in this  project is either stock footage, footage provided by NASIC, or footage we shoot  of the students, what is being referred to in the deliverable as “B-roll  footage”? A.  B-roll footage includes un-used full or partial sections of stock footage  and student section not in the final product.    8.  Q.  Are “extras” required for the classroom scene behind the primary actors? A.  Extras not required, but would be up to the contractor. 9. Q.  In the Q+A it states that “NASIC will produce and edit the  interview/commentaries of the script writers, committee members, and NASIC  employees and provide this to the contractor for inclusion in the DVD.” Please  clarify if the contractor is responsible in any way for either shooting or  editing the interview/commentaries or the behind the scenes sequence for the  DVD. If we are responsible for any of this content, is there a desired length  of the final pieces? A.  Contractor is responsible for shooting and editing the  interviews/commentaries with actors in the student portion of the video.   Desired length is approximately 2-3 minutes per actor for  interviews/commentaries.  NASIC will produce and edit the  interviews/commentaries with script writers, committee members, and NASIC  employees.    *************************************************************************** FA8601-04-T-0161 UPDATE, 8 SEP 04, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS The following questions and answers are in regard to FA8601-04-T-0161 1.  Q.  In SOW Section 2.0 Production Delivery Details, do all these things  need to be provided with the proposal or will this follow after award of  contract?  (For example, the shooting locations, seven suitable actors, three  voice talents). A.  None of the things listed in Section 2.0 of the SOW should be submitted  with the proposal.   2.  Q.  What are the travel possibilities? A.  Travel should be quite limited and may not be necessary at all.   3.  Regarding audio sound bites: Q.  Are they meant to be audio versions of “stock footage,” where contractor  needs to find specific voice actualities from historic speeches?  If so, does  Gov’t have approximate dates when these comments were made?  Were they  recorded, or did they only appear in print?  The following quotes (Page 11 and  14) were not attributed to anyone in the script we reviewed:  “Every American  is an enemy to us” (Osama Bin Laden?); “War with the United States is  inevitable.  We cannot avoid it.”  Is that said by a foreign leader?  If so,  who, and as with the other quotes, do we need to find a voice actuality of it?   If not, are these clips to be read by a narrator, or perhaps by an actor or  narrator with a foreign accent (or several different actors)? A.  The last option is probably the best.  Finding actual sound bites might be  very tough and is not required by the Statement of Work.  However, the Gov’t  does not want to dictate how the contractor to handle this issue.     4.  Q.  Willl the source of these quotations be identified in some way, such as  text on the screen? A.  They could be added in text but this isn’t required by the Statement of  Work.  This is up to the contractor.   5.  Q.  One sound bite appears to be an oath of office by a president.  Do you  want an actual news sound bite?  If so, which president? A.  This sound bite is the same as anyone who gives the oath to protect the  country, i.e., military oath. 6.  Q.  What is the anticipated shelf life of this project? A.  Approximately 2 to 3 years max. 7.  Q.  What is the intended distribution or audience for this project?  Who is  the intended audience? A.  18 to 24 year olds and slightly above…students, recent grads, ROTC, USAF  Academy Cadets, general public 8.  Q.  Can we use appropriate mixes of production library music, or do we need  to commission an original music score? A.  Production music is fine; however, the Gov’t does not want to dictate how  the contractor handles this issue. 9.  Q.  How long are the “Special Features” segments for which the contractor  is responsible?  (A.  Interviews/commentaries by actors, and B.  Behind-the- scenes location shoot and editing) A.  The contractor would shoot the actors while on the set.  NASIC will edit  the videos here and provide several pieces for inclusion on the DVD.   10.  Q.  For behind the scenes shots of the production portions, can we use a  handheld mini-DV camera?  Should we use Digital Betacam for the more formal  interviews, or do you prefer the more informal, behind-the scenes approach that  the mini DV brings? A.  DV would be fine; however, that is up to the contractor to decide. 11.  Q.  The jet pilot attack scene (pages 22-24) is to be a stock shot of a  fighter jet cockpit, with actors voicing the dialogue between the pilot and the  ACC.  In other words, no effort will be made to shoot a specific video scene  for this? A.  Correct, stock footage will be used.   12.  Q.  The NASIC-in-action shots on page 18 are to be stock footage.  Does  the military have relevant footage for this type on file that the contractor  could access? A.  NASIC will provide the in-house footage for page 18. 13.  Q.  What is the specific purpose of this production? A.  To show college students, cadets and the general public the nature of  threats to our country and the critical role that NASIC plays in identifying,  understanding and deterring those threats. *************************************************************************** FA8601-04-T-0161 UPDATE,  2 SEP 04, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS The following questions and answers are in regard to FA8601-04-T-0161.   1.  Q.  In paragraph 2.5 of the Statement of Work (SOW), concerning stock video  footage, are there some pages missing from the list?  Is contractor to provide  stock video footage? A.  Clarification of paragraph 2.5:  The pages listed in paragraph 2.5 of the  SOW (pages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, and 24) are those  for which the contractor must acquire stock video footage.

Are SECRET security clearances required? A.  No, it it unlikely that contractors would need access to the National Air  and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) during the production of this video.  A  SECRET clearance is not required to submit a quote or to be awarded a contract  for this project.  Paragraph 5.3 of the SOW will be revised to reflect this  change and a revision will be posted to this web site.   3.  Q.  Is all taping to take place at Wright-Patterson AFB? A.  Not necessarily.  Per SOW paragraph 2.1, the contractor is to recommend at  least three locations. 4.  Q.  How should price quotation be broken down – itemized or a lump sum? A.  Price quotation should be a lump sum that covers all services/materials  associated with this project. 5.  Q.  In paragraph 2.10 of the SOW, it describes a DVD review disk.  Is  contractor to produce this also? A.  Yes, contractor is to produce the DVD review disk.

Para 2.8 of the SOW concerning animation, are NASIC shield and USAF  logo to be animated in 2D or 3D? A.  Animation should be 3D. 7.  Q.  Para 2.10 of the SOW, the requirement for an active web link requires a  DVD-ROM master which limits your playback universe.  Does NASIC want a DVD or  DVD-ROM? A.  NASIC wants a DVD.  8.  Q.  Para 2.11, Replication and Packaging:  What are the packaging  requirements? A.  Packaging should be mailable by the USPS, but attractive and easy to take  hundreds to various locations (schools, trade shows, etc.).  Also, in para 3.0  of the SOW, it states that DVD replication disks should be in 4 color packaging. 9.  Q.  With the delivery date 12 weeks after the award of the contract, do you  have a projection as to when you will be awarding the contract? A.  It is our intent to award a contract mid-late Sep 04.   10.  Q.  Para 1.1.6 of the SOW, meetings are to be held between NASIC rep and  the PM.

52.212-2 ADDENDUM TO EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
(a)   Basis for Award. (1) The Government will award one contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror 
whose proposal provides the best value to the Government with appropriate consideration given to the major Areas, listed in descending order of importance:  Technical/Management, Past Performance, and Price.  The Technical/Management is significantly more important than Past Performance.  Past Performance is significantly more important than Price.  The Technical/ Management and Past Performance Areas when combined are significantly more important than Price.  Offerors are cautioned that a significant deficiency in any area, factor, sub-factor or element may be grounds for exclusion of the offeror’s proposal from further evaluation and consideration for award.  Mere parroting of the requirements without detailed explanation of how the requirements will be achieved is not acceptable.  The Areas and Factors are identified as follows:

(A)	AREA I – TECHNICAL/MANAGMENT:   Factor 1 is more important than Factor 2.  

FACTOR 1 –  Technical Approach
FACTOR 2 –  Management Approach  
		
(B)	 AREA II - PAST  PERFORMANCE. 

(C)	 AREA III – PRICE 
	 
(2)	EVALUATION APPROACH.  Each proposal will be evaluated on merit, best overall value to the 
government, price and other factors considered.  In addition to other factors, offers will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the government that might result from making only one award, particularly the risk to the Government from a technical integration, logistics and administrative cost perspective.
 

(A)	AREA I – TECHNICAL/MANAGEMENT.  The Government will evaluate the extent to 
which the offeror’s technical/management proposal demonstrates a sound, practical methodology for satisfying the requirements stated in the solicitation.  Proposals that fail to meet the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements may be grounds for rejection of the entire proposal.  
	
(1)  FACTOR 1 -  TECHNICAL APPROACH - The Government will evaluate the extent to which the proposal demonstrates the ability of the offeror to meet the technical requirements established in the Performance Work Statement to include types of training and technical surveillance curriculum development.  In accordance with the requirements outlined in the PWS, both objective and subjective data will be collected in order to assess the technical surveillance training proposal for suitability and effectiveness.   

(a)	SUBFACTOR 1:  Types of Training (PWS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 
and 1.7):    Demonstrate training experience and knowledge in types of 
training. 


(b)	SUBFACTOR 2:  Technical Surveillance Curriculum Development (PWS 2.0, 2.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, and 2.1.4).  All elements are of equal importance.

Element 1:  Demonstrate technical capability and expertise in developing curriculum for types of training outlined in Subfactor 1, Types of Training. 

Element 2:  Demonstrate technical capability and expertise in developing curriculum for hands-on training for technical surveillance tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP).

Element 3:  Demonstrate understanding of curriculum requirements as stated in PWS 2.1.3 and 2.1.4.

(c)	SUBFACTOR 3:  Sample Program of Instruction (POI) -  The offeror shall 
submit a draft outline of a POI for the initial four (4) week training course.  The draft outline of the proposed POI for the initial course will be evaluated to see how well it demonstrates a full and complete understanding of the training requirements IAW the PWS.

		(2)  FACTOR 2 – MANAGEMENT APPROACH

(a)	Management.  The offeror’s ability to provide management support 
necessary for the successful accomplishment of technical surveillance training courses will be evaluated.  All elements are of equal importance.

Element 1: The adequacy of the offeror’s overall management organization, its methods of operation, and its techniques and system of controls to include methods for coordinating and organizing an efficient training course on short notice (less than four (4) weeks) will be assessed.

Element 2:  The offeror’s facility management practices for providing a safe and comfortable training environment IAW the PWS (3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7)

Element 3: The Government will evaluate offeror’s proposed  methodology and processes for obtaining qualified instructors that have experience and/or education in areas of training specified in the PWS (8.0, 8.1, 8.1.1, 8.1.2, 8.1.3, 8.1.3.1, 8.1.3.2, 8.1.3.3, 8.1.3.4, 8.1.3.5, and 8.2).  

Element 4:  The resumes of proposed instructors will be evaluated to determine the extent of training in subject areas, operational experience in the skill sets to be trained, relevant education and appropriate skill levels to develop and maintain the training material and teach the courses.  

Rating Methodology – The following color/adjectival ratings will be used for the rating assigned in the technical/management areas as appropriate.    
Color	Rating	Definition
Blue	Exceptional	Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the Special Operations Command.
Green	Acceptable	Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.
Yellow	Marginal	Does not clearly meet some specified minimum performance or capability requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance, but any proposal inadequacies are correctable.
Red	Unacceptable	Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable














(B)  AREA II:  PAST PERFORMANCE.

1)	Performance risk considers those risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation requirements as indicated by the offeror's record of past/current performance on relevant contracts.  The Performance Risk Assessment Group (PRAG) evaluation will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor’s performance of an offeror and all subcontractors/team members.  Proposals shall be evaluated to determine if the contracts and sources submitted for the prime and subcontractors/team members are current and relevant.   If no relevant historical or current data exists then the procedures of FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv) will apply.  The Government will evaluate the Proposal and data from outside sources considering the following aspects:  Cost/Schedule Planning & Control, Quality Assurance, and Cooperation.  This includes the offeror's performance in cost, schedule, and the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's history for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's businesslike concern for the interests of its customers.

2)	If the offeror has no relevant prior experience, a failure to state “No Experience” may cause the proposal to be excluded from further consideration for award.

3)   Rating Methodology for Past/Present Performance: A significant achievement, 
problem, or lack of relevant data in any element of work can become an important consideration in the source selection process.  A negative finding under any factor may result in an overall high-risk rating.  Therefore, offerors are reminded to include relevant past efforts, as described above, including demonstrated corrective actions, in their proposal.  Each contract submitted by the offeror to substantiate past/present performance will first be rated for relevancy by the Government and a rating of Highly Relevant, Relevant, Somewhat Relevant or Not Relevant will be assigned.  This relevancy rating will be used when considering how much weight to ascribe to each contract.  Then Contract Performance Ratings will be ascribed to the Offeror's work on that contract as follows: Unsatisfactory, Marginal, Satisfactory, Very Good, or Exceptional.  After the Government considers all factors, a Final Performance Risk Assessment will be made for each offeror.  That assessment will be one of the following:

   PERFORMANCE RISK ASSESSMENT DEFINITIONS

High Risk: Based on the Offeror's performance record, it is unlikely that the offeror willsuccessfully perform the required effort in accordance with the terms and conditions the contract.
Moderate Risk: Based on the Offeror's performance record some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Low Risk: Based on the Offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.
Neutral Risk: The offeror has no recent, relevant performance information. (To receive a Neutral Risk Rating, the offeror must include the following statement: "The offeror has no relevant past/present performance." Otherwise, one of the other ratings will be applied, with the Government determining relevancy.  Failure to provide the required information may be treated as a deficiency in the Offeror's proposal.)

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR STRUCTURES TEST LABORATORY ACQUISITIONS SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to the following questions regarding Solicitation NNJ04077249Q.  1) Under the hardware description in the system overview you are asking for UP TO 256 channels. There are several issues, which seem confusing to me. The term UP TO leaves a lot to interpretation. Do you expect a 256 channel proposal or will something less be considered? This makes a big difference in the pricing of the proposal.  Response NASA: The overview section was intended to provide general information about the requirements. Some vendors may have 1 channel, 4 channel, 8 channel, 16 channel boards which could affect the way they populate their system’s channel count. The specific channel requirements are detailed in Sections III and IV of the RFQ. A channel count up to 256 is acceptable.  2) You asked for sampling at a maximum of 1,000 samples per second and future expansion capability to 512 channels without affecting performance. Yet, down in the data transfer section you say that 400,000 measurements per second is acceptable. These two numbers don't match. To meet the hardware requirement in the overview you must have a minimum of 512,000 measurements per second as your data transfer rate. Which one is acceptable? Response NASA: All channels do not have to sample at 1000 samples per second at the same time. A combination channel count for a transfer rate of 400,000 is acceptable. 3) Each chassis shall support a minimum of 64 channels. Do you want? 256 channels or is 64 channels acceptable? If a chassis only houses 64 Channels do you expect the proposal to contain four chassis to achieve your "up to 256 channels" request? Response NASA: One 256-channel chassis or 2 ea. 128 channel or 4 ea. 64 channel chassis is acceptable as long as they meet the space requirement of  (I g).	  4) You expect to have one to four chassis, depending on the potential channel counts in each chassis, to provide a total of 256 independent digitizers, connections for 256 sensors, as well as a display for control and viewing. All of this is supposed to fit in an area 14 X 19 X 23? Response NASA: The control and display should be performed on the “server workstation” connected thru an Ethernet link to the input chassis.  5) How firm is the requirement for a 64 channel chassis? Response NASA:  The chassis may be of a higher channel count as long as it meets the space requirements of  (I g). 6) How firm is the requirement for a maximum rack space for 256 channels of 14X19x23?  Response NASA: This requirement is firm. 7) How firm is the requirement for an Ethernet interface? Response NASA: This requirement is firm. 8) There are a number of items in the Specs that all limit one another in the possible implementation of your system, namely The DAQ system should be an off the shelf package (System Overview) Response NASA: The system should already be designed, verified and operational in the field by multiple users that could provide NASA with feedback.	  9) The System shall have an A/D converter for each channel with no multiplexing or sample and hold. (System Overview) Response  NASA: Individual channel multiplexing is preferred because of full integration of the signal over the sample period.	   10) There should be no limitation to the position of the channel type in the chassis. (I.f) Response  NASA: The hardware and software should work together to identify the type of input module being used in any slot without having to dedicate a specific module to a specific input slot.   11) Maximum allowable rack space for 256 channels is 14x19x23 inches (I.g) Response  NASA: This is a firm requirement.  12) Common Mode Voltage +- 50 V typical (III-last bullet) Response NASA: There are many differential amps on the market that range from 6 to 250 volts common mode. NASA is flexible over this range.	    The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on August 27,2004.

A statement stating that we are interested in submitting a full proposal at a later date?
A 43.  A proposal is required by September 21, 2004 as stated in amendment 0001.
