<DESC>It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to procure professional services on a sole source basis from Ms. Carrie Le, 345 Franklin Street, #107, Cambridge, MA 02139.  The purpose of this procurement is to acquire
professional project support services for a period of six months, with one six-months option, to assist CIT’s program staff in administering its Information Technology (IT) management activities.  CIT is seeking the specialized services of an individual with an expert knowledge and understanding of CIT’s unique and complex IT issues who can successfully accomplish the following tasks:  (1) Provide management support to the Office of the Deputy Chief Information Officer (ODCIO) on complex IT issues; (2) Provide management support for special initiatives or projects relating to NIH IT Consolidation, Competitive Sourcing, and Administrative Restructuring; (3) Assist in the formulation of IT strategy for the NIH and the development of IT strategic plans; (4) Conduct analyses and recommend adoption of new or enhanced approaches to the implementation, management, delivery, and support of IT systems and networks; and gather information and prepare reports that focus on CIT and ODCIO operational issues; (5) Conduct studies and analyses in evaluating potential implementation of emerging IT technologies for NIH and HHS; (6) Gather data and develop documents analyzing major issues addressing technical IT and IT management concerns; and (7) Conduct studies and analyses of issues associated with developing and implementing enterprise systems, scientific computing, IT security, portals, etc. for the NIH.  CIT has determined that based upon her previous experience and expertise, Ms. Le will not require orientation to CIT’s management of IT issues and is the only source with the unique qualifications who can successfully accomplish the specified tasks.

She served as a Special Assistant to the NIH Chief Information Officer (CIO) on a wide range of complex IT issues.

Prior to her work with CIT Ms. Le was involved in both the public and private sector as a senior consultant where she served as a Research Team Lead on an organizational assessment and industry comparison review; as a Business Architecture Team Member responsible for negotiating a satisfactory solution to complex issues for implementation of a web portal with online transactions; and as the Customer Relationship Management Architect and subject matter expert for the design and development of an internal order-to-bill web-based prototype solution for European wireless carriers seeking to support third generation mobile services.  Additionally, Ms. Le worked as a Requirements Team Member for a requirements assessment and system review and as a Team Lead for the implementation of a custom order entry and provisioning system that successfully supported entry into the local service market for a national long distance carrier.  Ms. Le’s background includes working as a Systems Analyst with the State Health Department for Indiana on the implementation of a data warehouse for senior management and also as a Systems Analyst with a public sector utility in software vendor selection for enterprise-wide installation of HR, Financial, and Work Management software.

<DESC>The purpose of the RFQ is to receive proposals from providers located in the Eugene, Oregon area to provide laboratory services at their site for VA patients.  The Eugene VA outpatient clinic has limited laboratory equipment and certain tests are contracted out into the community.  It includes both contractor site and at-residence blood draws.  This is a replacement contract for an on-going requirement.  This service is not for all tests, nor is it for reference lab testing.  Most lab services are either performed at the clinic or sent to the VA Roseburg Healthcare System for processing.  The provider only serves as supplemental support for VA resources.

<CONTACT>Rebecca Vaughn, 256-895-1395
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, Alabama in support of the U.S. Military Academy (USMA), NY, intends to privatize its electric distribution system.  This privatization does not include the electric commodity and does not supplant e xisting commodity contracts.  Privatization is the transfer of ownership, which includes operation & maintenance, repair, improvements, etc. of Army owned systems to a non-Federal entity, and the subsequent acquisition of the utility distribution services from the new owners of the systems.  The Government will retain liability of any pre-existing environmental conditional conditions.  The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under10 U.S.C. 2688.  The conveyance will tr ansfer all rights, title, and interest of the United States Government in and to the utility distribution system.  The conveyance will not include any real property.  The contract for the acquisition of utility distribution services will be for a term of 5 0 years.    USMA’s electric distribution system is a modern, well-maintained system. Due to the large number of cadets and support staff, upgrades are frequently completed to maintain and meet state of the art education.  The local utility company enters the property at 2 locations with 35,000 volts and is then transformed to 13,800 volts and 4,160 volts. The transformation is accomplished by one (1) regulator station, four (4) primary substations, more than three dozen secondary substations and numerous transformers t hat deliver the power to the final user.  There are over 547,339 linear feet of underground primary cable and 150,660 linear feet of underground secondary cable.  These cables reach their destination through 439 manholes and 410,475 linear feet of mostly c oncrete encased duct.  There are 148,818 linear feet of overhead primary cable and 37,986 linear feet of overhead secondary cable.  The overhead has more than 303 utility poles with associated hardware.  There are over 1,099 street light standards and pole s that are a combination of a series of street lighting and multiple volt lighting with over 581,700 linear feet of underground overhead cable.  Many of the street light poles are specially cast structures.  Transformers number more than 200 and all oil fi lled transformers are tested every three years for PCB’s and other contaminants.  Preventive maintenance is performed regularly on all primary and secondary switching and all 100+ substation relays are tested yearly.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  The RFP will be available during the March 2002 timeframe electronically through the Internet at www.hnd.usace.army.mil/contract.

<DESC>The DOE/NETL is seeking applications to conduct long-term (minimum of two-to-four months at optimum process conditions) field testing of advanced mercury control technologies to (1) verify technology performance in terms of total (50-80%+ based on coal type, equipment, etc.) and speciated mercury removal relative to changes in load and coal-mercury concentration for all coal types (including blends) but emphasizing high-elemental, low rank coals, (2) determine realistic process/equipment costs for various levels of mercury removed for a variety of equipment configurations focusing on smaller surface collection area (SCA) electrostatic precipitators (SCA<300 ft2/thousand actual cubic feet of flue-gas) for bituminous coals , (3) determine mercury removal levels for  blends of different rank coals including subbituminous/high-sulfur bituminous; (4) quantify balance-of-plant (BOP) impacts such as Electro-Static Precipitator (ESP) performance, baghouse performance and bag life, byproduct contamination, corrosion, parasitic load, etc.; and (5) measure and assess potential multiple pollutant or co-control associated with mercury control technology. In addition, several semi-continuous emission monitors (S-CEMS) would be used to monitor variations in mercury content of flue gas and track technology performance while collecting high quality inlet/outlet mercury speciation data with Ontario Hydro measurements at the beginning, middle and end of each test campaign (plus additional measurements as needed to verify S-CEM results). Tests of by-products may be limited to characterization tests (foaming index, etc.) but collection of enough samples would be obtained for other programs to conduct more detailed or extensive tests, and measurement of mercury in all streams (including water) to seek closure on mercury balances. NETL held two workshops (in June and September 2002) with key stakeholders from the utility industry, government agencies, research organizations, and academia to obtain input on the content and structure of future mercury research and development. A summary of the workshop proceedings can be found at www.netl.doe.gov/coalpower/environment.  The workshop participants identified a number of different configurations and technologies that need further long-term testing. In response, DOE-NETL is issuing a solicitation focused on four major areas that are expected to be important in developing mercury control strategies for the coal-fired electric utility industry and help ensure the continued availability of low-cost electricity from coal while meeting growing air quality demands. Details concerning the solicitation are described below (with allowable scale of testing described in the attached Table 1 document. 1). Topic Area 1 would focus on sorbent injection technology, Topic Area 2 would cover technologies aimed at wet flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) enhancement, Topic Area 3 would seek proposals offering oxidation systems and Topic Area 4 would allow for any technologies ready for long-term field-testing. The solicitation supports the overall goal of the Department of Energy/Office of Fossil Energy's Innovations for Existing Plants (IEP) Program to develop advanced technology and knowledge products that enhance the environmental performance of the existing fleet of coal-fired power plants. The four Areas of Interest for this solicitation are: TOPIC 1: FIELD TESTING OF ACTIVATED CARBON/SORBENTS UPSTREAM/DOWNSTREAM OF EXISTING UTILITY PARTICULATE CONTROL DEVICES FOR BITUMINOUS AND LOW RANK COALS (POWDER RIVER BASIN AND LIGNITE) TOPIC 2: FIELD TESTING OF EFFECTIVE MERCURY CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES UPSTREAM OF AND ACROSS WET FLUE GAS DESULFURIZATION SYSTEMS TOPIC 3: FIELD TESTING OF NON-SORBENT BASED CONCEPTS FOR INCREASING THE OXIDATION OF ELEMENTAL MERCURY FOR REMOVAL IN DOWNSTREAM AIR POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT TOPIC 4: OTHER MERCURY CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES READY FOR LONG-TERM FIELD-TESTING Table 1. Topic Area Matrix (See attachment) Scale of Testing DOE anticipates allocating $1.5 million or less in cost sharing per test site. DOE recognizes that certain mercury control technologies proposed for full-scale testing may require significant outlays for capital equipment in order to be tested. Given that the funding available for this solicitation is limited and is to be used primarily for testing and evaluation of the performance of the proposed technology and not for the purchase of equipment, DOE is allowing for slip-stream testing of technologies under Topic Areas 3 and 4. However, if the offeror wants to test at full scale, then they would be required to cover the additional costs above DOE threshold of $1.5 million per test site (or 75% cost sharing, whichever is less). DOE anticipates that funds will be approximately allocated as 2/3 to full-scale testing and 1/3 to pilot-scale testing. It is anticipated that there will be 9-12 Financial Assistance (Cooperative Agreements) awards with performance periods ranging from 12- 42 months. The total estimated Award Value for all projects awarded under this solicitation is estimated at $19-$25 million with total federal funding anticipated between $15-$20 million with a required recipient cost sharing of 25% of total cost. Eligibility for participation in this Program Solicitation is considered to be full and open.  All interested parties may apply.  The solicitation will contain a complete description of the evaluation factors and the relative importance of each factor.   Applications submitted by or on behalf of 1) another Federal agency; 2) a Federally Funded Research and Development Center sponsored by another Federal agency; or 3) a Department of Energy (DOE) Management Operating (M&O) contractor will not be eligible for award under this solicitation.  However, an application that includes performance of a portion of the work by a DOE M&O contractor will be evaluated and may be considered for award subject to the provisions to be set forth in Program Solicitation DE-PS26-03NT41718. Once released, the solicitation will be available for downloading from the IIPS Internet page.  At this Internet site you will also be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to submit an application.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard Research & Development Center intends to negotiate and award a sole-source contract to Systems Planning & Analysis, Inc. to develop and demonstrate use of a Wide Area Surveillance (WAS)/Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) General Campaign Analysis Model (GCAM) application that encompasses the elements required to analyze Coast Guard missions; present homeland security MDA capabilities; potential future surveillance capabilities; and notional MDA Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) Architecture. The Coast Guard (CG) is the lead federal agency for maritime domain awareness (MDA) working with other branches of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (including Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Transportation Security Administration), federal and local law enforcement (including the Drug Enforcement Agency), local port authorities and the Department of Defense.  To carry out their missions, the Coast Guard and other agencies require some level of MDA in the approaches and waters surrounding the United States.  Enhanced MDA, i.e. a more accurate description of vessel movements, identities and characteristics, has a positive impact on homeland security (and conventional) missions.  What is not well quantified, however, is how much is enough.  DHS Science and Technology (S&T) Division and the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) require a means to analyze the tradeoff between alternative technologies and level of MDA capability versus enhanced operational effectiveness (including cost).   The Coast Guard Research and Development Center (RDC) has already adapted the General Campaign Analysis Model (GCAM), originally developed for the Analysis Division of the Chief of Naval Operations, for use in Coast Guard mission scenarios.  GCAM is a proven collection of innovative object-oriented/agent-based analysis tools that allow operations research analysts to create new, custom methods to fit a large class of modeling & simulation (M&S) - based analytic problems.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541330.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement to the above address. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement(s). To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil.  For information concerning the acquisition, contact the contracting official listed above. See notes 1, 22 and 26.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Donald MacGee, Contract Specialist, 617-494-2803
<DESC>NA The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 41U.S.C. 253(c)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements with, a small business, Coherent Technologies, Inc. (CTI), located in Louisville, Colorado.  The Volpe Center in support of the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is acquiring two, CTI brand name WindTracer® doppler pulsed light detection and ranging (LIDAR) base systems, the wake vortex processing software and associated logistical support.  Only CTI manufacturers an off-the-shelf LIDAR system configured for use through ap plication of a CTI algorithm for processing backscattered laser energy signals for wake turbulence detection and characterization.  In addition, CTI's system development staff possesses extensive knowledge in the area of wake turbulence detection and airport operations in general. CTI's WindTracer® system including the wake vortex processing software has the ability to detect, track and characterize aircraft vortices in airport environments and includes the following minimum set of requirements: (1) High laser pulse repetition rate; (2) High spatial and temporal resolution for wake scans; (3) Proven wake processing algorithm; (4) Near real-time wake tracking; (5) Eye-safety; (6) Ability to perform and process multiple azimuthal vortex scanning planes; (7) Un-attended operation and environm entally robust; and (8) Electro-magnetic interference shielding.  In addition, the CTI's WindTracer® system pulses the laser at 500 Hz, spatially samples at each scanner elevation angle at 20 Hz, then vary the scanning angles to form complete wake scans at every 5 seconds.  By deploying over-lapping range gates processing, the localization ability of the system can achieve an uncertainty level of only 5 meters and has the ability to perform multiple azimuthal scans to extract wake information over a large airspace.  The period of performance is estimated to be 12 months from date of award.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541710 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PRO POSALS.  Interested firms have 15 calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the above named point of contact, clear and convincing documentation of their company's off-the-shelf LIDAR system with wake vortex capability meeting the aforementioned minimum requirements and delivery schedule.  Such documentation will be utilized solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses received after 15 calendar days, or without the required documentation, will be considered non-responsive to this synopsis and shall not be considered.  The Government shall not pay for any documentation provided in response to this synopsis and documentation received will not be returned to the sender.  A determi nation by the Government not to compete this requirement on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses received to this synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Telephone calls in place of required documentation is not acceptable.  For future information about the Volpe Center refer to the Volpe Center website at http://www.volpe.dot.gov.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerates the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  HSARPA is the external funding arm for the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate.  HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research and prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities._____
A critical area of focus for the DHS S&T program is the development of radiological and nuclear countermeasure systems that improve the US capability to address the threat of terrorist use of a radiological dispersal device (RDD), improvised nuclear device (IND) or nuclear weapons in the US through a comprehensive systems approach that emphasizes early detection and effective intervention capabilities at the Federal, state and local levels as well as post-event capabilities for remediation.  In the Radiological and Nuclear Countermeasure System Architectures Analysis (RNCSAA) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which will follow from this Draft Statement of Work for Comment (DSWC), HSARPA plans to solicit an architecture study team to evaluate RDD and IND countermeasures.  The RNCSAA study will evaluate the currently deployed countermeasure architecture, extensions in scale and scope of the current architecture, and future architectures either defined by the government or developed by the study team.  HSARPA anticipates that this will be a multi-year effort with interim deliverables._____ 
This DSWC is intended to seek comments from potential bidders on the Draft Statement of Work, level of effort, and deliverables for a multi-year RNCSAA study.  The goal of this DSWC is to encourage a dialogue with potential bidders and other communities of interest to facilitate a future RNCSAA BAA._____ 
The RNSCAA BAA will be classified.  Only bidders who meet the security requirements for this BAA will be eligible to receive the solicitation documentation and bid on the effort._____ 
Attached to this announcement is the Draft Statement of Work for Comment.  Additional information regarding this DSWC may be requested by email from BAA04-01@dhs.gov.

<DESC>Offshore Petroleum Discharge System(s) (OPDS) consisting of U.S.-flag self-sustaining vessel(s) and associated equipment for the deployment, operation, and redeployment of OPDS in support of the Defense Energy Support Center's Prepositioning Program.  See attached DRAFT Request for Proposals (RFP).  Although the closing date reads 21 November 2003 there has been no closing date established.  However, MSC requests questions/comments by 21 November 2003 and anticipates that an RFP will be issued shortly thereafter, will close during January 2004, and will be awarded in July 2004.  It is anticipated that the charter period will be 12-months firm with three 12-month options and one 11-month option.  After award, but prior to acceptance by the Government, the Contractor will be required to demonstrate that their system meets all of the minimum technical capabilities, as well as any other operating capabilities, as described in the Contractor's proposal.   Based on today’s technology, MSC considers Dynamic Positioning to be a realistic approach to the vessel requirement for maintaining a fixed position and deploying hose.  Considering the sea state (wind and current) parameters set up for deployment and operation, MSC is skeptical that mooring is an acceptable solution.  However, with proper justification and documentation msc will consider alternate methods.  Your attention is drawn to Part I, Box 18, which asks that you provide the end of charter purchase price for the vessel(s) and hose system (Note: This option may be exercised at the Government's sole discretion) and that you provide any fees required, should the Government not exercise any option

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division intends to negotiate and award a cost plus fixed fee/IDIQ task order under Basic Ordering Agreement N68936-99-G-0102, using other than full and open competition.  Negotiations will be conducted with AAI Corporation, P. O. Box 126, Hunt Valley, MD 21030-0126, in order to procure engineering technical services to support hardware and software for use with the Joint Service Electronic Combat System Tester (JSECST) family of diagnostic support equipment.  The JSECST is used to sustain readiness and maintainability of electronic combat (EC) systems and its program’s objective is to provide the flight line with an end-to-end test set that is capable of verifying EC systems operational status and providing malfunction diagnostics.  To meet this objective the AN/USM-670 requires an Organizational-Level Electronic Warfare Test Program Set (OEWTPS), which tailors its inherent capabilities towards a specific application.  The specific OEWTPS requirements are identified as offloads from the existing equipment, and targeted platforms for offloads are F/A-18C/D/E/F, F-18 RECCE, F-14A/B, F-14D, AV-8B, EA-6B, and E-2C.  Additionally, there are new OEWTPS requirements for the following platforms; V-22, H-47, and H-60.  The engineering services for JSECST include OEWTPS software development, JSECST technical support, Electronic Warfare Support Equipment prototype development, and technical support related to the design and development of the O-Level Electronic Warfare Test Program Sets using the AN/USM-670 Test Set, including technical support during verification, validation and operational test for targeted platforms.  As the designer and developer of the AN/USM-670 JSECST, AAI Corporation possesses the unique technical and engineering expertise as well as the technical data package for the JSECST, including data not delivered to the government.  The government anticipates awarding a 21-month task order during March 2004.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm, other than AAI Corporation should respond in accordance with Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Pablo Aramburu Gardener, Director General de Transporte Acuático, Ministerio de Transportes y Comunicaciones, Av. 28 de Julio, #800, Lima 1 -  Perú, Phone:  011 511 433 4437, Email: paramburu@mtc.gob.pe  or evega@mtc.gob.pe, Fax  011 511 433 6870.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide a feasibility study to the Ministerio de Transportes y Comunicaciones (MTC), in the assessment of the technical, economic and financial viability of planning and designing modern cargo handling terminals.

The Port of Callao plays a major role in the economy of Peru.  It serves as the principal port in the country, and is one of the largest ports on the Pacific coast of Latin America.  Most of the existing port was built during 1928 to 1934, and currently uses equipment of 1998 vintage.  According to MTC, the port handles 72% of Peru’s foreign commerce and more than 60% of exports. However, given that the present container facilities have a working capacity of approximately 400,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), the port is lacking in competitiveness with other facilities.  Additionally, the situation at the Port of Callao has reached a critical stage as demand has moved to 550,000 TEUs.  Recently, the Peruvian government drafted laws and regulations related to privatization that are designed to help bring the port up to international standards and attract external sources of financing.  In anticipation of growing demand and lack of resources, the MTC is making serious efforts to alleviate the Port of Callao’s intolerable congestion by providing more modern solutions to maritime traffic and vessels.  In the interest of initiating progress on a Port Master Plan as quickly as possible, the MTC has decided to have its current, outdated plan brought up to international standards.  

The MTC has requested U.S. Trade and Developmenty Agency (USTDA) funding support in order to help reach its goal of developing complete and modern container facilities.  The USTDA grant will fund a feasibility study that will re-evaluate an outdated Master Plan, allowing MTC to validate the usefulness of previous results and move forward with the construction of a new container terminal.  The feasibility study will also include recommendations for integrating future development projects with the new container terminal.  The MTC wants to have a definitive approach for the port’s development for handling more containers, grains, and other cargos, thus the feasibility study will assist in updating the current criteria, and define the definition of current and alternative projects, in addition to providing a validation of previously completed work. 

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the feasibility study include the following: 

Task 1:	Review Existing Studies and Cargo Forecast and Perform a Market Analysis
Task 2:	Perform Engineering Studies and Develop Project Plans and Design Criteria
Task 3:		Develop Project Financing and Schedule
Task 4:		Investigate the Environmental Aspects for Project Development
Task 5:		Prepare Interim and Final Reports and Presentations

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $300,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

IMPORTANT:  This Feasibility Study will require travel to Peru. 

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM local Lima, Peru time, December 16, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR)***
Effective October 1, 2003, all vendors that do business with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Federal Government must be registered in CCR.  Contractors are strongly encouraged to register with CCR now to avoid payment delays.  Changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) require, among other things, that contractors be registered in the CCR before award of any contract, basic agreement, blanket purchase agreements, or basic ordering agreement can be made, and that contract payments and/or new awards will be conditioned on CCR registration.  The FAR change will also require that contractors with existing contracts that require performance after September 30, 2003, register in the CCR.  There are 5 exceptions to the CCR registration requirement, including purchases that use the government-wide purchase cards as the purchasing mechanism, certain emergency operations and urgent procurements, certain purchases where CCR registration could jeopardize national security, and awards to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States. 
The preferred method for completing a registration is via the World Wide Web at http://www.ccr.gov.  There, a CCR Handbook is available to provide detailed information on data you will need prior to beginning the on-line registration, as well as steps to walk you through the registration process.  You must have a DUNS number in order to begin your registration.  If you do not already have a DUNS number, please call Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., at 1-866-705-5711 or  610-882-7000. There is no cost to obtain a DUNS number.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for the verification and validation of documents for the NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) computational fire model.

The purpose of this task is to document past work conducted by NIST and others to verify and validate the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) computational fire model.  The documentation should follow the outline of ASTM 1355, “Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Deterministic Fire Models.” The first step in the ASTM 1355 process is to define the scenarios for which the verification and validation is to be conducted.  These scenarios should be those for which the code was developed for use in the built environment, and should not include any scenarios specific to nuclear power plants.  The documentation should only include validation (comparison of FDS results with test data) that have already been conducted and published by NIST and others.  

Details of this requirement will be provided in the solicitation.  The period of performance for this requirement will be two (2) months from the date of award.  Award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) commercial Purchase Order is anticipated.  It is anticipated that a single solicitation will be issued on or about November 26, 2003 at www.fedbizopps.gov.  The solicitation, all amendments and any questions and answers to the solicitation will be posted to FEDBIZOPPS and are totally the responsibility of the Offeror.  No mailing lists will be kept and no hard copy of the RFQ will be available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Q1.     The RFP refers to a 50-mile radius of the project.  Our firm is located slightly outside of this radius.  Based on this component, we are unsure if it is in our best interest to submit or not, as we are unsure of the weight of importance placed on this factor.  Any recommendations you can offer regarding this issue would be greatly appreciated. A1. Firms will initially be considered within the 50-mile radius. Q2.   We understand that a local firm previously completed a conceptual study for this project.  Does this work make them a more or less likely candidate for the design portion of the project? A2. The firm that completed the conceptual study is not precluded from applying for this requirement. All qualified firms will be considered equally based on the evaluation factors. Q3.     Because we are unfamiliar with the proposal submission process for federal work, we are unsure of all the bases we need to cover.  Are there any general guidelines available outlining what steps we need to take to be eligible to apply? A3. All firms who submit Standard Form (SF) 254 and Standard Form (SF) 254 will be considered based on the evaluation factors. The initial submittal only includes these forms. No other material is desired or will be accepted. Please note that the forms are available on the GSA forms web site at: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?pageTypeId=8199&channelPage=/ep/channel/gsaOverview.jsp&channelId=-13253 Q4. In researching the project on the website, we found a notice that indicated our firm needed to be registered on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website.

<DESC>Statement of Work:
The Prepositioned Equipment Program

1.  Introduction.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP Program.  These tasks UNDER THIS sow are the logical extension of the Prepositioned Emergency Response Equipment Study and are intended to continue execution and sustainment of the Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for First Responders on behalf of Wackenhut Services Inc.

2.  Background.  In the FY 2001 Appropriations Bill for Justice, the Joint Conference report indicated that the Appropriations Committee was aware of unfunded requirements for equipping State and local emergency first responders to deal with a Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) terrorist incident.  The Committee directed the creation of a Federal prepositioned equipment program to sustain State and local first responders.

To develop the concept for an effective prepositioned equipment program for emergency first responders, the Department of Justice Office for State and Local Domestic Preparedness Support (since renamed the Office for Domestic Preparedness and transferred to the Department of Homeland Security) formed a study team and an advisory working group comprising select senior emergency responder subject matter experts from major metropolitan areas across the country.  Five sub-groups, Command and Control, Equipment, Logistics, Medical, and Federal Partners, each led by an experienced member of the emergency response community, focused on key aspects of the concept.  Sub-panels prepared draft concepts for defining the PEP program within their functional area of responsibility.  The study team integrated the findings and recommendations of the sub-panels to provide an integrated baseline approach for the program.  This effort resulted in the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for Emergency First Responders Report to Congress. 

The Report to Congress constituted Phase I in the development of the PEP program for the First Responders.  Subsequent Phases focus on the implementation and sustainment of the Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP).

3.	Purpose.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP Program.  

4.	Objectives and Scope.  This SOW has the following objectives: 1) to provide administrative support to sustain the PEP program, 2) to develop, implement and sustain the information technology support required to support the program.   In addition, office space for the Wackenhut Program Coordinator and Facility Manager will be provided by the successful bidder. 

5.	Accomplishments.  Two pivotal accomplishments guide this project:

·	the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for Emergency First Responders Report to Congress, and,

·	the WMD Prepositioned Program (PEP) Operations Manual has been written and is awaiting publication by the Department of Homeland Security.

6.   Methodology.  Provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP program through the integration with other complimentary activities and closely coordinate with key interagency participants in the national approach to the WMD terrorist threat.   

7.  Subtasks.  This SOW consists of four tasks.  Specific tasks are as follows:

Subtask 1 – DEVELOP PLANS AND STANDING OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPs) FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PEP

Develop, as directed by WSI, plans and procedures that will ensure the timely and efficient implementation of the PEP program and will continually refine these plans and procedures as experience with the program identifies improved operational methods.  These plans and procedures shall include provisions for guidance in the functional areas of: facilities management, safety, security, training, Information Technology (IT), and program management support.   

Functions shall include: 

·	conduct background research, data collection, and liaison with stakeholder Federal, State, and local government agencies and commercial partners to support the development of plans and SOPs;
·	validate plans and SOPs through Integrated Process Teams (IPTs) or other forums such as limited gaming events or exercises;
·	facilitate meetings of the PEP working group: prepare agenda, arrange accommodations, develop briefing materials, and prepare minutes of the proceedings; 
·	provide IT support such as desk top publishing; and,
·	prepare documentation.

Potential products could be manuals and SOPs, monthly reports and working group meeting support.

Subtask 2 – COORDINATING EXECUTION OF SELECT PEP IMPLEMENTATION PLANS

Field a PEP capability that will provide federal support to State and local WMD emergency first responders.  This capability includes pre-positioned equipment that is prepared for delivery, where / when needed, and as directed by the cognizant federal authority.  Funchtions shall include:
·	coordinate PEP data collection to ensure the adequacy of the inventory, i.e., quantity, packaging, materiel management and planned transportation of the PEP materiel.  This information will facilitate the efficient expenditure of resources when procuring the remaining PEP Pods; and,
·	adequate IT for materiel management of the prepositioned equipment.

Potential products include the review / update of plans and SOPs.
 
Subtask 3 – PROVIDE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT FOR THE PEP STORAGE SITES NATIONWIDE. 

	Coordinate the required hardware, software 
and  internet connections to maximize the efficient operation of the various storage sites.  This task will also involve the development, and maintenance of a PEP web site.  Functions shall include:

survey 	each site to determine the most cost effective approach to implement a local area network and to connect the site to the internet;

coordinate the installation of telephone and high speed internet connectivity through the WSI, General Services Administration telephone point of contact;

coordinate the procurement of hardware specific to the requirements at each site through the Marine Corps Systems Command PEP Prime Vendor point of contact;

install the hardware and test the operability of the local area network and the internet connection.

staff a computer support help desk to provide assistance to the storage sites whenever they experience problems with their connectivity;

complete the development of the PEP web site, insure compatibility with the Department of Homeland Security web site protocols, serve as the web site administrator, and, continually update the data posted on the web site.
Subtask 4 – COORDINATE THE TRAINING REQUIRED TO DEPLOY THE PRE-POSITIONED EQUIPMENT TO SUPPORT STATE AND LOCAL WMD FIRST RESPONDERS.

This task will include the provision of technical and management support to ensure that Federal, state, and local government agencies, and commercial partners, are thoroughly trained in all activities required to execute a timely deployment of the PEP program capability.  This task will ensure continued and effective utilization of resources through oversight of an integrated training and exercise program.  All PEP training will utilize the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium and other national resources.  The lead for PEP training has been assigned to the Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX) and the National Emergency Response and Rescue Training Center (NERRTC) of Texas A&M.  The training will entail the processes involved in requesting, deploying, receiving, and retrograding Pods from their storage sites.  

The successful bidder will perform activities that could include:

·	coordinate the development of exercise scenarios and processes for use in training federal, state and local government agencies, and commercial partners in the processes necessary to effectively deploy the WMD PEP program capability;

·	participate in training exercises for Federal, State, and local government agencies, commercial partners and PEP support teams to validate processes for continued use during the periodic training required over the life of the PEP program.  These exercises will likely be conducted in conjunction with ongoing activities such as the support provided for National Special Security Events.

Potential products include coordinated plans for training and exercises and summary reports of exercise observations and recommendations.

Summary of Products.  Products will be provided, as directed, and could include the following: 

Operations Manual & SOPs
Review / update of the manual and SOPs
Draft policy and procedures, schedules, and a maintenance database

<DESC>NOTE:  THIS SYNOPSIS HAS CHANGED AND WILL BE SUPERCEDED BY SOLICITATION #FA8617-04-R-6150 WHICH SHOULD BE POSTED BY  14 NOVEMBER 03. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft  Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting a market  survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS)  of theT-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate a 10-year Firm- Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/  Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with contract award  approximately 31 December 2004.    The T-6A is a derivative of the Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or commercially  available items to meet most system requirements.  The T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary training aircraft.  The T-6A is a low wing, high  performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.  The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments,  formation, and navigation during both day and night  conditions.   T-6A training will lead to a level of  proficiency that permits transition into one of the USAF or  USN advanced pilot training tracks.   The T-6As are presently stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support contract (through FY 2014), there will be 782 aircraft in  the field at these additional bases: Sheppard AFB, Texas;  Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus AFB, Mississippi; NAS  Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus Christi, Texas.   The CLS follow-on contract will include on-equipment  maintenance, off-equipment maintenance, component repair,  engine repair, material support services, Contractor  Operated Managed Base Supply (COMBS) and contractor field  teams.  The USAF has a two-level maintenance concept  organizational and depot).  Organizational-level  maintenance (on-equipment and selected off-equipment tasks)  will be performed by a mix of contractor and/or civil service personnel.  The remaining depot level maintenance  off-equipment) will be provided through the CLS follow-on  contract. The USN has a three-level maintenance concept,  using contractor-performed (a) organizational,  (b) intermediate, and (c) depot level maintenance.  The CLS  contractor will manage, schedule and provide all  maintenance and material support services, including  quality control in accordance with the manufacturer’s  applicable approved maintenance requirements for the  aircraft.   At a minimum, the CLS contractor will need associate  contractor agreements with the aircraft manufacture/  sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  A majority of parts are available  only from Raytheon Aircraft Company. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  It is a  market research tool to determine the availability and  adequacy of potential sources.  Firms responding to this  announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service  disabled veteran-owned small business.  The North American  Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 336411,  Aircraft Manufacturing, applies to this acquisition with a  size standard of 1,500 employees.  All prospective  contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract.   Interested sources are encouraged to first register as  source on the PIXS Web Site (http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil). In addition, interested firms should submit sufficient  information that will permit evaluation of technical  capabilities.

<CONTACT>MELISSA W. GILL CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487368     mgill@usgs.gov;
<DESC>This is not a notice for a solicitation.  This is only a Request For Information (RFI).  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation to bid; merely a request for information.  Neither a draft statement of work nor a complete specification is available at this time.  However, a high-level functional requirement based on some preliminary analysis will be available upon request by contacting mgill@usgs.gov.  The U.S. Geological Survey is interested in exploring technologies and solutions that can help the organization manage content on its web sites more effectively and efficiently.  Specifically the organization is interested in developing and incrementally deploying a multi-tier enterprise Web Content Management (WCM) system using a role-based framework to formalize and more effectively manage the USGS's web publishing life-cycle to assure content quality, timeliness, usability, accessibility, and accountability.  This will ensure that anyone can find, get, and use USGS information in ways that are meaningful to them and with full confidence that the information is the most up-to-date and of the highest possible quality.  USGS serves its information on the web through a wide network of more than 300 web servers distributed across the 50 states.  The content on these sites focus on natural sciences that includes hydrology, geology, geography, and biology.  The complexity of topics range from highly technical information to educational information.  The audience includes scientists, students, recreationists, and congressional staff members.  The purpose of this RFI is to seek information from the industry to assist the agency in the development and deployment of web content management strategy and system(s).  The responses to this RFI should include (1) technical architecture alternatives (e.g. centralized vs. distributed); (2) address content delivery (output), content authoring and acquisition, content management repository and interoperability and scalability as related to WCM; (3) technical feasibility of the proposed solution; (4) for products, descriptions of features including discussion of available "out of the box" and customizable features; (5) approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, maintenance fee) that is limited to the product cost and initial cost of implementation; (6) discussion of the licensing structure (e.g. enterprise license, per user license, base license with the ability to add additional licenses for additional functional modules/users); (7) information that would be useful in procuring products/services; and (8) company contact information.  The response format should not exceed 20 pages including figures.  Company and product brochures are not acceptable as part of the response.  The response should be prepared using Microsoft Word.  Questions and all responses should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Melissa W. Gill, at mgill@usgs.gov.  Responses are due no later than close of business on December 15, 2003.  Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release.

<DESC>Purpose of Request for Information (RFI):  United Space Alliance (USA), LLC, through its offices located in Houston, Texas is soliciting information from potential Offerors for the acquisition of a Space Shuttle Advanced Hydraulic Power System (AHPS) Battery System.	The objective of this RFI is to invite potential Offerors to submit information that allows USA to conduct a technical and capabilities assessment of Offerors, and to promote competition and teaming.  USA anticipates the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP), on or about January 7, 2004, for the acquisition of the AHPS Battery System.  The potential award is anticipated to be based upon competition.   The RFP will contain the selection criteria. Program Description:  The Space Shuttle Orbiter AHPS Project is a high priority upgrade to improve safety, reliability, and operability by replacing the existing hydrazine-fueled, high-speed turbine Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) with an electric motor and power supply.  All performance requirements of the current APU shall be met by the AHPS.  In addition, the AHPS will have greater redundant capability then the existing APU, and provide increased hydraulic flow capability.  The upgrade will eliminate the toxic and hazardous potential of hydrazine on the ground and in space as well as the potential safety hazards associated with the high-speed turbines.  Each AHPS subsystem is comprised of a Battery Assembly, 270 VDC electrical power distribution and control hardware, Electro-Hydraulic Drive Unit (EHDU), and it’s associated cooling hardware.  There are three (3) AHPS subsystems in the Orbiter.  The three (3) Battery Assemblies comprise the Battery System.  The effort required for the Battery System includes design, development, certification, and delivery of hardware for three (3) Orbiters and the initial lay-in spares.	The total quantity of Battery Assemblies includes nine (9) flight units, three (3) spares, three (3) development units, and four (4) qualification units.  The first set of flight hardware is to be delivered in late 2008 in order to support completion of implementation into the first Orbiter by 2009. The RFP will request two Battery System approaches that will be acceptable to the AHPS Project.  Offerors can propose a single concept approach or both approaches in their offer.  The two concept approaches are defined, but not limited to, the following requirements as follows: 1.  A Battery Assembly defined as eighty-two (82) 120 Ah Li-Ion Secondary cells with performance characteristics of operating time of 6 missions with between flight recharging or 3 years, whichever comes first without replacement, battery output voltage of 270 +85/-40 VDC at EHDU interface for loads up to 125 Kw, energy of 30 KwH, and a Battery Assembly weight of 410 kg (1230 kg for a Battery System). 2.  A Battery Assembly defined as commercially available 18650 Li-Ion Secondary cells with performance characteristics of operating time of 6 missions with between flight recharging or 3 years, whichever comes first without replacement, battery output voltage of 270 +85/-40 VDC at EHDU interface for loads up to 125 Kw, energy of 30 KwH, and a Battery Assembly weight of 410 kg (1230 kg for a Battery System). Procurement Strategy:  USA is responsible for overall program management and integration of the AHPS upgrade.  Hamilton Sundstrand, Rockford, IL, will be responsible for the AHPS Subsystem Integration.  USA will solicit the participation of Subcontractors in order to select the provider for the Battery System.	The responsibilities of the AHPS Battery System Subcontractor will include battery system design and integration, support for the AHPS certification, support during AHPS subsystem integration, and support during AHPS vehicle integration.  The period of performance for the Subcontractor is the entire Implementation Phase (Phase IV) of the project, anticipated to be from July 2005 through the first flight of the first modified vehicle plus 30 days for post flight data reduction and anomaly resolution.	 First flight is scheduled for 2010.

<RESPDATE>120103
<ARCHDATE>01302004
<CONTACT>Peggy Melanson, 703-325-6096
<DESC>NA REVISED: The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington (CAC-W) on behalf of the US Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Communications and Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CE RDEC), Science and Technology Division, Countermine Branch, is conducting market research to identify contractors having qualifications and capabilities to conduct research and development of imaging hyperspectral airborne sensor and associated processing technology as discussed below. Contractors should have demonstrated experience in airborne mine detection.  Contractors must have the capability to collect airborne hyperspectral sensor imagery with existing assets on a contractor furnished airframe, and h ave the technical personnel and lab capability to further develop and modify sensors as described below. The goal of this research and development effort is to test and assess hyperspectral sensor technologies and algorithms which provide phenomenology and  signature exploitation for detection of surface-laid and recently-buried metal and plastic antitank landmines from an airborne platform. The general approach is to perform airborne data collections over multiple government-supplied test sites to develop a  landmine signature database, perform analysis on these and other hyperspectral both for sensor evaluation and to design optimized algorithms for mine detection and clutter rejection, provide georegistered imagery and detection statistics to the government  for analysis and scoring, evaluate and modify sensor designs based on test results . Ultimately the goal is to provide recommended sensor design specifications and optimized mine/clutter detection algorithms to the follow-on 6.3 effort. The Government con siders this to be a 24-month effort, to start in 2QFY04 (subject to availability of funds). Performance Objectives: Sensor spectral ranges: 400-2300 nm preferred, 400-800 nm necessary for VNIR sensor, 8-11 um for LWIR sensor; capability to add color linesc anner boresighted with other sensors; VNIR/SWIR sensor spectral resolution less than or equal to 10 nm; LWIR sensor spectral resolution less than or equal to 75 nm; number of spectral bands greater than or equal to 40; platform altitude greater than or equ al to 1,000 feet; pixel resolution on ground less than or equal to 5 inches swath width on ground greater than 200 feet; georeference image pixel location error less than or equal to 3 meter. Technical Thrusts: (a) Airborne data collections with currently existing hyperspectral (LWIR, VNIR/SWIR) and active airborne imaging sensors. The system must currently be capable of collecting VNIR hyperspectral data (400-800 nm), with capability to extend to the SWIR (400-2300 nm) (b) Also capable to perform airborne data collections with LWIR hyperspectral (8-12 um) and a VNIR/SWIR active imag ing sensor (c) Signal processing and automatic target detection for landmine signature characterization and phenomenology understanding; must develop capability for sub-pixel ta rget detection, (d) Modifications to existing sensor hardware as government det ermines from results of processing test imagery.
