Interested firms with more than one office must indicate on their SF330 the staffing composition of the office in which the work will be performed. The primary factors for consideration are: 1) Local firms licensed by the State of California. Firms will be considered local only if their main office is within 25 miles of Santa Barbara Main Office. 2) Prime firm must have a minimum of 2 registered architects. 3) Firm must have been established for a minimum of five (5) years and have extensive experience in designing and supporting new construction projects, repair & alteration projects and other projects similar in nature to those executed by the U. S.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to contract with, on a sole source basis, the Association of State and Territorial Public Health Nutrition Directors (ASTPHND), Johnstown, PA.  This contract will be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.302-1.  The anticipated contract period is for a twelve month base year with two twelve month option years.  The purpose of this proposed contract is to implement the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Blueprint for Nutrition and Physical Activity in up to 30 states.  ASTPHND is a 501(c)3 non-profit national organization representing state nutrition directors and professionals working in MCH nutrition, chronic disease prevention, 5 a Day, WIC, obesity prevention and other nutrition-related public health programming.  ASTPHND has established a unique network of public health nutritionists that include 2,200 state-level nutrition professionals and over 10,000 nutrition personnel in local communities working to improve the health of the American population through statewide and local community efforts. The ASTPHND is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the required services as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 because as a state health nutrition membership organization it is the only entity that has the contacts, required substantial body of information, and credibility for the government to implement this project.  Award of a contract to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government since other organizations would need to attain the necessary skills, capabilities, and organization relationships needed for this requirement.   This is not a solicitation but an announcement of the Government's intent to contract on a sole source basis.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Screening Information Request (SIR)  to seek qualified sources for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of the Chief Information Officer to provide network integration and installation services as outlined herein .  This is an unrestricted procurement and all interested companies are invited to participate.  Any and all updates to this request will be posted to the Government Point of Entry at www.fbo.gov.  Interested parties are encouraged to check www.fbo.gov frequently for possible updates.  While any and all questions must be directed to one of the Government points of contact identified in this announcement, answers to those questions, as well as any and all clarifications, extensions or changes will be posted to www.fbo.gov and will only be available at www.fbo.gov prior to the closing date and time of the this notice.

This procurement will be conducted using the Transportation Security Administration Acquisition Management System (TSAAMS).  Interested parties may learn more about the Acquisition Management System at http://fast.faa.gov.  TSA is exempted from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA – Public Law 107-71) and empowered to use TSAAMS by the same authority.   Specifically, FAR Part 15 does not apply under TSAAMS and “full and open competition” is replaced with a screening process which authorizes the TSA to perform a down-select which limits the participation in the next phase (i.e., Request for Proposal) to only those offerors who are determined most likely to receive award.


Background:

The Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has a requirement for an integration and installation services provider to design, integrate and deploy Local Area Networks to 358 categories II, III, and IV federalized airports worldwide (attached is the complete listing of all airports for this requirement and there location).  The selected provider will build on the infrastructure currently installed at the airports by the TSA Information Technology Managed Services LAN/WAN deployment and the Hi-Speed Operational Connectivity (Hi-SOC) “User Connectivity (Hi-SOC Phase II)” projects.

	The selected provider will develop a proposal for overall integration and project management activities and individual site specific statements of work (SOW) using the information and assumptions contained in the TSA Hi-SOC Project SOW, “as built” documentation provided by TSA as well as information from site visits and site specific government developed SOW’s.

	With oversight from TSA, the selected provider is responsible for all activities and coordination pursuant to the installation of the horizontal cable plant and interconnectivity to the TSA Wide Area Network (WAN).  All structured cabling will comply with the TSA Structured Cabling manual, IEEE 802.3 standards, local building and electrical codes, and industry best practices.  

	The installation scope provides LAN connectivity to all TSA controlled areas and interface with the TSA WAN based on information and assumptions contained in the TSA Hi-SOC Project SOW to include:

Site Installation will include:
-	Installation of switches, if they do not already exist, into the cabinets installed by the Site Preparation contractor.
-	Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), which is required to be installed in every rack location.  These UPSs should be obtained from the WWT or purchased as part of the rack installation, if they do not already exist in the racks. 
	The authorized models are:
-	APC SUA1500RM2U with optional AP9619 Network Monitoring Card w/temperature sensor.  This model will power a basic router, switch, and out-of-band equipment and requires a standard 20 amp outlet
-	APC SUA3000RM2U with optional AP9619 Network Monitoring Card w/temperature sensor. This model will generally power a core rack with router, multiple switches, and out-of-band equipment. It requires a 30 amp twist lock outlet.
-	Either model should be able to power normal VoIP installations.
-	If a 30 amp circuit already exists, then use the SUA3000. Otherwise, use the appropriate UPS for the installation.  Do not use an SUA1500 if the SUA3000 is required.
-	No additional batteries, no extended warranty, no additional software is required.
-	For those devices with dual power supplies, only one should be connected to the UPS.  The other should use direct power, preferably from another outlet/circuit.
-	Testing of connectivity from the device port to the switch/router
-	Testing LAN connectivity and workstation applications to the Hosting Center
-	Migration of users from legacy domain to Network domain
-	Migration of workstation system software, to include from Windows 2000 to Windows XP where required, productivity suite, and any other software noted in the site specific technical proposal for any workstation which is connected to the TSA legacy domain (Red Package).  (Note: For any workstations that are not currently connected to the TSA legacy domain (standalone), a determination will have to be made by Headquarters Operational Effectiveness as to whether these workstations will be replaced with TSA-imaged/approved equipment, or left in place as is in a standalone state.
-	Configuration of proxy settings
-	Migration of user data and email 
-	Update security patches and anti-virus definitions on    workstations
-	Scan for viruses before joining network 
-	Provision and connect all required RJ 45 patch cables for connection of equipment to the wall plates and patch panel
-	Configure and connect workstations and printers
-	Installation and configuration of VoIP phones and service
-	Perform Quality Assurance (QA) test
-	Connection of the Training PC(s)

All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on availability of interested HUBZone concerns.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in a contractor not being considered as an interested HUBZone concern.  If adequate interest is not received from HUBZone concerns, the solicitation will be issued as unrestricted without further notice.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, with a small business size standard of $28,5000,000.00.

The party of participants is comprised of CBP employees, Contractors, and/or representatives from foreign governments, all working on official US Government business.

High quality facilities and relating services are required for this event. Contractor facilities that currently have 3 Star/3 Diamond ratings or higher (for 5 increment rating systems) from organizations such as AAA, OAG, Travelocity, Orbitz, etc. are desired. See statement of work and the evaluation of quotations section of the solicitation document for details.

This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer/quotation that requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.

CBP is a federal government agency and as such is exempt from most sales and occupancy taxes for goods and services it acquires directly, via purchase order as in this case. A NY State tax exemption form (ST-129) will be completed and submitted to the successful Contractor after award. 

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested via the relating solicitation that has been uploaded at this website, RFQ HSBP1006Q0793. This is an RFQ in accordance with FAR Part 13. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-09 MAY 2006) and the Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR). It is the responsibility of the vendor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. This RFQ will be issued exclusively through this Government Point of Entry (Fedbizopps.gov). All future information about this acquisition including amendments to this procurement requirement will also be distributed through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible vendor whose quotation conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Responses will be evaluated on the basis of best value. Evaluation Factors are Technical Acceptability (required accommodations, services etc.) Past Performance and Price. Technical Acceptability is more important than Past Performance. Both Technical Acceptability and Past Performance are more important than Price. While Technical Acceptability is the most important criteria, CBP still desires to acquire the accomodation services at rates near the current GSA perdiem level ($162.00 for Nassau County).

NOTE: Offerors/Quoters must be registered at     WWW.CCR.GOV in order to be eligible for award and must be in compliance with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (PL101-391).

<SOLNBR>N0016706Q5170
<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison (301)227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), has a requirement for the installation of engineered composite deck drains in which NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to BAE Systems Maritime Engineering & Services (BAE ME&S). BAE Systems Maritime Engineering & Services (BAE ME&S), San Diego, have been under contract to NAVSEA 05M and NSWCCD during the development and demonstrations of this technology on active Navy amphibious ships with great success. They were responsible for overseeing the successful installations of fifteen prototype D-Type deck drain designs on the USS Peleliu, LHA-5, May 2004,. They have also continued to monitor the ‘health’ of these systems since installation and maintained the departure from specification requirements with Southwest Regional Maintenance Center, San Diego, since the initial installations. This is a follow-on effort to previous work and due to intimate knowledge with the current composite deck drain designs, award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost and efforts to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to the Government POC on or before 07/07/2006.

NSWC is currently upgrading existing boats in the fleet and outfitting new SDV boats.  This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reason.  The SDV was originally outfitted with cables and cable assemblies produced by SeaCon Brantner.  Requested material will be used with existing hardware and has already been through operational and technical evaluation for certification.  Once a system is certified nothing can be altered without approval from project engineers.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly to the government and to the mission. Any variance in the parts used on certified systems would jeopardize the certification of the syste!  ms and ultimately the mission.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Centers (COAC) has a requirement for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a non-competitive award to the National Council of La Raza Institute for Hispanic Health (NCLR-IHH), 1126 16th Street North West, Washington, DC 20036  to expand upon an existing collaboration between the NHGRI and NCLR-IHH to research, design and develop a culturally-appropriate genetics education tool for use with Spanish-speaking immigrants in community settings.  The NCLR-IHH organization is the leading advocacy organization for Hispanic health issues in the United States and has established partnerships with a large national network of community health centers.  Collaborating with NCLR-IHH would allow us unparalleled access to a unique population of immigrants who are not usually included in genetics education research.  We have developed a program with the team at NCLR-IHH and they are familiar with the details of the planned evaluation.  In 2005, with support from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the Office of Rare Diseases (ORD), the National Council of La Raza’s (NCLR’s) Institute for Hispanic Health (IHH) conducted a formative research project to test the effectiveness of community-based promotores de salud (lay health educators) in promoting increased awareness among low-income Latinos about the linkages between genetics and health.  Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were used to assess the promotores’ and target population’s knowledge of genetics and to develop a culturally-sensitive training module and educational materials, which subsequently were tested in two sites (Oakland, CA and Washington, DC).  Materials were tested through charlas (small community educational sessions) conducted by the promotores.  Pre- and post-charla questionnaires were used to evaluate increases in participants’ knowledge and to measure indicators of potential subsequent behavioral change.  FGDs included 58 participants; following a “train the trainers” session, promotores delivered eight charlas to a total of 86 community members.  The critical tasks and activities include: 1) Site Selection: Confirm interest of existing sites/executions of Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs); 2) Materials Development and Reproduction:  Reproduce existing Flip Chart and training manual; 3) Field testing: a) Develop expanded evaluation design, b) “Refresher” training for two existing sites, c) Local sites conduct charlas; 4) Evaluation and follow-up: a) Collect implementation data from sites, b) Collect evaluation data from sites, c)  Analyze evaluation data, the analyze evaluation data, shall include: Evaluate effectiveness of intervention, Compare 2005 and 2006 same-site results, Compare 2006 cross-site results;  d) Identify key findings/lessons.  The Communication Research Section of NHGRI’s Social and Behavioral Research Branch and NCLR-IHH will work with the NCLR-CSULB Center for Latino Health, Evaluation, and Leadership Training (NCLR-CSULB Center) at California State University Long Beach to develop, implement, and analyze an expanded and strengthened evaluation protocol for the project.  Deliveries: Refresher “train the trainer” trainings for promotores at two existing sites;  A total of 15 charlas with an estimated 150 participants completed at the two sites; expanded and strengthened evaluation protocol, with follow-up measurement time point.  Period of performance: the period of performance is from July 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007.  The place of performance is principally at NCLR-IHH in Washington, DC, with support from NCLR-CSULB Center at California State University Long Beach. The determination by the Government not to compete this requirement was based upon NCLR-IHH performance, experience, knowledge and contacts with the Hispanic community programs.  Due to the benefits gained by NHGRI from NCLR-IHH contributions on this program and in order to maintain continuity of the program, an award to any other source for this requirement would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  . This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990.  Size standard $6.5 Million is applicable to this requirement.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  Responses will be evaluated based upon past experience and past performance in research and studies on cultural, genetics and health education between NIH-NHGRI and with NCLR-IHH.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.   Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLB-PS-(HG)-2006-226-CDM   may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, Building RKL2, Suite 6042, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention Ms. Cecilia Morales, Contract specialist.

<CONTACT>BRENDA J. KIMBLE, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 919-541-2897, E-Mail: kimble.joy@epa.gov
<DESC>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with TRC Environmental Corporation, Raleigh, NC for acceptance testing, storing and distribution of teflon filters in support of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC.  EPA is responsible for procuring, testing, and distributing Teflon filters of high purity to the State/Local air pollution control agencies. The Teflon filters are used with a sampler to collect PM 2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers) samples.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks. EPA obtains these filters each year from a filter manufacturer and has them shipped to EPA for acceptance testing and storage.  Once filters are received, EPA has only 120 days to accept or reject the filters.  TRC Environmental has a unique and extensive knowledge and experience of specific test methods used during the acceptance testing phase.   Therefore, the services are deemed to be available only from the original source for this follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services.  If the acceptance testing confirms that the filters meet EPA's specifications for physical and chemical properties, the contractor shall ship the filters to the State/local air pollution control agencies.  The base performance period is for twelve months with an additional optional period of 12 months.  The place of performance is at the contractor's site. The Statement of Work and any subsequent amendments or status may be viewed at http:www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Hard copies, CDs or disketts are not be available.  It will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site for any amendments.  Telephone and FAX requests will not be honored.  No Solicitation is available.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any additional source (s) exist and, therefore, no Request for Proposal (RFP) is available.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities in writing within 15 days of the date of this announcement. Any response (s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter, calling or requesting a FAX copy of an RFP will be ignored. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710, which has a small business size standard of 500 employees. Submit your response no later than 7 July 2006, 3:00 p.m. EST to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP-POD, 109 T.W. Alexander Dr., Attn: Joy Kimble, E105-02,  Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Compliance Division intends to award a sole source firm-fixed-price performance based purchase order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Poles Apart Limited of Cambridge, United Kingdom under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  Antarctica is the coldest, driest, windiest, and most isolated continent on Earth, unique in its physical and biological characteristics.  As a result, the continents climate limits  the presence and activities of humans.  However, following the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957-58 as a result of the upsurge in Antarctic research activity, 12 countries with research and other interests in Antarctica devised arrangements for cooperation that culminated in the  Antarctic Treaty in 1959.  Shortly after, in 1969, the Antarctic Science, Tourism, and Conservation Act established requirements for non-governmental activities in Antarctica.   Following that Act, EPA promulgated regulations at 40 CFR Part 8, Environmental Impact Assessment of Non-Governmental  Activities in Antarctica.  It was determined under this regulation, when the Department of State determines that an expedition is a U.S.-based non-governmental expedition, it is the EPA's responsibility to implement the Act.  Because of the inter-active responsibility between the EPA, the National  Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of State, they work together to review the various documents submitted for any U.S.-based non-governmental expedition.  The purpose of this acquisition is to develop a Guidance Manual for United States Non-governmental Operators Planning Expeditions to  Antarctica.  The Guidance Manual will provide relevant information for these operators to prepare and submit documentation to EPA, NSF, and Department of State for planned expeditions to Antarctica that meet all applicable requirements.  Poles Apart is a U.K.-based group specializing in the world's  extreme environments with its origins lying in Antarctic field operations. The group has been working on Antarctic environmental impact assessment (EIA), Antarctic environmental permit application, Antarctic health and safety assessment, as well as international, national and local Antarctic  legislation review since 1986.  Poles Apart has prepared EIA documents for non-governmental operators planning expeditions to Antarctica, including U.S.-based operators.  Poles Apart is highly experienced with the EIA process and documentation requirements for land-based and cruise expeditions,  including those of the U.S.  The group also has an understanding of the current issues facing non-governmental operators in Antarctica as they spend significant time in Antarctica on airplanes and ships each year, and they are represented at the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.  In  addition, EPA has conducted market research by searching the internet and contacting the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO).  EPA did not find any additional sources through the internet search.  The Project Officer spoke to the Executive Director at IAATO who did not  know of anyone else who could do this work.  IAATO is a member organization founded in 1991 to advocate, promote and practice safe and environmentally responsible private-sector travel to Antarctica.  IAATO submits a programmatic environmental impact assessment to EPA on behalf of its members, and  its members are made up of the U.S. operators regulated by EPA, NSF, and the Department of State.  The manual is intended to provide guidance to these U.S. operators, and therefore it would not be appropriate to have the regulated community or IAATO as a representative of the regulated community,  prepare this document.  In addition, IAATO does not have staff resources available for these types of services.  EPA is  not aware of anyone offering services  that  has experience in environmental impact assessment for both non-governmental land-based and cruise expeditions in Antarctica necessary  to develop this guidance manual.  Also, EPA is  not aware of anyone offering services  with experience and understanding of the U.S. government procedures for the environmental impact assessment of non-governmental activities in Antarctica necessary to develop this guidance manual.  Poles Apart has  been writing environmental impact assessments for expeditions to Antarctica since before the Protocol was ratified in 1992.  The company also has an understanding of the current issues facing non-governmental operators in Antarctica as they spend significant time in Antarctica on airplanes and  ships each year, and they are represented at the annual Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.  Therefore, it has been determined that Poles Apart Limited is the only viable source to meet the Government's requirements.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding,  any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calender days of the date of this announcement will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the proposed  purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Rebecca Hindin via e-mail at hindin.rebecca@epa.gov.

         National Flood Control and Drought Relief Command System Demonstration Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance to examine the system components, requirements and design, as well as economic, financial, developmental and environmental feasibility of a flood control and command system in China.

Mitigating the catastrophic consequences of China’s recurrent cycle of flood and drought is one of the country’s most pressing development priorities.  To reduce human and economic losses caused by annual floods and droughts, the Chinese government has embarked on the implementation of a National Flood Control and Drought Relief Command System. The Project requires the installation of a national flood management system, consisting of 5 subsystems, including a data collection system, a communications system, a computer network system, a decision-support system, and a new-generation weather radar application system. The installation of such systems would enable Chinese authorities to monitor meteorological and flood zone conditions, provide advanced warning to threatened populations and ensure that local, regional and central authority responses are instantaneous and coordinated based on advanced information and decision support tools. 

Amongst these subsystems, the simulation-based decision-support system is considered the most crucial part of the project.  For the implementation of this system, the Ministry of Water Resources of Chinas will principally rely on external expertise to define and source the goods and services suitable for developing the decision support system.   Ministry of Water Resources recognizes that U.S. companies are leaders in the development of flood and natural resource management systems, and intends to incorporate U.S. approaches into its existing systems.  

The lead government agency in China responsible for all water management, the Ministry of Water Resources has requested U.S. Trade and Development Agency’s (USTDA) assistance to support a Study to evaluate and develop the technical aspects of this Project.   This Study will concentrate on the development of the Decision Support System.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $348,185 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 5:00 p.m. Beijing Time, August 25, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The contractor shall provide various mission-based Link 16 data and “ownship” data real-time to 412TW assets to help with this check out.  “Ownship” data is position and weapon system status data that is generated by the aircraft HITL Lab or simulator before it is packaged for transmission on Link-16. These HITL Labs and/or Simulators will be tasked to participate in defined test scenarios to support testing.  In these test scenarios these HITL Labs and/or simulators will be asked to send and receive link 16 data link messages per the scenario.  Message data will be compared with recorded HITL Lab and/or simulator transmitted and received data to verify message traffic between all systems within the network of LVC systems participating in the test.  The period of this effort is from 1 June 2006 to 1 Sept 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Mobile District intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Bellsouth Telecommunications, 2180 Lake Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30319 to provide voice/data communications and equipment for the Mobile District Corps of Engineers pursuant to the a uthority under FAR 6.302.  The service area consists of remote locations throughout Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida for various Corps offices located at parks, locks and dams and military installations.  This service is currently under an A-76 Co mpetitive Study.  The outcome of this study is imminent, and a change at this time would increase cost and the potential for an additional change once the new Service Provider begins service.  Bellsouth has been providing these services to the field office  locations for numerous years and to disrupt service with Bellsouth would impact the Corps by losing service in these remote locations, losing investments in equipment and installation costs and pose compatibility problems between current equipment and rep lacement equipment if another vendor were selected.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposal s received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is soley within the discretion fo the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

A. Specifications

BACKGROUND

NOAA Aircraft Operations Center operates two P-3 aircraft in the support of atmospheric research.  Each aircraft measures and records a variety of atmospheric parameters including liquid water content (LWC), total water content (TWC) and ice water content (IWC).  AOC currently uses two types of sensors for this measurement: a King model LWC-100 and a J&W model LWH.  Both units measure water content using a heated wire technique.  These sensors cannot withstand the heavy precipitation and icing encountered during hurricane research flights.  A more accurate and robust design is needed to provide accurate liquid, ice and total water measurements. Two accepted methods for measuring LWC/TWC are available, optical (droplet size/counting) and hot-wire instruments. Optical sensors require an independent instrument comparison for absolute calibration, have an unknown response in mixed-phase situations (presence of water and ice), and tend to be larger instruments requiring special mounting considerations.   Hot wire instruments provide a fundamental measurement not requiring an independent instrument comparison for calibration (although several error sources must be considered including: measurements of the probe sensor area, resistance of sensor wire at operating temperature, various empirical constants in the heat transfer equations, and collection efficiencies of the wire).  Wire elements come in two types, wire wound and solid wire.  Hot-wire instruments utilizing the wire wound method make use of a fine wire wrapped around a solid core as an integral part of the sensor design.  Exposure of the sensor to heavy precipitation and icing during flight results in damage to the wire and sensor failure.  Replacement wire elements are expensive and replacement is labor intensive.  Solid wire sensors use a thicker gauge solid wire, nickel or stainless steel, to measure water content.  This sensor design is less likely to be damaged by icing or heavy precipitation. The replacement instrument must be a constant-temperature, hot-wire probe designed for aircraft measurements of ice and liquid water content using stainless steel solid wire elements.  It must be capable of withstanding the harsh environment encountered by aircraft during hurricane research missions and meet strict size, power and weight limitations (see attached specifications). The instrument must be capable of measuring over a wide range of medium volume droplet (MVD) sizes to include super-cooled large droplets (SLD).  Capabilities must include the detection and measurements of ice crystals over a wide range of altitudes and airspeeds.  The sensor will be mounted on the aircraft fuselage in place of LWC/TWC sensors currently in use, therefore must be similar in size, fit and form.  Instrument must provide accurate liquid and total water content measurement from 0-10 gms/m3 at true airspeed up to 150 m/s over a flight level of 0 to 45,000 ft. To meet aircraft operational requirements the instrument must require little maintenance and have long term dependability.   Instrument should not require pre and/or post flight calibration or labor intensive operation. Serial output data must be in a usable form for real time display and collection and not require post processing.  Data stream must include LWC, TWC and IWC measurement values.

Requirement:  Multi-Element Water Content Sensor, model WC-2000, manufactured by Science and Engineering Associated or equal with the following salient characteristics:

Liquid and Total Water Content Range: 0-10 gms/m3, @True Airspeed<150 m/s

<DESC>ABSTRACT: Office Equipment Screening Information Request (SIR) Strategic Sourcing Initiative for the procurement of Office Equipment (Nationwide, Alaska, Hawaii & Territories).  Office Equipment under this procurement will primarily consist of Multifunction Devices, Printers, accessories, and maintenance and lease agreements.  The FAA intends to contract with a commercial office equipment company that is on the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule 36 for multifunctional devices (MFDs) and GSA Schedule 70 for printers. Offerors may submit a proposal for either equipment category (MFDs and Printers) or a combined proposal for both.   Requirements for both Office Equipment segments will include shipping and delivery to over 850 facilities located in the 48 contiguous states (includes the strict of Columbia), Alaska, Hawaii, and various U.S. territories in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Pacific (Guam, American Samoa, and Wake Island). The FAA anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm-fixed pricing per line item for the base year and four (4) one-year options.  Currently the estimated annual total of purchases for both Multifunction devices and printers is approximately $8M. This source selection is conducted in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System. Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal is judged to represent the best value to the Government. The FAA reserves the right to award one contract, multiple contracts, or one contract for MFDs and one contract for printers, whichever is in the best interest of the FAA.  The Government reserves the right not to award a contract, depending on the quality of the proposals submitted and the availability of funds.  All interested sources should first download the Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Proposal (RFP) from this site.  All responses to this SIR/request for offer should be submitted electronically per the instructions in the SIR Section L. To submit your electronic proposal, contact the Contracting Officer (CO), Mr. Stephen Bobby, by email at steven.bobby@faa.gov.  Please provide Company Name, The First and Last Name for the company point of contact, Address, City, State, Zip, Email Address, and Phone Number.   The CO will then email the Offeror a website address  log-on name, and password information.  See Supplier Training Manual Section L Attachment IV. The date and time for receipt of electronic responses is 3:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, June 30, 2006 with signed paper submittal received July 3, 2006.  Any responses submitted after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined unacceptable; therefore, not considered as one of the qualified companies.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary. ABSTRACT: Office Equipment Screening Information Request (SIR) - cont'd. The FAA will accept questions regarding this SIR within five business days of the release of the SIR on the FAA Contract Opportunities website.

<DESC>CLARIFICATION TO TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: 
1)  Question:  What does "manual control" of the model positioning system mean?  Is this an engage / disengage hand crank?  Or, is it a hand-operated toggle switch to run the position motors?
    Answer:    Manual, motorized control means by switch, knob (potentiometer or
other) or any other electrical device for motor actuation to precisely position the model. Hand cranks with a reasonable gearing, minimal torque, etc. would also be considered.

2)  Question:  What is the required "roll" range?
    Answer:    +/- 90 degrees will be adequate.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 22 Jun 06,posted 1715.  Announcement is amended to include a question/answer regarding the solicitation.  QUESTION: The request did not specify the package design required or preferred. I also need to ask if you can accept a tolerance on the wavelength of 935nm requested. Can it be +/- 10nm or what can you accept?"      ANSWER:  We require operation of the wavelength to be centered at 935nm (a spectral width of less than 6 nm is desired).  If the package can be temperature controlled to reliably operate at 935 nm, it is satisfactory.  It is not totally clear what is meant by wavelength tolerance.  If +/- 10 nm wavelength tolerance signifies that the package will operate at 935 +/- 10 nm depending on the temperature, it is acceptable as long as we can reliably temperature control it to be centered at 935 nm.

<SUBJECT>A -- Clinical Trial Methods in Neurology
<SOLNBR>NIH-NINDS-06-03
<RESPDATE>081806
<ARCHDATE>09022006
<CONTACT>Laurie Leonard, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email ll44s@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing a contract to develop a course of intensive training in clinical trial methodology for neurology research.   NINDS is attempting to identify sources with experience and expertise to develop and coordinate the scientific design and implementation of such training.  

The field of neurology clinical trials is still fairly young; unlike in oncology and other disciplines, there is no highly developed standard for clinical trial methodology, especially with respect to pilot or early phase trials. Good design and conduct of clinical trials can provide the necessary knowledge for the generation of definitive answers about the effectiveness of new therapeutic approaches.  In contrast, poorly designed or administered trials may provide misleading results, subject patients to unnecessary risk, waste considerable resources, and potentially diminish the interest of the research community and the public in the clinical trials enterprise.   The need for more medically-trained researchers with appropriate methodological training has been identified as an important limiting factor in the scope and quality of clinical research overall and specifically in neurology.

The purpose of the “Clinical Trial Methods in Neurology” course is to increase the reliability and effectiveness of clinical trials by: introducing clinical fellows and junior faculty in any neurology or neurosurgical subspecialty to the principles of good clinical trial design; exposing early career clinical scientists to the full spectrum of challenges in clinical research; and developing a cadre of well-trained, experienced clinical researchers whose expertise will foster better clinical trials design and thereby hasten the introduction of improved regimens for therapy and prevention of neurological disorders into everyday medical practice and patient care.

It is anticipated that this annual course will yield a group of talented, dedicated neurology researchers who will consequently be in a position to obtain funding for their own high quality clinical research.  If the program is successful, it is anticipated that students will return to their academic departments where they will take a prominent role in advancing local research priorities in neurology.  To achieve this objective, NINDS requires a high-impact program for training future researchers that is innovative and that exceeds all other training experiences available to those treating neurological disease.  Currently, more than half of the NINDS extramural clinical trials budget is spent on early phase (phase I, II and pilot) trials.  However, the majority of trials supported through the NINDS pilot study program have not made use of the full range of available trial designs and thus have not been as effective as possible in leading to high-impact definitive clinical trials.  Thus, the primary focus of this solicitation will be on developing researchers with expertise in early phase clinical trials.

Specific goals of the contract are as follows:  (1)  to develop scientific content, curriculum, and format of a comprehensive, hands-on training program incorporating innovative methods of teaching and conducting clinical trial research and taking advantage of knowledge gained in disciplines outside of neurology, with emphasis on early phase/pilot trials;  (2)  to organize and conduct the training program, including recruitment and selection of faculty and participants;  (3)  to conduct formal evaluation of the training program and, where relevant, incorporate results into subsequent course offerings.  Specific requirements of the contract are: (1) develop course content; (2) organize and offer course; (3) recruit course participants; (4) conduct evaluation of training program; and (5) plan, organize, and conduct subsequent training course sessions.

It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement type contract will be made for a period of five years in February 2007.  This is not a request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-06-03 will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbisopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address: (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to number note 26. ***

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to modify the response date for the synopsis from August 15, 2006 to July 28, 2006 in accordance with Note 22 for publishing a synopsis for 45 Days meaning "Calendar Days".

The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) intends to issue an order under other than full and open competition to Hummingbird Ltd., 1 Sparks Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M2H 2W1, Canada, for the purchase of Hummingbird Platinum level Technical Support.  

The Period of Performance of the order will be comprised of the Base Year October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007, and four subsequent option years.  Platinum level support supplements GAO’s installed base of Hummingbird DM and RM client software, of which GAO owns and maintains 4,000 seats.  Platinum Support includes services over and above standard maintenance, such as a dedicated Technical Account Manager, 24x7 technical support access, site visits, multiple program staff contacts, and guaranteed response times for technical support questions. Since GAO deploys Hummingbird DM/RM software on the enterprise level, having timely and dedicated technical support is warranted to ensure operational issues or support requirements are resolved in a timely manner transparent to the end-user.   

Further detail on Hummingbird’s Technical Support programs and Platinum Support may be found at www.hummingbird.com.  Hummingbird, the manufacturer of Hummingbird DM and RM software, is the sole provider of this Platinum Support.  There are no other companies known to provide similar services.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.    Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within Forty-Five (45)days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22.    END

<DESC>Reference No:  P-3 A-76 RFI Det 4, Moron AB, Spain

17.  This is a Request For Information (RFI) Only.  Air Force Space Command has started the preliminary planning process (P3) required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and the 1 Nov 05 USAF Commercial Activities A-76 Preliminary Planning Guidebook for the Det 4, Moron AB, Moron, Spain, Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep-Space Surveillance System (GEODSS).  As part of P3, the team conducts preliminary market research to determine the existence of viable commercial source(s) capable of providing the necessary services and to determine the appropriate groupings of activities as business units.  (Extensive market research necessary to support acquisition strategy decisions may/will be conducted if a streamlined or standard competition is announced in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.)  Detachment 4, of the 21st Operations Group, provides optical surveillance for the space surveillance network and is located within government facilities at Moron Air Base, Spain. The scope of operations follows:

To detect, track, identify all man-made objects in space; provide satellite tracking and Space Object Identification (SOI) data to support catalog maintenance of deep-space satellites and priority United States (U.S) space programs; search for space objects beginning at the top of the earth’s atmosphere extending beyond the geosynchronous orbit using government–furnished mission systems in accordance with USSTRATCOM Directive 505-1, Volumes I and II.  The objects may include rocket bodies, payloads, debris, and unknown items.  Specialized knowledge is necessary to perform space control operations to include an understanding of orbital mechanics and the Space Surveillance Network (SSN).

The system maintenance consists of organizational/user-level maintenance to include:  (a) fault isolation and troubleshooting through the use of built-in test equipment and diagnostic procedures;  (b) restoration of prime mission equipment, generally limited to removal and replacement of faulty components, such as assemblies or subassemblies; (c) inspection, servicing, alignment, and lubrication; (d) preventative (scheduled) maintenance and testing; (e) corrosion control, and (f) accomplishment of organizational level Time Compliance Technical Orders.

The Moron Optical Space Surveillance System (MOSS) consists of a windowed 56cm (22 inch) f/2.3 modified Ritchy-Chretien telescope mounted on a light-weight azimuth/elevation NIKE-AJAX mount.  The telescope is equipped with an up-to-date frame transfer Charge Coupled Device camera.  The operational structure consists of four (4) operator consoles, five (5) control computers, a data processor, image processor, camera processor, and a communications processor using a Red Hat Enterprise LINUX AS v3 based operating system.

All services are required 24 hours per day/seven days per week.  Service provider employees must be U.S. citizens with at least a secret security clearance.                      




This RFI is published under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 517910 with an associated Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $12.5 million. The 517910 NAICS code best describes the mission system support and Satellite tracking requirement.  If as a result of the P3 Competitive Sourcing Decision Package a “GO” decision is identified, the decision will be synopsized and posted to Fed Biz Ops.  In an effort to provide prospective offerors current and relevant information to assist them in making informed business decisions and manage their resources in the most effective way possible, the following is provided:   Det 4, Moron AB, Spain, is currently an Un-priced Contract Line Item (CLIN) on the existing Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep-Space Surveillance System (GEODSS) contract F05604-03-C-0007, awarded 01 Oct 03 with a base year and four Option Years.  The GEODSS contract is currently in the third of five years total.  The GEODSS contract optical sites are located at Socorro NM, Diego Garcia BIOT, and Maui HI.  The 21st Contracting Squadron and Program Management Offices have initiated the re-acquisition process to insure a new GEODSS contract is ready for performance commencement on 1 Oct 2008.  Performance on the existing GEODSS contract will conclude on 30 Sep 08.  If the P-3 process results in a “GO” decision and the A-76 study results in contract award, the Det 4, Moron, Spain, Operations, Maintenance and Logistical Support (OM&S) would have a performance period of two years or less to align the work as a GEODSS Contract Line Item on the GEODSS re-acquisition solicitation.  Please note:  this RFI is not for the re-acquisition of the current GEODSS contract.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This is not a request for proposal, but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICTATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT  NOTICE  to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) that can provide computer software services to support the CMS Standard Front End (SFE).  The SFE is an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) processing system which will be used by approximately 115 thousand EDI trading partners (direct submitting Medicare providers, vendors, and clearinghouses) for exchanging inbound and outbound electronic transactions.  It is anticipated that approximately 3 billion transactions a year will be exchanged with the SFE.  The SFE will receive, translate and validate inbound and outbound transactions. The SFE system will be operated by the CMS Enterprise Data Center (EDC) Contractor.  The SFE CONTRACTOR will provide maintenance to the software and coordinate testing with the Single Testing Contractor (STC) which CMS uses to execute test case specifications for each software release of the shared systems and Common Working File (CWF).  

The SFE will be implemented as part of the Cycle 1 Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) implementation.  The goal of the SFE is to provide for consistency within the Medicare environment under contracting reform beginning with Cycle 1. A future effort will determine how the front end will be integrated in the CMS end-state Architecture environment. 

Medicare currently serves over 40 million beneficiaries and processes more than 1 billion claims per year. The SFE CONTRACTOR must be capable of interfacing with the Medicare shared systems for Part A (Fiscal Intermediary Shared System (FISS), Part B (Multi Carrier System (MCS) and ViPS, the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), as well as every Medicare EDI trading partner.  

The SFE CONTRACTOR will implement the system requirements for the SFE system based on the statement of work requirements.   The SFE CONTRACTOR will use, modify or interface with existing systems to meet the functional requirements. Once tested, the SFE will operate within the EDC. 

It is expected that the SFE will be based on an existing contractor operation. Complete code testing will be performed by the SFE CONTRACTOR site until the software can be delivered to the Single Testing Contractor (STC) for final testing.  The STC will conduct unit and integration testing on the system to evaluate the system’s compliance with its specified requirements.  The SFE CONTRACTOR will develop unit test cases that have a case-to-requirements traceability matrix.  Unit test data files will be developed at the SFE CONTRACTOR site for testing the processing of Medicare EDI transactions.  

The SFE CONTRACTOR will conduct validation testing on the complete, integrated system to evaluate the system’s compliance with its specified requirements.  A critical part of the testing is to ensure all interfaces with the shared systems are in place and transactions are routed appropriately. The SFE CONTRACTOR will demonstrate proven capability to emulate existing Medicare FFS EDI processing and demonstrate capability to process and manage 13 million inbound and outbound transactions per day with an average of 1000 transactions completed (includes translation and validation) within 10 seconds.  

The SFE CONTRACTOR will provide maintenance support for the SFE software starting after implementation and continuing through the term of the SFE contract.  The SFE CONTRACTOR will develop software enhancements based on change requests approved by CMS and the system will be managed through the SFE quarterly release schedule, in conjunction with the STC and overall FFS Change Control Board.

I.  BACKGROUND

Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia has been struggling to establish a free market economy and a democratic governance system.  Immediately after independence, Armenia plunged into a humanitarian crisis as it suffered the effects of the conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) region, which lies within Azerbaijan but is occupied by ethnic Armenians, and the subsequent blockade by Turkey.  There is currently a cease-fire but no permanent resolution to the dispute.  Armenia slowly emerged from the humanitarian crisis and has been working on establishing and strengthening the institutions necessary for a free market economy, a democratic governing system, and an adequate social safety net.  Although Armenia has made significant progress on the political, economic and social fronts, there is still much room for improvement and much need for continued international support.

The U.S. Government (USG) assistance program in the Caucasus region as a whole is of particular strategic importance to the U.S. and enjoys high visibility and considerable interest from the public and private sectors alike.  Given the diverse, politically sensitive, and rapidly growing country program, USAID/Armenia became a full-fledged mission in mid-1998, having previously been part of the regional Caucasus mission.  USAID first started its programs in Armenia in 1992, focusing on emergency assistance to the large number of vulnerable persons, including those displaced by the regions’ various conflicts.  

The current USAID program focuses increasingly on sustainable development in the governance, social, health, and economics sectors.  The portfolio of assistance activities is extensive, labor intensive, and requires close performance monitoring to ensure that it is having the desired impact.  The health portfolio works to strengthen Armenia’s health system and, ultimately, improve access to adequate and affordable health services.  Programs address areas of health system reform, pharmaceutical management, maternal, child, and reproductive health, eyecare, and women’s cancer prevention and detection. Presented below is the results framework for USAID/Armenia’s health strategic objective.


II.  Introduction 

The USAID Mission in Yerevan has program responsibility for the formulation of the
Country strategy and implementation of a program designed to create a democratic society and market economy in Armenia. The Democracy and Social Reform Office (DSRO) is currently responsible for managing over 30 activities in these program areas, with a budget of approximately $30 million annually.  The DSRO portfolio is large, complex and can be divided into four major components:

	1.  In democracy, USAID Armenia’s goal is increased participation in civic life and more open governance institutions through which to channel participation, in order to stimulate the demand side for improved governance and to hold government institutions accountable through the democratic process.

	2.  In healthcare, USAID Armenia programs focus on primary healthcare, and a well-functioning health system that increases utilization of high quality services.  These factors are critical if Armenia is to break out of the vicious cycle of poverty, poor health, and low economic growth.

	3.  In social protection, USAID Armenia’s goal is an effective and sustainable benefits system, in addition to targeted vocational training.  Together, these are necessary to meet long-term universal coverage commitments for the disabled and the elderly, as well as the short-term needs of the unemployed and the poor.

	4.  In Nagorno-Karabakh (NK), USAID provides subsistence level humanitarian assistance to victims of the NK conflict based on the needs of these victims and in response to U.S. Congressional directives.  Humanitarian aid provided since 1998 is in the areas of shelter, health, drinking and irrigation water systems, de-mining and micro-loans to selected vulnerable population of NK.

DSRO must, to varying degrees, coordinate each of these activities with a large group of multilateral donors.  These include the World Bank (WB), World Health Organization, UNICEF, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and United Nations Development Program (UNDP), among others. 

Political instability in the government and frequent changes in key counterparts complicate implementation of the DSRO portfolio.  Additionally, many key counterparts have been educated in the former Soviet system and have had limited international experience or are not up to date in their fields of specialization.  

The Health SO core team currently includes two US technical advisors and one FSN (FSN- 11). DSRO is currently recruiting for another FSN 11 Health Project Management Specialist, Funding for USAID/Armenia’s Health activities totals approximately $8 million per year.  On a day-to-day basis, the DSRO USPSC/TCN Health Advisor will be responsible for designing, managing, implementing, coordinating, and monitoring major components of the Mission’s health sector portfolio.  The Health Advisor will receive guidance from the Senior US technical advisor and will be supervised by the DSRO Director.  He/she is expected to work independently, use good judgment and make decisions regarding USAID’s health sector portfolio as specified in this scope of work (SOW).  The incumbent will have the authority to negotiate on behalf of the Mission regarding the health sector portfolio.

<SUBJECT>A -- TSUNAMI FORECAST MODEL
<SOLNBR>AB133R-05-CN-1272
<RESPDATE>063006
<ARCHDATE>07152006
<CONTACT>Sharon Kent, Contract Specialist, Phone (206) 526-6035, Fax (206) 526-6025, Email sharon.s.kent@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of intent to procure, on a sole-source basis, with the University of Puerto Rico (UPP).  The UPP is currently under contract to develop two Forecast Models for the Caribbean.  A modification to the current contract is now required for the continuation of work, to add two additional models and funding, and to extend the period of performance through July 2008. 

The NOAA Center for Tsunami Research (NCTR) at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) has been developing the NOAA Short-term Inundation Forecast (SIFT), which integrates real-time tsunami measurements acquired by the NOAA network of DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) stations with state-of-the-art tsunami numerical model simulations by the NOAA tsunami generation/propagation/inundation model known as the Method of Splitting Tsunamis (MOST) model.  The modeling is performed on a system of nested computational grids that telescope down from a relatively coarse basin-wide grid, through intermediate resolution regional grids and, finally, to the finest resolution inundation model grid that will lead to a forecast.  The fine-resolution inundation model, called a Standby Inundation Model (SIM), is nonlinear, and is run in real-time, during an actual tsunami event.  One SIM needs to be developed for each forecast site. 

It is essential that this work be performed by a group in the Caribbean that is experienced in tsunami modeling and has knowledge of the local tsunami risks and hazards.  The UPP are the only known group in the Caribbean that can perform the work.  The UPP is intimately familiar with the regional tsunami risk, and has decades of experience in the application of tsunami generation/propagation/inundation models to develop tsunami inundation maps.  The UPP has worked closely with Emergency Management and NOAA/NWS professionals on the issues of hazard mitigation and, more importantly for this work, on tsunami warning issues.  This experience adds tremendously to the value to this effort.

Statement of Work:  Prepare, and optimize, a minimum of one set of computational grids (A – outer, B – intermediate, and C – inner) every three months, for a minimum of 4 sets of computational grids.  Each Computational grid shall contain:  Set of 3 high resolution reference grids, set of 3 low resolution optimized grids, input file containing MOST run parameters for both the reference and the optimized cases, and computer animations of the tsunami events selected for grid testing.  The Technical Report shall contain:  A detailed description of the grid development, testing process and time series comparison with tide gage historical data whenever available, and time series comparison of reference versus optimized grids.

The Government intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with the UPP, as we believe this is the only source with such unique expertise, qualifications and experience to perform the work.  All interested concerns must submit documentation in writing demonstrating the capability, expertise, qualifications and experience to perform the necessary work to Sharon Kent, NOAA, WASC, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle WA by June 30, 2006.   This notice may represent the only official notice of such solicitation.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service in North Carolina is anticipating awarding Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the technical review of appraisals.  These appraisals have been or will be completed on land located throughout the state of North Carolina that may be placed under a conservation easement through the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP).  The purpose of the technical review of appraisals is to provide an opinion of the acceptability of the appraisals that provide a market value of the whole subject property before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the whole subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value minus any adjustments for excess irrigation water to arrive at the effect on value of the easement.  The technical review must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS.  The original appraisal being reviewed will have been completed in compliance with the same standards.

The review appraiser must be State Certified General Real Property Appraiser, be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued and have demonstrated competency in compliance with USPAP in conducting appraisal reviews of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.  Documentation of appraisal education courses attended such as eminent domain or conservation easements and UASFLA course and at least 40 hours of training in conducting technical reviews shall be provided by the review appraiser to the authorized official.

SOURCES SOUGHT: The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC), Miami, FL intends to award a sole source purchase order to Shedd Aquarium Society in Chicago, IL., for their Research Vessel Coral Reef II  for status and exploitation of Reef Resources on Navassa Island. Shedd Aquarium is the only known research vessel that has performed past scientific charter work in this area.  Hence they are the only purveyor which possesses local knowledge of this remote area and can therefore be most reasonably expected to support scientific work safely and effectively in this area. Objective: Include assessment of reef resource status including benthic communities, fish assemblages, single-beam acoustic mapping, and observations on fishing activities at Navassa Island.
This project involves an expedition to the remote, uninhabited Navassa Island (US territory) that requires a research vessel with the following capabilities: 1) Accommodation for ten (10) scientists. 2) Ability to support scientific diving operations for ten (10) days on station at Navassa Island without resupply, 3) Provide for transportation of scientific gear and science party to and from Miami to Navassa. 4) Crew with competence and local knowledge to undertake transit and diving operations at Navassa Island. The requirement for local knowledge is particularly important as the area is remote and under disputed international sovereignty (i.e. with Haiti). The island is uninhabited but frequented by Haitian fishers. Such remoteness represents potentially hazardous conditions. The charter is to occur on or about November 1, 2006 thru November 21, 2006. The anticipated performance period is from date of award through January 31, 2007. Deliverables: Charter vessel including captain/crew to provide for at least nine working das on station at Navassa Island (not including transit time).-transit of gear from/to Miami, FL., Transit of science participants from/to Miami, FL., accommodation and food for a party of 10 scientists, diving support for science participants including air compressor and small rescues boat (SEFSC will provide NITROX breathing gas compressor system), charter vessel and operations will be in accord with NOAAA Charter Vessel Policy. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

<SUBJECT>F -- Buffers and Subsurface Phosphorus Transport Study
<SOLNBR>NRCS-10-NC-04
<RESPDATE>061604

<DESC>The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to determine if there are parties who are capable and interested in performing the required services.  All interested parties should respond to this Notice by providing the Contracting Officer with a statement of interest and a description of their capability to perform the statement of work as described in this Notice.  Employees of the USDA-NRCS are not currently performing this service; this will be a new effort to collect and analyze data to better understand the soils and landscape factors that potentially mitigate the leaching and subsurface transport of phosphorus from agricultural fields to surface water.   This project also includes the modification of the Phosphorus Loss Assessment Tool (PLAT) software, developed by North Carolina State University, to implement the results of the data collection and analyses.  

Responses to this Notice must include, as a minimum, the following information:  (1) a statement of interest in performing this work, (2) the size of organization and number of employees who hold college degrees in soils, soil fertility, agricultural engineering, and related fields applicable to this project, (3) experience conducting studies of soils, drainage and hydrology in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, (4) experience developing and implementing studies to understand the effect of Best Management Practices (BMPs) on agricultural lands, (5) experience with and knowledge of the North Carolina Phosphorus Loss Assessment Tool software, and (6) a description of experience managing projects of similar size, scope, and technical areas.

Background

Phosphorus (P) is an essential crop nutrient, but also a potential water contaminant.  Concerns over phosphorus loss from agricultural lands led to a revised USDA nutrient management policy and standard that require a site-specific assessment of the potential for excessive phosphorus transport to surface water to be included as part of a nutrient management plan.  North Carolina State University led an interagency effort to develop a computer-based Phosphorus Loss Assessment Tool (PLAT) that utilizes scientific information to guide phosphorus management for maximum productivity while minimizing environmental impacts.  PLAT has been incorporated into the NRCS nutrient management standard in the North Carolina Field Office Technical Guide found at www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.  It has subsequently been adopted by the NC Soil and Water Conservation Commission and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources for potential permitting purposes. 

The PLAT development committee and external reviewers identified and confirmed gaps in the supporting science related to the environmental effects of current and projected organic phosphorus application, the mitigating effects of various management practices, and the scientific basis for quantifying the transport of phosphorus from terrestrial to aquatic environments.  This project will address some specific gaps in phosphorus transport science in order to revise PLAT and its supporting databases.

Project Rationale

Phosphorus found in surface waters of the State is contributed by point and non-point phosphorus sources.  Research indicates that agricultural nutrient inputs represent a significant portion of the non-point load.  Soils have a finite ability to absorb phosphorus, with limits largely influenced by specific soil properties such as texture.  Exceeding the capacity of a given soil or site to adsorb phosphorus through over-application of manure phosphorus substantially increases the risk of phosphorus transport to surface and ground waters.  PLAT assigns phosphorus threshold levels for organics, sands, silts and clays, based on soil management groups with similar soil properties.

Leaching is the primary potential transport pathway under study in this project.  When phosphorus leaches below the root zone, intensive subsurface drainage increases potential phosphorus transport to surface water.  Existing research shows that sandy soils subject to a seasonally high water table as found in the North Carolina coastal plain presents increased risk for phosphorus contamination of ground and surface waters.

Unfortunately, little is known about the potential for riparian buffers and soils to mitigate phosphorus losses through subsurface pathways.  Some studies suggest buffers could partially mitigate subsurface losses in the Coastal Plain, but little is known about factors that determine the effectiveness of buffers for subsurface pathways, or how this could be quantitatively incorporated into PLAT.

Project Objectives

The specific objectives of this proposed study are to: (1) validate that the list of NC Coastal Plain soils identified in PLAT as subject to leaching is accurate and modify as needed, (2) quantify the mitigation effects of riparian buffer practices on subsurface phosphorus loss transport under a range of diverse landscape, soil, hydrology, and other site-specific factors, and (3) incorporate the results from the analyses into the NC phosphorus loss assessment procedures.  Satisfying these objectives will allow NRCS and other agencies to (a) better educate producers on the specific processes and factors controlling phosphorus losses via subsurface phosphorus transport from the field to a surface water, (b) update or revise the list of soils that PLAT identifies as likely to leach under high surface phosphorus conditions, and (c) reduce producer workload by identifying site specific conditions that will likely mitigate the transport of subsurface phosphorus from the field to a surface water source.
    
Scope or Work

The contractor agrees to quantify the extent of phosphorus leaching and subsurface transport in soils identified in PLAT with high phosphorus leaching potential and high surface soil test phosphorus levels (> 100 mg P ha-1), quantify the mitigation effects of riparian buffer practices on subsurface phosphorus transport under a range of diverse landscape, soil, hydrology, and other site-specific factors, and update PLAT software and supporting databases to reflect soluble phosphorus transport data obtained in this proposed work. 

Deliverable 1:
	
On 40-50 field sites that meet the criteria (high soil test phosphorus and phosphorus leaching potential), soil samples will be collected along transects from mid-field through the adjacent buffer to the receiving surface water body. Although field size will determine the number of transects monitored per field, approximately 5 in-field soil cores will be collected with at least two located in the buffer. Soil cores (165 cm long) will be collected and subdivided into 15 cm increments (11 samples per core) and analyzed for pH, Mehlich-3 P, Al, and Fe and water-extractable phosphorus to establish relationships between soluble and non-soluble soil phosphorus fractions. Soil texture and organic matter will also be determined.  Completion Date:  August 2005.

Deliverable 2:	

Seasonal water table levels and directional flow will be monitored following well and piezometer installations, respectively, on 4 to 5 sites selected from the 40-50 sites surveyed above. Sampling wells are composed of PVC pipe 120 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter and will be installed to 100 cm depth. Approximately 5 sampling wells will be installed along a transect beginning 5-10 m in-field from the filed-buffer interface through the buffer with at least 2 located in the buffer.  Ground water samples will be collected monthly from wells along each transect. Groundwater pH will be measured immediately upon sampling to minimize measurement error introduced as samples are exposed to CO2.  Samples will be treated with HCl to prevent microbial growth and later filtered and analyzed for soluble phosphorus. Completion Date:  December, 2006.

Deliverable 3:

Data collected from Deliverables 1 and 2 will be analyzed to determine the extent of phosphorus leaching and subsurface phosphorus transport and the influence of vegetative buffers on reducing phosphorus transport to surface waters. Based on the analytical results, PLAT and its supporting databases will be revised to reflect the new phosphorus transport information.  In order to ensure a defensible scientific foundation for PLAT and its use, the results of the project will be published in the scientific literature.  Completion date: December 2006.

This Notice solicits responses that include, but are not limited to, the following information:  (1) Size of organization and number of employees who hold college degrees in wildlife biology, wildlife management, or forestry, (2) number of employees who are Certified Wildlife Biologists by The Wildlife Society, (3) number of employees who meet the criteria to be certified as USDA Technical Service Providers under the categories “Wildlife and Fisheries” or “Wildlife and Fisheries – Interdisciplinary Biological”, (4) number of employees who hold a Certified Burner designation by the NC Division of Forest Resources, (5) a description of experience managing projects of state-wide scope and complexity, (6) experience developing upland and wetland wildlife habitat management plans on agricultural lands, (7) experience developing technical tools or procedures for wildlife habitat assessments, (8) experience training others in wildlife habitat management assessment and practices, (9) experience with wildlife habitat management in all three physiographic regions of North Carolina, (10) knowledge and experience applying wildlife-related practices using practice standards from Section IV of the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/), (11) experience conducting effective wildlife conservation outreach and educational programs, and (12) knowledge of USDA Farm Bill cost-share programs and North Carolina’s Cooperative Upland Habitat Restorations and Enhancement (CURE) program.

Background

Under the provisions of Public Law 74-46, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is assigned responsibility to assist owners and operators with the development and implementation of conservation plans and systems.  The Food Security Act and the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act (Farm Bill) authorize NRCS to utilize Farm Bill conservation program funds to deliver technical and financial assistance for wildlife habitat conservation.

A North Carolina funded effort, the Cooperative Upland Habitat Restorations and Enhancement (CURE) program, has very similar goals of delivering technical and financial assistance for wildlife habitat conservation on private lands.  

Since 2002, CURE and USDA Farm Bill programs have been implemented in a cooperative manner to leverage benefits to wildlife habitat.  This has been accomplished by focusing resources in common areas, sharing wildlife technical assistance from the respective agencies to ensure coordinated delivery of practice assistance, and using the programs’ niches and authorities in a complementary fashion to deliver single integrated wildlife habitat plans for landowners.  This cooperative approach has benefits for the client (a better product and service), the agencies (greater environmental outcomes), and the taxpayer (cost efficiencies).  Since both CURE and the USDA Farm Bill conservation programs share common wildlife objectives, it is the intention of NRCS in North Carolina to continue this cooperative relationship to the greatest extent possible.

Project Objective

The objectives of this project are:

1.  To improve the timeliness of technical assistance for North Carolina land managers who want to receive assistance from the Farm Bill conservation programs and CURE by increasing the level of technical assistance available to support the design, implementation, check-out, and reporting of wildlife-related conservation practices.
2.  To improve the quality of wildlife technical assistance available for North Carolina land managers through the enhancement of wildlife conservation planning technology and outreach tools.
3.  To improve the environmental outcomes from Farm Bill conservation programs by improving the technical quality of wildlife ranking criteria, and evaluating the conservation effects on wildlife habitat and populations.

Implementation of this project will not preclude a Farm Bill program participant from selecting and acquiring technical assistance from any Technical Service Provider certified on the USDA TechReg website (techreg.usda.gov). 
Scope of Work

The contractor is required to:

Deliverable 1: Design wildlife habitat management practices, including the development of detailed practice specifications per NRCS standards (estimate: 6,000 acres per year)

Deliverable 2: Provide technical assistance to support the installation wildlife habitat management practices cost-shared through the Farm Bill.  (Estimate 6,000 acres per year)

Deliverable 3: Provide the technical assistance for checkout, monitoring, and reporting progress of completed wildlife habitat management practices.  This includes verification that practices are applied according to plans and specifications, and reporting progress using NRCS software.

Deliverable 4: Develop wildlife management technical tools and information products e.g., technical notes, practice standards, job sheets for planners, application ranking criteria, etc. (Estimate: 12 per year)

Deliverable 5: Prepare conservation plans for program participants using NRCS planning software.  Includes providing inventory and assessment of wildlife conservation objectives and analysis of natural resource conservation treatment alternatives (Estimate: 30 plans)

Deliverable 6: Prepare and deliver wildlife management training programs for NRCS and other technical service providers. (Estimate 6 programs per year)

Deliverable 7: Prepare and deliver wildlife management outreach products and programs for potential program participants (Estimate: 6 programs per year)

Deliverable 8: Provide assistance in the evaluation of Farm Bill conservation programs effects on wildlife habitat and populations.

Quality Assurance

Technical assistance provided will be spot-checked by USDA-NRCS technical staff to ensure compliance with NRCS planning policies and adherence to Field Office Technical Guide standards (www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/).

Deliverable Schedule

Technical assistance will be made available on a continuous basis to support cost-share program applications.  Individual project assignments will be made by NRCS.  The actual extent will vary depending upon program applications within a program application sign-up period.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement to procure a LC/MS/MS Spectrometer.  This action is being pursued as a competitive small business procurement.  The intent of this sources sought notice is to determine if any small business(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFP) is available.  The NAICS Code 334516 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees. The following specifications describe a triple quadruple LC/MS/MS that is suitable for our needs.  LC/MS/MS System Specifications:  1.) The vendor must supply a bench-top triple quadruple LC/MS/MS system that includes both the ESI and APCI interfaces.  The system will be controlled by software that controls automated sample introduction, HPLC and MS/MS parameters and post-run data analysis.  The system will be supplied with an external syringe pump that can be actuated by the system software. The system will include a color laser-jet printer capable of printing 8 pages-per-minute in color.  The LC/MS/MS system and computer must fit on 15 ft of bench top including syringe pump, computer and printer, but excluding roughing pumps.   2.)  The LC must be equipped with a built-in controller, as opposed to an external controller, capable of controlling temperature over the range of 10 oC below ambient to 60 oC or higher. 3.)  The LC autosampler must have a tray for 50 or more samples, preferably closer to 100, and must be temperature controlled from 10 oC below ambient to 40 oC or higher.  4.) The LC system will be delivered with two Hypersil Gold columns, 15cm x 3mm x 3?m particle size.  5.) The MS must detect a masses of 2800 m/z or higher.  6.) The MS must have a dynamic range up to 106 counts per second.  7.) The MS scan speed must be at least 2000 (m/z)/sec.  8.) The mass-axis stability must be at least 0.1 amu/8 hours.  9.) The MS must have autotune programs for ESI and APCI.  10.) Preferably, the system can automatically create an SRM method from the scan data file of an injected standard.  11.) The data system automatically tunes the instrument.   12.) A macro language is provided to customize the software for the laboratory?s needs. 13.) The data system can accept comma-separated-variable files to create an injection sequence.  14.) The data system allows the user to create a comma-separated-variable file with specified fields.  15.)  The instrument should detect 1 pg of perfluorinated octanoic (PFOA) acid at S/N > 50.  16.) Because perfluorinated carboxylic acids are the primary anticipated analytes the system must have the lowest attainable background contamination of perfluorinated chemicals.  Commonly, sample and/or eluent exposure to Teflon-coated surfaces has been observed to affect LC/MS/MS background levels of these chemicals. If the vendor modifies pre-existing commercial LC/MS/MS systems in an attempt to lower background levels of perfluorinated chemicals, such modifications including description, cost and part numbers of replaced items, must be described in the proposal documents.   17.) We will consider as assets optional capabilities such as the ability to concentrate ion fragments in the third quad, accurate-mass capability or fast elution times that yield narrow, well defined chromatographic peaks.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirement may submit their specifications with a written qualification statement no later than 10 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to John Southerland Jr, Contract Specialist, at email: southerland.john@epa.gov.

STATEMENT OF WORK

SALT LAKE TECHNICAL LABORATORY




 
I.	INTRODUCTION


The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), Directorate of Science, Technology & Medicine (DSTM), Salt Lake Technical Center (SLTC) is requiring service and materials for pre-weight filters.

II.	BACKGROUND

The Department of Labor (DOL), OSHA, SLTC, Industrial Hygiene Chemistry (IHC) Division annually analyzes tens of thousands of samples submitted by Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs) evaluating worker exposure to regulated chemicals in workplaces all over the United State and the territories of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and Guam.  Analytical results provided by SLTC to CSHOs are often used as the basis for citations and these results must be accurate, precise, and defendable in court proceedings.

A significant number of samples (approximately 6,000 per year) are for worker exposure assessments to dusts (including silica and metals).  These dust samples are collected on filters and exposure results are based on weighing the filter before and after sampling – the weight difference determines the mass of dust collected on the sample (gravimetric analysis).  Because of the quantity of gravimetric analyses performed, SLTC has invested in high-tech robotics to process the pre- and post-weighing of filters.  Although this automated technology increases the efficiency, accuracy, and precision of gravimetric analysis, it requires the use of specific, robotic compatible, filter capsules.  

In addition to specialized analytical equipment and supplies, the actual assembly of the sampling device (fitting and sealing the filter capsule into a plastic cassette) also requires trained staff, specialized equipment, and quality control practices to test and ensure the integrity of each individual device.  SLTC has determined that the most efficient way to accomplish this work is to contract with a private business to perform the sampling device assembly.  Historically, the cost of the filter capsule is included in the assembly cost.

As part of the on-going analytical services provided by SLTC, gravimetric sampling devices are provided at any time to CSHOs upon request and submitted samples are analyzed within 15 days of when they are received.  Because the shelf-life for the assembled sampling devices are essentially indefinite, they can be annually stockpiled and maintained in SLTC’s inventory.  Maintaining an annual inventory also allows for quickly providing sample media to large scale events such as this year’s hurricane assistance efforts.  Therefore, SLTC must maintain an adequate inventory of sampling media at all times.






III.	TECHNICAL SERVICES REQUIRED

A.	Scope of Work

In coordination with SLTC analytical staff, this contract requires:

-	Robotics compatible filter capsules be assembled and delivered to SLTC.
-	SLTC staff will pre-weigh the filter capsules and return approximately 90% back to the contractor (the other 10% will be retained for internal quality control).
-	The contractor will perform final assembly into acceptable sampling devices.
-	The contractor will returne the assembled devices to SLTC. 

SLTC currently operates two Zymark Corporation robots: a model USD-1 and a model USD-4.  Further, Zymark designed and built a custom arm to manipulate gravimetric filter capsules.  SLTC currently uses a custom filter capsule (MSA Corporation’s part number 10012901) comprised of an aluminum over-guard, PVC filter, and stainless steel filter support.

Once filter capsules are received by SLTC, on a time permits basis between routine duties, analysts at SLTC prepare and load the automated system with filter capsules for pre-weighing.  Therefore, it is difficult to establish a time-line for SLTC analysts to complete the pre-weighing and return of the filter capsules to the contractor for final assembly into sampling devices.  

To accommodate both parties, SLTC and the contractor will coordinate the supply of un-weighed filter capsules in agreed to lot sizes.  As filter capsules are pre-weighed and accumulated at SLTC, minimum lots of 400 pre-weighed filter capsules will be returned to the contractor for final assembly.

An outline of the scope of work follows the sequence below:

1.	Robotics compatible filter capsules will be delivered to SLTC on an agreed to schedule.
2.	As time permits, SLTC staff will condition, pre-weigh, and give a unique bar-code for tracking to each filter capsule.
3.	As they are accumulated, lots of not less than 400 pre-weighed filter capsules will periodically be returned to the contractor for proper assembly.
4.	90% of supplied filter capsules will be returned to the contractor for final assembly.
5.	Final assembly will include, installation of filter capsules into cassettes, quality assurance inspection, and testing to ensure acceptable performance.
6.	Fully assembled sampling devices will be sent back to SLTC in their submitted lots.
7.	The contractor will maintain and report inventory data with each shipment including lost, damaged, or destroyed sampling devices.


B.	Deliverables and Schedule

SLTC is requesting a contract to provide quality assured assembly of robotic compatible sample devices including filter capsules and cassettes.  
The Contractor will be responsible for providing materials and services according to the schedule outlined below:
1.	As outlined in the Delivery Order (Task Order), the contractor will provide the first batch of SLTC robotics compatible filter capsules comprised of a compatible over-guard, filter, and filter support.
2.	Filters will be of 35 mm diameter, 5 um pore-size, low-ash PVC material compatible with OSHA analytical methods
3.	The filter capsule will be comprised of an aluminum overguard, a filter described in B.2 above, and a stainless steel “spider” support.  The filter capsule will be compatible with existing SLTC robotics.  
4.	Within three weeks of a request by SLTC, the contractor will be able to provide additional filter capsules in quantities agreed to at the time of request.  
5.	SLTC will robotically condition and weigh the filter capsules, assign individual barcodes, and return 90% filter capsules to the contractor for final assembly (the remaining 10% will be used for internal quality control programs at SLTC).
6.	SLTC will return pre-weighed, barcoded, and logged filter capsules to the contractor as they are processed in lots of not less than 400.
7.	Within one week of receipt, the contractor will:
a.	Assemble the filters capsules into appropriate plastic cassettes,
b.	Visually inspect each assembled sampling device for quality including: cracked cassettes; ripped, folded or improperly seated filter capsules; and improperly taped cassette seals.
c.	Perform a negative pressure integrity test to assure that each collection device is properly assembled, seated, and sealed, and
d.	Return the assembled sampling devices to SLTC.
e.	The contractor will include in the shipment an bar-coded inventory accounting for all filter capsules including those damaged, destroyed, or rejected by quality control for some other reason.
8.	Shipments will be by common carrier.

<DESC>I.	INTRODUCTION

Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), Management & Operating Contractor of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), is requesting an expression of interest from prospective candidates (teams, consortiums, join ventures, etc.) to provide pre-conceptual engineering services for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) prototype that produces process heat, hydrogen and electricity.  This expression of interest shall serve as a method of screening potential candidates, targeting qualified entities to receive a formal Request for Proposal (RFP). Participation in the pre-conceptual design activities described herein neither pre-qualifies nor dis-qualifies the prospective vendor for later design work for NGNP.


II.	PURPOSES

The purpose of this request for expression of interest includes identifying commercial energy industry entities interested in participating in the development and design of the NGNP prototype. The qualified responders will receive a formal Request for Proposal for the scope of work summarized herein.  

The purposes of initiating the pre-conceptual design work described herein include:

•	Assisting in focusing the technical scope and priorities of research & development activities for the NGNP.

•	Providing a basis for subsequent development of the technical and functional specifications for the prototype facilities for NGNP. 

This request for expression of interest (and subsequent RFP) is consistent with the Phase I scope of work defined for the NGNP Project in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  Phase I will define the initial design parameters for the NGNP, select the principal hydrogen production technology, and conduct supporting research and development.  

III.	BACKGROUND

The Department of Energy has selected the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) as the lead national laboratory for nuclear energy research. Per the terms of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Title VI, Subtitle C, Section 662, INL, under the direction of the DOE, will lead the development of the NGNP by integrating, conducting, and coordinating all necessary research & development activities and by organizing project participants. INL will be responsible for conducting site and project related procurements and coordinating project efforts with industry and the international community.

There is a national strategic need to promote further reliance on safe, clean, economical nuclear energy. In the 2003 State of the Union Address, President Bush launched a new National Hydrogen Fuel Initiative to provide domestically produced clean-burning hydrogen to the transportation sector as an alternative to imported oil. The combination of these two objectives, to promote nuclear energy and to produce clean-burning hydrogen, can be met simultaneously with the development of new advanced reactor and hydrogen generation technology. The Department’s mission need is to develop this combined technology that will enable the continued use of secure, domestic nuclear energy, and establish a greenhouse-gas-free technology for the production of hydrogen, thereby supporting both the President’s agenda for a hydrogen economy and the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE’s) strategic goal to promote a diverse supply of energy. 
 
IV.	GENERAL DESIGN SERVICES NEEDED

The INL is seeking to select Engineering Services for pre-conceptual design work to focus and prioritize research & development work, and in preparation for Conceptual Design on the NGNP.  The pre-conceptual design work will include evaluation of a range of design parameters and alternatives, and based on the justification for the parameters and alternatives so-developed, prepare a pre-conceptual design for the NGNP prototype facilities. The design parameters and alternatives to be evaluated will include thermal power level, reactor outlet and inlet temperatures, primary and secondary system pressures, reactor design (e.g., pebble bed compared to prismatic block), power conversion concept (e.g., direct compared to indirect cycle, power conversion machinery concept), process heat transfer and transport concepts (e.g., intermediate heat exchanger concepts, heat transport media), and hydrogen production capability. An important purpose of the evaluation of parameters and alternatives is to determine the most appropriate configuration of  the prototype to enable subsequent commercialization of NGNP technologies (e.g., scaling and licensing considerations).  Research & development needs deemed necessary to select such parameters and alternatives will be identified.

The subcontractor shall conduct concept design studies as described above to define the commercial scale prototype reactor, electrical power generation system, process heat transfer and transport systems, and the hydrogen generation plant for the NGNP using very high temperature reactor technology. The subcontractor shall also provide input regarding the appropriate overall licensing strategy that should be followed for the NGNP prototype.

The pre-conceptual design shall establish the basic reactor geometry and layout; perform reactor physics, thermal fluids studies, and heat balance and emissions calculations; provide subsystem identification and relative sizing (heat exchangers, pumps, compressors, piping, structural, etc.) including balance of plant support facilities; provide general site layout, subsystem/plant interfaces, etc. The modular reactor design shall be based on a single module capacity. The optimal size and design temperature for the reactor type shall be determined for a “commercial scale prototype reactor” for electrical power generation and optimal hydrogen production efficiencies and other industry applications of high temperature process heat. The smallest practical hydrogen plant to demonstrate production as a commercial prototype shall be recommended.  The nuclear system concept designs shall include concept design layout for the optimal sized hydrogen production plant for commercial scale demonstration for the NGNP and shall specifically address separation distance required if any, between the nuclear plant and the hydrogen plant, based on safety and licensing requirements. The overall nuclear system design work shall assemble current research & development, design information and information status (what is known and what is unknown) into a single report.

This work will include industry literature research on: current and emerging technologies for very high temperature reactors, hydrogen and electricity production, other industry high temperature process heat applications study, the site study at the INL, capital cost estimates, operating cost estimates, life cycle cost estimates, economic analysis, and project schedule, all at a pre-conceptual design level of detail. 

Information from the concept designs will: provide a foundation to define the next level of technical and functional requirements, provide NGNP management with important information required to make decisions mandated in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, provide NGNP program management with geometric data, identification of critical Structures, Systems, and Components (SSC) and data that are needed to further direct and focus planned research and development in the areas of reactor safety and design methods, fuels, materials, and licensing.  

An RFP will be issued with work scope identified along with preliminary contract terms and conditions.  The Subcontractor(s) will be selected based on scored weighted selection criteria that may include but not be limited to: technical and administrative capabilities, experience and qualifications of key management and engineering personnel of the Subcontractors proposed team, related work experience and references, rates and fees, ability to staff the work, resources,  extent and limits of cost share proposals (proprietary proposals/agreements, value-in-kind, e.g., existing applicable studies, designs or concepts, etc.) and similar other criteria.


V.	SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS

Candidates shall provide brief statements of qualifications in the following areas:

1)	A description of current knowledge or capabilities related to Pebble Bed and Prismatic reactor system design, Hydrogen plant design and balance of plant design.

2)	Demonstrated ability to integrate specialty disciplines and industry expertise to provide for an integrated pre-conceptual design for a concept reactor(s), power generation and hydrogen production plant. Specialties shall include but not be limited to reactor design, Brayton cycle turbomachinery, controls, hydrogen production, and balance of plant engineering and design.

3)	The vendor must also be able to effectively identify and evaluate technology development status and needs. 

4)	A minimum of three references who represent a direct client of your (lead) firm that can validate past history regarding reactor engineering and design services, ability to assemble and integrate highly specialized design elements and performance satisfaction. 

5)	An indication of whether the firm possesses the capability to design a commercial scale prototype NGNP modular reactor, including examples of past design efforts. 

6)	A statement to describe candidate’s Quality Program Plan with a discussion on how it is or could be “qualified” to ASME NQA-1, 2000, requirements for engineering design services.  

Failure to provide the requisite submittals may result in the candidate being determined ineligible for receipt of a formal RFP.

Again, it is the intent of this expression of interest to only solicit formal proposals (through the RFP process) from candidate firms who can and will provide all submittal requirements identified within this EOI and to those firms who, through the evaluation of provided submittals, indicate that they possess the resources and capabilities to successfully perform the required tasks.

Please provide your expression of interest to the undersigned by Close-of-Business, July 14, 2006.  If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Robert T. Crowton on Extension (208) 526-7746 or email robert.crowton@inl.gov.  Technical questions must be submitted in writing (U.S. Mail or email).

<DESC>See note 22 A requirement exists from the Program Manager for Light Tactical Vehicles, LTC Peterson, to purchase a limited number of Nomad Expert Technician Systems to eventually support PM-LTV logistics operations deployed in Southwest Asia (SWA). The limited number  of 10 each will be used CONUS and OCONUS in the Area of Responsibility. It is proposed to procure 10 each Nomad Expert Technical Systems, ND2100RBG-1, from Microvision, Inc., 19910 North Creek Parkway, Bothell, Washington 98011 to include the Mandatory Accessories and Services package (ND2000-71 and ND2000-94). The Nomad Expert Technician system will support HMMWV logistics by providing technicians and mechanics with the capability to access maintenance and supply information while at their point of task.  The Nomad Expert Technician System (ND2100RBG-1) is the w orlds only wireless wearable computer with a see-through head-worn display.  Unique ND2100RBG-1 features differentiate Nomad from all other products in the marketplace.  It is daylight and night readable so that technicians can view data at their point of  task regardless of ambient field environment lighting.   The Nomad System can only be obtained from Microvision, Inc.  Microvision is the only known source that offers such technology.  There are currently no known substitutes available for the Nomad Expert Technician System. For subcontracting opportunities, please call Gary Peterson at (425) 415-6899 or go to the www.microvision.com.

Questions concerning this request should be submitted in writing to Mr. Michael E. Hiller at the above address or by e-mail to mhiller@wmata.com. By July 17, 2006.




Background: 
      
WMATA has over 211 miles of track system comprising of at-grade subway, elevated surface tracks, 83 stations and 8 storage yards.  The subway and above ground services are almost evenly split.  The rail cars operate on five lines (Red, Green, Blue, Orange and Yellow) that run through Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia.

 The track varies in age from 30 years old to the recently constructed Green Line and Blue Line extensions.  The rail used is AREMA 115 pound rail, cant is 1:40, and nominal tangent track gage is 56 ¼".  The cars operate on 750 VDC electrified third rail. The vehicles can be controlled in two modes, manual and automatic.  Speeds can be maintained from 3 MPH up to 75 MPH.  The cars are 75 feet long, ten feet wide and operate as married pairs in consists of up to eight cars.

WMATA wants to ensure it’s rail system is operating at peak efficiency, producing the safest possible conditions as related to track defects, track geometry and third rail geometry.  These parameters will include but are not limited to gage, super elevation, curvature, surface profile, lateral alignment, defects, distance of third rail from gage face of nearest running rail, third rail height above running rail measured under full load

Objectives:
The purpose of this Request for Expressions of Interest (EOI) is to obtain feedback on the best approach for WMATA to develop and outfit a track geometry/mobile command center.  The following are the goals of the EOI:

	Determining the range of possible products or solutions available
	Confirm the technical requirements can be met
	Identifying and assessing project and procurement risks 
	Assessing potential project and procurement costs
	Identify potential vendors
	Determine project schedule



General Scope of Work:

The Authority is considering two concepts for development of a specification for the multifunction track geometry measuring vehicle:

<SUBJECT>A -- Global HIV/AIDS Vaccine Enterprise Secretariat
<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to award a sole source contract to the Global HIV/AIDS Vaccine Enterprise Secretariat for a base period of two years and subsequent option periods.   Option 1 will consist of two years and Option 3 will consist of three years.  The total estimated cost of this project will not exceed $7M.   This award will be made under Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), Unique Capabilities.  The contractor will provide services to the GHAVE Consortium:  coordinate efforts at a global level, facilitate use of common tools and technologies, and help ensure access to optimized resources. These goals will be facilitated through Enterprise Secretariat whose core functions are divided in to 3 main areas of: (A) Scientific stewardship (B) Communication and Knowledge Management and (C) Policy Analysis and Development. Scientific stewardship and communication management will be the two main areas of focus in the statement of work.   Since HIV was identified more than two decades ago 42 million people have been infected worldwide. Approximately 14,000 people are newly infected with HIV every day and if the current trend continues, it is projected that 45 million more people will be infected by 2010.  The impact of AIDS on several developing nations is enormous. There is a great loss of productivity and profitability due to decline in skilled workforce in those developing countries as well as increase in the cost of morbidity and mortality.  Along with the burden of creating a generation of orphans, AIDS has had world-wide impact on economy, political stability and social structure of those affected countries. Developing a safe and efficacious HIV vaccine that prevents HIV infection and/or transmission of HIV to others would be an enormously valuable tool for global control of the AIDS pandemic.  Despite scientists’ considerable efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine, progress has been slow mainly due to scientific challenges as well as challenges in conducting clinical trials in the developing countries, which include lack of health care system infrastructure, insufficient financial and human resources. Despite considerable efforts on the part of academia, government and private sector scientists, many of the fundamental scientific obstacles to HIV vaccine development remain.  The motivation behind the creation of the Global HIV/AIDS Vaccine Enterprise (GHAVE) was to accelerate the development of a preventive HIV Vaccine through collaborative efforts across institutions and disciplines within private industry, academia, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations in developed and developing countries to tackle these persisting obstacles.  Originally proposed by 24 leaders in the international HIV vaccine community, in an article published in June 2003 (Klausner RD, et al, Science 300:2036-2039, 2003), Enterprise was created to accomplish the following goals: (A) establish greater collaboration (B) increase resources, and (C) develop and implement a shared scientific strategic plan (SSP).   GHAVE is a virtual consortium of independent organizations committed to accelerating the development of a preventive vaccine for HIV/AIDS.  GHAVE will accomplish its mission by implementing shared strategic scientific plan and engaging the broader international community, including the G8 leaders, to support HIV vaccine research and make it an integral part of the global response to HIV/AIDS (Science 304: 1701-1856, 2004). The GHAVE Scientific Strategic Plan, the centerpiece of the Enterprise, encompasses 6 key areas of (1) Vaccine Discovery, (2) Laboratory Standardization, (3) Product Development and Manufacturing, (4) Clinical Trials Capacity, (5) Regulatory Considerations, and (6) Intellectual Property Issues.  The GHAVE Secretariat has gained international consensus and possesses the endorsement of the GHAVE Consortium which is made up of a multitude of stakeholders from the international community committed to the development of an HIV/AIDS Vaccine.  This endorsement lends credibility to the GHAVE Secretariat’s vital role in developing and updating a scientific strategic plan for the international community in order to maximize the benefits of investments made by the international community into the research and development of a vaccine.   No entity, other than the GHAVE Secretariat, has the unique capabilities that have been developed by virtue of their filling a recognized void.  The GHAVE Secretariat has received a grant from a private organization and it has been assured that funding will continue from that source in the future.   Without the direct support of NIAID and other global partners, the grant support will not be sufficient to sustain this vital resource.   In addition, the NIAID funding would have to be at least doubled to  reap the same benefit for the DAIDS/Vaccine and Prevention Research Program, and would therefore result in not only a duplication of costs but the overall costs would be greater.   Finally, as the success of GHAVE requires an internationally organized and endorsed effort, the NIAID/DAIDS, as a US Government Agency, could not by itself formulate a research agenda that would have such broad international scope and acceptance.  Therefore, no other service will satisfy Agency requirements.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting their interest and a capability statement demonstrating their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of costs and effort.  See Government-Wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<SUBJECT>D -- Two Channel Broadcast Monitoring System
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a Sole Source Firm Fixed Price contract for licesing, software and hardware maintenance of a two-channel broadcast monitoring system to BBN Technologies Corp.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)or 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1), as cited in FAR 6.302-1.  The configuration and software contained in the Broadcast Monitoring System is proprietary and a trade secret of BBN.  The BBN Technologies Two Channel Broacast Monitoring System, is currently in use by the SOJICC program.  It is not economically feasible to evaluate other brands, or to alter the current system configuration.  The monitoring system is a video data mining system that automatically transcribes the real-time audio stream and translates it into English.  Both the trascript and stranslation are searchable and synchronized to the video, so that users can easily sift through vast collections of nesw content in Arabic, Mandarin Chinese and Western Hemisphere Spanish.  As the video plays back, the system highlights spoken words in both the original language and the stanslation.

The Food and Drug Administration's requirements for registration, manufacturing, and process filing of low-acid canned foods (LACF) and acidified foods (AF) in hermetically sealed containers are codified in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 108, 113, and 114.  Process filing is required for all processing establishments in the United States and those located in other countries which process acidified or low-acid canned foods for export to the United States.

Low-acid canned food processors are required to provide the Food and Drug Administration information as to the scheduled processes including, but not limited to: processing method, type of retort or other thermal processing equipment employed, minimum initial temperature, times and temperatures of processing, sterilizing value (F0, -or other equivalent scientific evidence of process adequacy), critical control factors affecting heat penetration, and source and date of the establishment of the process, for each such LACF and acidified food in each container size; not later than 60 days after registration, and prior to the packing of a new product.

Acidified food processors are required to provide to the FDA information on the scheduled processes including, as necessary, conditions for heat processing and control of pH, salt, sugar, and preservative levels; and source and date of the establishment of the process for each acidified food in each container size.

FDA does not approve, license, or issue permits for finished food products shipped in interstate commerce. However, all commercial processors of LACF and AF, are required to register their establishments and file processing information for all products with the FDA using appropriate forms

The LACF Team conducts technical reviews of process filings submitted by industry world wide for process adequacy to ensure that hermetically sealed containers containing shelf stable foods are safe.  These process filings can be submitted either in hard copy or electronically online.  The technical review requires knowledge of various processing systems, the critical factors associated with each and an understanding of the principles of food processing to apply to new technology.  Total forms reviewed the past three years are:

2003	11,991
2004	12,984

•	Application of HACCP to LACF and AF processing;
•	FDA import procedures.  

Tasks involve conducting technical reviews of online and papers submissions and responding appropriately by either accepting the filing into the master file or returning the submission to the filer with concerns or questions to be answered.  If necessary, the contractor will generate a letter to the Project Officer detailing process adequacy concerns for a specific submission.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are not being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price type contract.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with the IN-SNEC, for a Cortex Command, Ranging and Telemetry Unit CRT XL-2, Model F261630, as it is believed that this is the only source with that can provide 100% functional compatibility and performance with the existing Cortex CRTs.  This acquisition will be processed under simplified acquisition procedures (Part 13). 

Brand Name Justification:  IN-SNEC Cortex units are THE OPERATIONAL GOES I-Q Telemetry & Command Front End Processors. The telemetry and command transmission system called the Replacement Telemetry Acquisition & Command Transmission System (RTACTS). As an integral part of this system, the Cortex unit functions as the front end processor. The Cortex is a digital signal processing (DSP) unit which can simultaneously demodulate L & S band telemetry and modulate the command data received from the RTACTS Sun E-250. It responsibilities in the GOES ground system are as follows: simultaneously demodulate the L & S telemetry received from the GOES spacecraft and format it into a usable minor frame, produce a modulated 16 KHz subcarrier which in turn is modulated onto a 74.2 MHz carrier, and incorporate the ability to range the GOES spacecraft. The design of the Cortex DSP algorithms are proprietary in nature and have been extensively tested by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ground system engineers to determine compatibility with the GOES grounds system and spacecraft. Within the RTACTS, extensive code has been developed to interact with the Cortex’s Application interface which produces full monitoring and control capability. The RTACTS system and its Cortex front end processor are currently the telemetry, command and control interface to this nation’s weather satellites. IN-SNEC’s Cortex units are currently the only front end processors that can fulfill the GOES ground system requirements without a costly redesign to the RTACTS system and possible disruption to the GOES satellites.  These units have been through extensive testing within their subsystem, RTACTS & NTACTS respectively, and are operational 24/7. The operational software in the RTACTS & NTACTS was specifically designed to communicate with IN-SNEC's interface control document (ICD) and therefore units other than those procured from from IN-SNEC are almost 100% likely not to function properly.   

1.0  SPECIFICATIONS:  Furnish and deliver one (1) Cortex Command, Ranging and Telemetry Unit CRT XL-2, Model F261630.  This model has:  No. of IF inputs:  2; Max. no. of receiver: 3; Max. no. of IF Modulator:  2; and Support of Synchronized Commanding:  Yes.  The CORTEX XL-2 supports all functions required for AMOS 3 satellites operation.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>Military Sealift Command requires the following: In support of the Information Technology deployed throughout MSC both afloat and ashore, the Command operates a 24x365 Global Helpdesk (GHD).  The current GHD software is no longer supported by the vendor and is not the Department of Navy approved helpdesk software. The Department of Navy has designated BMC Remedy as the approved trouble ticket processing software for the Navy and its components. MSC initiated a project to upgrade the current helpdesk software and deploy the software within the MCDC. In addition to the GHD, MSC also operates a Configuration Management Program to support the IT Operation, as well as a Federally mandated Asset Management Program. These activities are very tightly coupled and share much of the same data and processes. The analysis performed under the project determined that deploying a suite of BMC Remedy helpdesk software and supporting software would be the most effective and cost efficient way to meet the Governments need. The other BMC software components (Asset Management and Configuration Management) are registered with the Navy.

The system shall conform to HIPAA, JCAHO and Federal medical regulations. 

SECURITY TAGS

The ISS shall include a means of tracking individual infants. Hereafter, this means is referred to as Security Tags, no matter how the means provided actually functions: 

1.       Security tags shall provide continuous monitoring of both (1) approach to portals and (2) presence within the monitored zones.
2.       Security tags shall be effectively protected from damage via water, urine, or other substances likely to be encountered in hospital nursery. This includes any banding material used to hold the tag to the infant.
3.       Security tags shall be reusable with a required minimal reset time not to exceed 10 minutes between patient uses. The manufacturer shall provide cleaning/disinfection instructions for tags. 
4.       Sensor on security tags shall be impervious to damage from dropping from a height of at least six feet.
5.       Security tags shall be safe for use when attached to an infant's legs.

7.       Security tag strap or banding material, if used, shall be hypoallergenic, waterproof, and be pre-measured to a size appropriate for newborn infants, and premature infants; tags shall be secured enough to prevent slippage & accidental removal of bands/tags. 
8.       Security tags shall consist of not more than two loose parts, none of which shall be small enough to pose a choking hazard to infants or children. A third interface material, if necessary to conduct signals or establish contact may be used if the material adheres to the tag in such a manner as to prevent hazards to the infant (or visiting children).  
9.       Security tags shall provide automatic coded indications of failure or warnings to the computer monitoring system.
10.       Security tags shall have a means to indicate battery status or test battery charge level.     
11.       The ISS shall alarm if an attempt is made to remove the tag without deactivating in the central alarm station.

Engineering services are required for the preparation of plans, specifications, cost estimates, related studies, and all associated engineering services for the planning, design and construction of wetland restoration projects in various locations in North Carolina.  THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED and is therefore open to all businesses regardless of size.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541310, which has a size standard of $4 million in average receipts.

The Government contemplates the award of possible multiple Firm-Fixed Price; Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts resulting from this competition.  The initial contract period will be for one year and the government may, at its option, extend the contract to a maximum of five years by exercising each of the four one year renewal options.  Work under each of the contracts will  be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.  The firms selected are guaranteed a minimum of $3,000 in fees for the base year.  There is no guaranteed minimum for the option years, if exercised.  The amount awarded in fees for each year of the contract (base year and each option year, if exercised)will not exceed a maximum of $750,000.  Task Orders will be negotiated as firm fixed-price procurements for individual or clusters of conservation practices.  

Task Orders are expected to include civil, agricultural, and/or environmental engineering services and other services as needed to plan, design, and implement wetland restoration practices.  Engineering services are required to perform all phases of preliminary investigation, plan, design, and construction 
supervision of practices.  Task orders may include performance of any part or all services required to design and/or implement designated conservation/engineering practices on lands where NRCS is authorized to work under various programs.

Hinge score covers to prevent cracking and run the cover paper grain parallel to the spine dimension. Spine type shall remain centered, must be with a flexible spine and free floating cover structure.

FLIGHT TERMINATION CONTROL PANEL, COMMUNICATIONS AND ROUTING

STATEMENT OF WORK


1.0	INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this Statement of Work is to define the requirements for the services to create a control and communications system linking one or more FTS officers with the FTS transmission and verification equipment used to transmit to launch vehicles.  The system requires two major components, a control panel which collects button and switch state data and sends it to the routing computer, and a routing computer which acknowledges receipt of state information and presents it in proper form to the encoder/exciter and amplifier.  The routing computer also echoes the command state and the verification state data back to the control panel.  Communication between the two is through voice grade analog DSO channels using modem circuitry.  

2.0  REQUIREMENTS
The contractor shall perform all tasks required in the Statement of work to produce a FTS Control Panel with Power Key Switch and Carrier Key Switch and a Routing Computer including 16 modems and Ethernet switch with 7 CAT5 Ports and 1 Fiber Port.  In addition to meeting the technical requirements, the contractor is required to prepare and produce associated documentation, i.e., design reviews, TIM’s, electrical, mechanical design, and full documentation of electrical/software I/F.

2.1	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
The contractor shall provide a control panel that contains DPDT switches and two LEDs.  The programming will be firmware written in assembly language with no operating system or file system.  It is to be stored on chip in Flash EEPROM memory and executed directly out of that memory.  The FTS equipment end will consist of four redundant routing computers connected to four FTS equipment chains.  For interfacing to legacy equipment, discrete input and output signals will be handled by solid-state relays.  Outputs will be isolated contact closures or powered (non-isolated) with a voltage source.  Inputs are to isolated voltage or current loads.  For interfacing to FTS encoder/exciter, amplifier and verification receivers, each chain is connected to its own 10/100 ethernet switch.  Each routing computer will connect with two switches and pairs of switches are linked with fiber optic cabling so each router has access to all four equipment chains.  Each routing computer will contain 16 modems to allow it to communicate with up to 16 FTS control panels.

2.2	MEETINGS, REVIEW, CONFERENCES
A system design review shall be held at a mutually agreed upon time and place to review the electrical and mechanical design along with software development.

2.3  DOCUMENTATION
The contractor shall provide full documentation of the control panel mechanical, electrical design as well as software development and support integration documentation.  

NOTE:   Contractor shall provide Hourly Rates, Hours, Extended Cost, Materials, and Subtotals for Electrical Assembly, Mechanical Assembly, Quality Control, Test Technician, CAD Engineer, Program Manager, Senior Engineer, Materials – all per 5 items listed above the Statement of Work. 
Interested parties who believe they can meet all the requirements described in this synopsis are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the required equipment.  FOB Destination is the Government preferred method of shipping.  Please submit FOB Destination shipping information with all submittals to the office.  Offerors are required to submit with their quote enough information for the Government to evaluate the minimum requirements detailed in this synopsis.  
52.232-33 Mandatory information for electronic funds transfer payment.  Before we can begin the contracting process with your company, I need the following Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) completed-- http://orca.bpn.gov/.  FOR MPIN REGISTRATION: http://www.ccr.gov/mpin.asp.   Use of online representations & certifications application (ORCA) became mandatory 1 January 2005.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes, standardizes, and moves the collection and storing of FAR level representations and certifications online. Representations and certifications are to be completed at least annually by vendors on-line through the ORCA portion of the Business Partner Network (BPN).  Contractors, presently registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), can get a head start by going to www.bpn.gov/orca/ to activate their ORCA profiles.  Initially, ORCA will retain the most significant contractor representations and certifications that would apply to any acquisition in the form of 26 questions.  Solicitation-specific representations and certifications may still be used outside of ORCA.

6.0  RESPONSE DATE AND TIME:  Offers are due in the office of NOAA’s Western Region Acquisition Division, address noted above, by 2:00 PM (local time) on July 11, 2006.  Only firms that can provide the exact AquaFix 406 GPS I/O Personal EPIRB Model PLB-200 as described herein will be considered. 

7.0  Brand Name Justification:  The Personal Locator Beacons (PLB) transmits on 406 MHz via the COSPAS-SARSAT satellite system with a unique, digitally coded distress signal and transmits a 121.5 MHz SAR homing signal.  This unit has all of the following unique characteristics which other PLBs to not have: (1) The unit must be a U.S. legal PLB or “FCC approved”.  The U.S. added two notable requirements to the international PLB standards.  PLBs that are not U.S. legal cannot be registered with NOAA, (2) It must have a 406 MHz distress beacon.  A 406 MHz distress beacon is more accurate than a 121.5 MHz beacon.  Also, the 121.5 MHz beacon does not have GPS capability and satellite processing will cease in 2009, (3) It must be waterproof.  These PLBs will be used on fishing vessels in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.  Therefore, it is critical that they are designed to function in this environment, (4) It must float.  To avoid loss if it is dropped in the water.  Also, PLBs will not function if the antenna is entirely submerged, (5) It must have a GPS chip.  Adding GPS to a PLB results in a more accurate location.   It also allows instantaneous location and launch of search and rescue assets, and (6) The GPS must be both external and integrated.  An external GPS allows the operator to load location information prior to abandoning a vessel.  An integrated GPS allows the operator to acquire the GPS location from satellites after abandoning the vessel, which can take time.  It is critical that the PLB provides both options since an operator may not have time to load the location information before abandoning the vessel.

<DESC>This amendment provides responses to questions received: 


Q.  Statement of Work, III. Submittal Requirements, Part A, 1.a:  Please clarify where the 3” rough swan untreated running planks go.  Are these to placed on top of the 2” wood decking?  If so, do they cover the entire surface of the 2” wood decking?

A:  The 3 X rough sawn untreated running planks are to be placed on top of the treated timber decking for the full travel width (i.e. 5-foot width) as stated in the SOW section referenced by individual raising the question.  The fabrication plans to be provided as a deliverable to the FS by the successful bridge manufacturer will show the attachment method of the untreated timber running planks to the treated deck.  Typically this is performed using a minimum 3/8" diameter galvanized ring shank spike sized for length not greater than the combined depth of the running surface (minus any countersinking) and the bridge deck.  Further conversations will be required with the successful bridge manufacturer on pre-bored hole diameters, fastener size and installation patterns before final approval is given on these details.

Q:  Can the bridge deck be ACZA treated Doug Fir? This treatment is the norm for our steel truss bridges when decked with Doug Fir.  Side Note: Our timber bridges are typically treated with CU NAP(Copper Naphthenate).

A:  No.  Copper Naphthenate in a light oil (Type C Solvent) will be the specified preservative treatment.

Q:  What is the expected rail height(42"or 54")?  Are there to be horizontal safety rails, vertical pickets, or is the welded fencing by itself to keep people from falling through the truss?  Is there to be a handrail or is the top chord of the truss to function as a handrail?

A:  The rail height is to be 54" above the top of the travel surface of the bridge.  There are no horizontal safety rails or vertical pickets.  The WWF safety fencing will serve as the safety barrier on the steel superstructure.  The top chord of the truss shall function as the handrail in this installation.

Q:  Can our quote be submitted to you via fax or E-mail?  If not, what are the procedures required to package our quote?

A:  SOW Section III.A.2 requests three (3) hard copies of documentation to be submitted in addition to the price quotation.  Quotes may be faxed to 907-743-9492 or mailed to USDA Forest Service, Chugach NF, 3301 C Street Suite 300, Anchorage AK 99503. Quotes may also be emailed to: kweidenbaugh@fs.fed.us.  Hard copy information in the correct number of copies requested should be delivered to the address provided by  28 June 2006 at 10:00 am Alaska Time.

<DESC>Amendment 01 to N62645-06-R-2009 (Frequently Asked Questions)
Closing date remains unchanged.

1.       In the service elevator room/hallway (central triangle area), there are 2 elevators and 6 entrance ways into that area. Does NMCSD wish to secure the six normal doors with lock and key method? Or does NMCSD intend that vendor secure the elevator doors with their installed system? 

ANS: (see answer as part of question 2)

2.       In the same service elevator area, is an alarm sensor be added to cover the access to the elevators? If vendors secure the elevator doors, would the Automatic robot cleaning device that uses those elevators interact/override the door locks? 

ANS: NMCSD does not require locking the doors on the service elevators. Therefore, an alarm sensor, that shall alarm if a protected infant enters the lobby area of the service elevators, is required. Additionally, a camera is required in the area.

3.       Vendors wish to know if the distance for alarm sensors to engage door locks should be 10 feet from the doors on the inside of the wings. Is this acceptable? (If Nuisance alarms are anticipated, a Do-not-pass line could be applied to the floor at the 10-foot boundary.)

ANS: The offeror shall determine the best means and distance of providing the desired result based upon the design of their system. Nuisance alarms are a concern, therefore a means to minimize them are the responsibility of the offeror.

4.       Installers Wages: is this a Prevailing Wage Project? And if so, please send us the rates to be used.

ANS: Wage parameters are not set by this solicitation, or by the resultant contract. This is for the purchase of the ISS Equipment, the installation is incidental. Winning bidder must comply with local, state, and Federal regulations regarding wages.

5.       Please send Full Size Copy of Floor Plans for 3rd Floor Infant Area for both bidding & asbuilts.

ANS: Floor plans are available as PDF files, these drawings are only floor plans, and do not contain any of the information normally found in architectural drawings. The PDF files are available upon request by emailing rtaylor@nmlc.med.navy.mil. Only CCR registered companies will be granted access to these files.

6.       Confirm installation - Cabling above ceilings & floors can be Plenum rated, exposed areas to either be EMT Conduit or Wire Mold

ANS: The walls of the third floor are plasterboard and metal studs. Installation of wiring/conduit on the exterior of the walls is not acceptable. PLENUM rated cables are acceptable where regulations and codes permit. Wires that run down must be encased in conduit.

7.       Existing Security System: Provide the company names who installed the existing system & if there are items to be reused such as door holders, cameras, sensors, keypads etc. I wish to have model numbers / cut sheets. I wish to have Equipment Submittals, & existing asbuilts, this may help to save money on the installation for the Owner.

ANS: CEI (Construction Electronics, Inc.) and RFT (RF Technologies, Inc.) are incumbent contractors for the existing system. See answer 36 for details. Model numbers/ cut sheets are not available. All existing equipment (cameras, doors, etc.) is the property of the government and can be reused if it is in accordance with FAR 52.211-5 (e), with government approval. Materials/equipment must be of New, Reconditioned, or Remanufactured condition. 52.211-5 -- Material Requirements. http://www.arnet.gov/far/ 

8.       Confirm that where existing CPU Server on 3rd Floor, Janitors Closet, that this room can be used to mount New Security Equipment. From there vendor can use the existing LAN for communications from our new panels to New Monitor Station / Server at the 1st Floor Security Room.

ANS: Janitor closet mentioned is a wet area, it is strongly suggested that another location would be more appropriate to locate electronic components. It is recommended that the utility c tack mats at least daily (or according to manufacture’s recommendations).

Level 3 - Rigid Barrier Precautions
To Level 1 and Level 2 controls add:
A.	Erect rigid walls at entrances and exits, or create an airtight plastic barrier prior to the beginning of the construction and demolition.  Each entrance and exit must be constructed so that it has a door or double flap of plastic to prevent the escape of dust and other airborne contaminants
B.	Isolate HVAC system in area where work is being done.  Seal all vent openings before work begins to prevent contamination of the duct system.
C.	Maintain negative pressure within work site using HEPA-equipped air filtration units.
D.	Upon completion of work, vacuum work area with HEPA filtered vacuums.  Wet mop area with hospital-grade disinfectant.

<DESC>Amendment 02 to N62645-06-R-2009 (Infection Control and Dust containment policy). Closing date remains unchanged.

Infection Control Policy for
Construction and Renovation


Background

Fungal spores occur naturally in the environment, such as soil & plants.  These spores can also be found in plaster, building materials, ceiling tiles and dust.  The generation of dust during construction and maintenance activities may cause dispersal and dissemination of fungal spores.  Although usually not a problem for a healthy person, in the health care environment, these spores can cause serious illness or even death in some individuals.  For this reason it is important that correct infection control and dust control measures be followed during construction and maintenance activities.



Risk Areas

Buildings 1 through 6 are divided into high risk and low risk areas depending upon patient acuity and the patient care activities carried out.  Color-coded drawings designating high and low risk areas are available thorough Facilities Management.   Together with the Infection Control Section, Facilities Management will update the drawings at least annually.  Contractors planning construction or maintenance activities must review a copy of these drawings and provide appropriate barrier precautions for the designated areas.



Construction Project Activities

Construction project activities are grouped by invasiveness and potential for generating dust.

Type A - Inspection and non-invasive activities
Includes but is not limited to:
-	removal of ceiling tiles for visual inspection
-	painting (but not sanding)
-	wallcovering, electrical trim work, minor plumbing, and activities which do not generate dust or require cutting of walls or access to ceilings other than for visual inspection

Type B - Small scale, short duration activities that create minimal dust
Includes but is not limited to:
-	installation of telephone and computer cabling
-	access to chase spaces
-	cutting of walls or ceiling where dust mitigation can be controlled

Type C - Work that generates a moderate to high level of dust or requires demolition or removal of any fixed building components or assemblies
Includes but is not limited to:
-	sanding of walls for painting or wall covering
-	removal of floor coverings, ceiling tiles, and casework
-	new wall construction
-	minor duct work or electrical work above ceilings
-	major cabling activities
-	any activity which cannot be completed within a single work shift

Type D - Major demolition and construction projects
Includes, but is not limited to:
-	activities which require consecutive work shifts
-	requires heavy demolition or removal of a complete cabling system
-	new construction



Infection Control Precautions

Level 1 - Routine Infection Control Precautions
A.	Maintain manpower and equipment, including dust mops, wet mops, brooms, buckets and clean wiping cloths for cleaning fine dust from floors.
B.	Clean up dust tracked outside of work area immediately.
C.	Dampen surfaces, if needed, to control dust.
D.	Debris will be removed in tightly covered containers.
E.	Ceiling tiles removed for any reason will be replaced at the end of the workday.
F.	Affix temporary closures or make permanent repairs to any holes or openings in walls, ceilings or floors prior to leaving the area.

Level 2 - Localized Precautions
To Level 1 Routine Infection Control Procedures add:
A.	Arrange to reroute unnecessary traffic in the area and place signage indicating temporary route, if appropriate
B.	Use control cube for ceiling work if area cannot be vacated.  Control tube must extend from floor to ceiling and be dust tight.
C.	Seal doorways for projects that generate large amounts of dust.
D.	Seal or filter exhaust & ventilation ducts.  Where practical, increase exhaust in the area.
E.	Install tack mats at interior and exterior of all openings that allow egress from the work area.  Changeloset on 3 East, room number 3R-R3.2 be used. The ward clerk has direct line of sight on this room and it is located right next to the unit LPO's office.
