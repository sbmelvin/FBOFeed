Additionally, SSI distributes its publications to key leaders in the Army and Department of Defense, the broader military educational system, Congress, the media, other domestic and international think tanks and defense institutes, and major colleges and universities. The period of performance will be for one year beginning on the effective date of the contract at least. Offerors may submit pricing to include up to four one year option periods.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB (NCHHSTP), Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP), Lab Branch (LB) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source follow-on contract with Emory University/Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Atlanta, GA, for the continued participation in the project entitled, "<br />Evaluation of Intravaginal Rings or Other Novel Devices for Delivery of Antiretroviral Drugs and In Vivo Evaluation of Topical Microbicide with Antiretroviral Drug Combination for the Prevention of SHIV in Pigtail Macaques." The anticipated performance period is 24 months. The purpose of this project is to continue to provide pre-clinical, topical microbicide intervention study to evaluate safety and/or efficicacy of several difference microbicide products for the prevention of mucosal SHIV transmission in a repeat challenge macaque model of HIV-infection. The Contractor will continue to maintain humane treatment of the female pigtail macaques in accordance with the Animal Welfare Regulation and Human Health Services policies and to perform and evaluate the following major tasks: 1) IVR/device with and without antiretroviral drugs for the prevention of mucosal SHIV transmission in a repeat challenge macaques model of HIV-1 infection; 2) the immunologic and pharmacologic kinetics at peripheral and mucosal sites; and 3) efficacy of topical microbicide gels containing antiretroviral drugs to block SHIV infection in a repeat-exposure macaque model of HIV-1 infection and compare with orally administered drugs used as a positive intervention control. All data generated from this project is the property of CDC.
<p>Emory University/Yerkes Primate National Center&lsquo;s long-term experience with this study will help ensure the most efficient implementation of this project for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) The Contractor has worked on this project for several years and is already intimately familiar with the study, agency's requirements, and past and ongoing information on the "existing" macaques.<br />2) Past participation and continued partnership is critical for resolving ongoing resolutions and/or remediation.<br />3) Time constraints imposed by CDC for restricted testing schedules.</p>
<p>It is critical to the study to continue to collect data from the original source than to any other source which would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling CDC's requirement; therefore, a follow-on award with Emory University/Yerkes National Primate Center would be the most efficient and cost effective way to deliver services that are critical and essential to meet CDC's needs. CDC intends to negotiate this requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, HHSAR 306.302-1. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 541720 with a small business size standard of $7 million.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties who believe they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to meet this requirement. All responses should be received by November 10, 2009 at 2 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST). All responses must be in writing and can be sent via email to bbv9@cdc.gov or fax to 770-488-2868. No telephone calls will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH intends to negotiate on a non-competitive, sole source basis with the University of North Carolina, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, and University of Mississippi, the four field centers for the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study to award a follow-up study.  The cited authority is 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This effort will be a six-year follow-up of the ARIC participants and continued community surveillance for cardiovascular disease.  These contractors have been involved in the recruitment, follow-up, collection and analysis of data, and reporting of results on 15,792 participants selected from four communities in the United States.  Additionally, these contractors have been involved in the collection and review of hospital discharge records and death certificates to monitor the trends in incidence and mortality of coronary heart disease and heart failure in the four communities.  The incumbent contractors have the unique capability to provide these required services to NHLBI for the follow-up of the study.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study. The background and objectives of the study are detailed below.

Background and Purpose of the ARIC study:  ARIC is a prospective epidemiologic study conducted in four U.S. communities: Washington County, MD; Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; and Minneapolis, MN.  The study is designed to monitor the trends in incidence and mortality of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure in communities, and to investigate the etiology and natural history of subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease.  Accordingly, ARIC includes a Community Surveillance Component and Cohort Study Component.

In the community surveillance, the four communities are investigated to determine the community-wide occurrence of hospitalized myocardial infarction and CHD deaths in approximately 470,000 men and women aged 35-84 years. Starting in 2006, surveillance
of inpatient (ages 55 years and older) and outpatient heart failure (ages 65 years and older) is included for the events beginning in 2005.

In the cohort study, approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 years were recruited by probability sampling from each of the four communities under surveillance. A total of
15,792 participants (11,478 whites, 4,266 African Americans, and 48 other) received an extensive baseline examination in 1987-1989. Three repeat examinations were conducted in 1990-92, 1993-95, and 1996-98, with a response rate of 93%, 86%, and 80%, respectively. The examinations collected information on demographics, psychosocial and behavioral factors, dietary intakes, physical measurements, and biological and genetic markers. Follow-up occurs yearly by telephone to maintain contact with participants and to assess health status of the cohort. Retention rate remains to be high (92%). There were approximately 13,000 participants alive as of December 2008.

To capitalize and expand upon the resources of data, specimens, and infrastructure developed over 20 years in ARIC, this follow-up study aims to: 1) re-examine the ARIC cohort to characterize heart failure stages in the community and identify genetic and environmental factors leading to ventricular dysfunction and vascular stiffness; 2) enhance the ARIC study with cardiovascular outcomes research to assess quality and outcomes of medical care for heart failure and heart failure risk factors; 3) assess longitudinal changes in pulmonary function and identify determinants of pulmonary function decline; 4) continue cohort follow-up for outcomes measures such as CHD, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and stroke; and for the study of factors related to progression of subclinical to clinical CVD; 5) continue community surveillance to monitor long-term trends in hospitalized MI, CHD deaths, and heart failure; and 6) provide a population laboratory platform for ancillary studies in cardiovascular and other areas.  The study will serve as a valuable national resource for training young investigators. 

Each field centers expected responsibilities that will continue during the follow up phase include (but are not limited to): 1) participate in and designate staff to lead the study and participate in committees, such as the Steering Committee, Morbidity and Mortality Committee, Laboratory Committee, Outcomes Research Committee, Quality Assurance and Control Committee, Publications Committee, Operations Committee, and other subcommittees, as appropriate; 2) recruit and re-examine the local established ARIC cohort of men and women for ARIC Exam 5; 3) conduct surveillance of the cohort and community for clinical cardiovascular events; 4) provide junior investigators with experience and responsibilities for specific scientific and study management areas and data analysis and publication; 5) participate actively in data analysis, presentation, and publication; 6) work cooperatively with other study centers, including other field centers, Coordinating Center, Lab Centers, Echo Reading Center, Outcomes Research Center, and the NHLBI Project Officer staff in all relevant aspects of study development and execution; and 7) prepare and submit technical and financial reports as specified herein.
 
This notice of intent expires 15-days from its posting. This is not a request for proposals (RFP). The estimated award date is November 1, 2010. All responsible sources may submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants. Any interested parties in this or potential subcontracting opportunities may contact either Kristiane Cooper, Contracting Officer, cooperke@nhlbi.nih.gov, 301-435-0345 or Elizabeth Zoller, Contract Specialist, zollere@mail.nih.gov, 301-435-0345.

Note:  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, Rhode Island is NOT accepting quotes or proposals via submission through NECO.
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport intends to award a Sole Source, Firm Fixed Price contract to Barber-Nichols, Inc., 6325 West 55th Avenue, Arvada, CO 80002 for the following items: 2 each Air Turbine Assemblies, with an option to purchase 1 each additional Air Turbine Assembly, 6 each Clutch Kits, with an option to buy 8 each additional clutch Kits, and one lot of Spare Sub-Components, with an option to buy one lot of Stator/Rotor Tie Rod bolts. Barber-Nichols is currently producing Air Turbine Assemblies for the Mk 21 ATP which have been proven to meet all the technical requirements.  The Navy has invested considerable time and money into the design, development, testing and production of this component. Duplicating this effort for development of another source would cost the Navy in the millions which would not be recouped through competition. In fact, these non-recoverable costs significantly exceed the total estimated cost of the spare Air Turbine Assembly contract. Further, a new supplier would require additional time between contract award and delivery of the spare units to account for the efforts described above, thereby significantly impacting the mission readiness of the SEAWOLF and VIRGINIA Class submarine force. Required delivery is as follows: 2 each Air Turbine Assemblies, 1st at 92 weeks ARO, and the 2nd at 16 weeks from 1st delivery; 1 each (opt 1) Air Turbine Assembly, 92 weeks after option exercise;6 each Clutch kits, 40 weeks ARO; 8 each (opt 2) Clutch kits, 40 weeks ARO; 1 lot of Spare Sub-components, 56 weeks ARO for bearings, 40 weeks ARO for tie rods, and 30 weeks ARO for the remainder; and 1 lot (opt 3) for additional tie rods, 30 weeks ARO after option exercise. F.O.B. Destination Naval Station Newport, RI. Size Standard is 1,000. Approximate date for the issuance of the solicitation is on or about September 18, 2009.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The project will be conducted in progressive phases with the initial proof of concept program meeting the form and function requirement of target end-users and preliminary field evaluations of said equipment(s).  <BR>The Government seeks a limited quantity prototype system for proof-of-concept testing and evaluation.  The Government is interested in the understanding the technology maturity and feasibility of achieving all or part of the following requirements.  Potential bidders must address each technical and functional requirement in terms of cost, technology readiness, technical complexity, and risk.  The winning contractor will demonstrate success in iterative requirements definition, system design, hardware/software engineering, and manufacturing prototype devices.  During requirements analysis, the contractor will specify derived requirements and present to the Government for approval during weekly design reviews.  This includes innovative approaches to technologies, material, or overall system design that improve the success of this product.  The contractor will also be able to produce, based on user feedback, a build-to specification for transition to manufacturing.  The contractor will support iterative testing, acceptance testing, operational testing by providing SMEs, issue resolution, and training as required. <BR><BR>

<DESC>A.	GENERAL INFORMATION1.  Title of Project: The Genomic Informatics System for Integrative Science (GenISIS) 	2.  Scope of Work:  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in the statement of work (SOW), except as may otherwise be specified.  This SOW solicits a contractor to provide expertise to build and implement the logic, work flow and code of the GenISIS Platform using state of the art methodologies and technology.  The contracting team will transfer 100% knowledge to the VA team.  The GenISIS Platform will exist behind the VA firewall and provide functionality to:	Load, store, and associate genomic and case report form (CRF) data generated by a variety of VA research laboratories and clinical research centers.	Support researcher ad-hoc multi-dimensional queries of CRF and selected genomic information.	Support template reports to administrative and scientific stakeholders.	Create study-specific subsets of data for analysis. 	Provide an interface for remote access allowing users to run data analysis within a centralized, secure environment obviating the need to move data from the source.	Accept and incorporate processed results and associated scientific metadata from investigators to create a knowledge base available to a diversity of end users. 	Perform at acceptable levels given the magnitude of the VA enterprise.	Scale appropriately to support inclusion of additional data types (e.g., specimen data, medical record data, etc).	Meet all VA information privacy and security standards.	Implement automated processes to govern the policies of information access and usage outlined by VA Office of Research and Development (ORD).	3.  Background:  Personalized medicine and large scale genomic research are long term goals of the Veterans Health Administration and the VA ORD.  Initiatives underway in ORD include planned genome-wide scans and copy number variation in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinsons disease and post traumatic stress disorder.  As currently planned, genomic data will become available by the end of fiscal year 2009.  In the absence of new computational infrastructure and overarching policy from ORD, investigators generating these data will follow academic and industry models of data use with expectation of data storage and analysis on their own silo servers outside of the VA firewall.  This approach will generate real and perceived concerns of data security and privacy; complicate sharing of data with other VA investigators and present barriers to data standardization and ultimate integration with the VA electronic medical record (VistA).  The alternative is the creation of a platform to support the next generation of clinical science that is capable of providing secure and efficient access and analysis of genotypic data accrued in several formats (e.g., genome-wide scans, sequence, copy number variation, haplotype, etc.) and phenotypic data to VA researchers and approved academic affiliates.  This platform is referred to as the Genomic Informatics System for Integrative Science (GenISIS).  The success of this development initiative will be critical in forging the future direction of clinical science for the VA Office of Research and Development.  This Statement of Work outlines a collaborative project between a vendor and a team of VA developers.  Together they will review the current state of VA clinical and genomic research informatics and design GenISIS using state of the art methodologies and technology.   	4.  Performance Period:  The period of performance is 1 year from contract award for phase I with an option year for phase II.   Work at the government site shall not take place on Federal holidays or weekends unless directed by the Contracting Officer (CO).  5.  Type of Contract:  Firm-Fixed-Price6.  Place of Performance: A team of VA developers at the VA Boston Healthcare System will be assigned to work on this project.  The awardee of this contract will be required to provide 40% of their contracted time on station to work with this team of VA developers.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) recognizes that developing more robust and comparable measures of people's subjective well-being can play an important role for decisions aimed at improving the living and working conditions of different population groups, including elderly people. These measures hold the promise of allowing disentangling the importance of different factors (such as working conditions, health status, transport) that prevent elderly people from living in conditions of greater autonomy. They may shed light on the importance of people's appreciations of their own health (beyond objective measures of their physical functioning) on the quality of their life, and to measure some of the secondary effects of health status. Given the emphasis now given, in the United States as elsewhere, to enhancing people's physical and mental health - including feelings of well-being - rather than simply preventing mortal disease, information on subjective health and well-being can play an important role in guiding policies and delivering higher-quality services. NIA has a strong interest and investment in recent years in research on the domains of well being, and has supported research on the development of measures using various theoretical frameworks. At this juncture, it would be of great value to have an independent international group of statisticians and economists to evaluate the validity and usefulness of these domains and their instruments, and provide guidance on developing instruments or interview items for use in population or national surveys.<br />To this end, NIA looks to evaluate the current state of research and methods development for the measurement of well being, and based on the findings of this report, develop a handbook. This proposed handbook, the outcome of a joint effort of the academic and the statistical community can raise awareness on the importance of subjective well-being measures of different population groups (children, adults, elders) as well as identify the best approaches for measuring in reliable and consistent ways the various dimensions of subjective well-being. Such measures could be produced through dedicated surveys or by including suitable questions in existing surveys undertaken as part of the National Statistical System of each country.</p>
<p>Background<br /><br />Building on the workshop "Measuring Subjective Well-Being: An Opportunity for National Statistical Offices?", jointly organized with ISTAT in Florence on 23-24 July 2009), research activities (e.g. the ongoing Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development {OECD} project on "Subjective Well-Being and Social Policies", undertaken by the OECD Social Policy Division in co-operation with Prof. Andrew Clark, Paris University), and taking into account the work and public reports from the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, established by the French Presidency in early 2008 and chaired by Prof. Joseph E. Stiglitz, the OECD Statistics Directorate.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements</p>
<p>Task 1: Development of handbook for use by National Statistical Agencies.<br />Develop a study team which will hold a series of meetings and draft a handbook or manual on the use of measures of well being in the context of national statistical agencies and surveys. The handbook could consist of a report of around 100 pages, to be released in both paper and electronic forms. A number of dissemination activities (workshops, seminars) will be held in various OECD countries in mid 2011 to discuss the content and implementation of the handbook.</p>
<p><br />Subtask 2.1: Appointment of Study Panel<br />Establish a group of advisors to oversee the preparation of the handbook. This advisory group will gather a number of times over a period of 18 months. Members of this advisory group may include representatives from academia, international organizations, national statistical offices and commercial providers.</p>
<p>Subtask 2.2: Development of draft handbook<br />Advisory group members will comment on various drafts of the handbook, and provide written inputs to be used in its preparation. They will jointly share authorship for the handbook. A preliminary draft of this handbook would be discussed in the summer of 2010, and undergo final editing in mid 2011.</p>
<p>Task 3: Publication and dissemination of handbook<br />Members of the OECD Statistical Committee will be asked to endorse the handbook through a written procedure. The handbook will most likely consist of a report of around 100 pages, to be released in both paper and electronic forms. A number of dissemination activities (workshops, seminars) will be held in various OECD countries in mid 2011 to discuss the content and implementation of the handbook.</p>

<DESC>Request for InformationEnterprise-wide Document Management/Records Management (DM/RM) Solution for the US Depart of Labor

RFI Number DOL110RI20828
Notice Type: Request for Information

Synopsis

The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research for an upcoming procurement requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to provide DOL with an enterprise-wide Document Management/Records Management (DM/RM) solution on a firm fixed-price basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this request is 541512, Computer Systems Design Services.  SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. Sources shall include whether or not they are a small business; HUBZone small business; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small business; women-owned small business; or small disadvantaged business in order to assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. 

Background

In support of the President of the United States Transparency and Open Government Initiative, DOL is preparing to implement an enterprise-wide Document Management/Records Management (DM/RM) solution.  This solution will become the Department's Enterprise Content Management (ECM) platform for Agencies within the Department to use for managing, protecting, and retrieving its mission critical documents/records including e-mails. An enterprise-wide ECM platform solution will need to accommodate agency specific as well as universal processes across the Department and employ a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to promote reusable, repeatable service components. Currently, the Department does not have an enterprise-wide electronic records management system that can be used to manage either paper or electronic records.  Moreover, it has disparate document management systems within the nine interconnected Local Area Networks (LANs) that are serving the Agencies across the Department.  DOL anticipates the life cycle of the ECM platform solution to be 10 years.  Refer to the attached DM/RM supporting documents in Appendices A - F for more details on DOLs DM/RM requirements, architecture and data model. 

DOL seeks to understand the number of qualified business vendors/integrators in the ECM industry that are experienced in managing and implementing a comprehensive enterprise-wide Document Management/Records Management (DM/RM) solution through the full investment life cycle that will: 
	Establish the Departments first Department-wide electronic record keeping system enabling Record Managers to retain, schedule, and archive Departmental records electronically (while remaining in compliance with evolving NARA requirements);
	Provide DOL with a systematic capability to manage information that is valuable to the Department and its agencies.  It will provide storage, versioning, ownership, vertical and horizontal sharing, search, and retrieval capabilities in an efficient and effective manner;
	Enable DOL to manage and control unstructured information including documents, emails, and faxes; 
	Address retention issues, and provide a solution that has imaging/scanning capability to convert paper records/files to electronic image files (optional implementation based on Agency needs); and 
	Enable the Department to achieve compliance with Federal mandates, such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, the Federal Records Act, NARA guidance, and E-Discovery requirements according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This will also enable DOL to capture manage and preserve e-mails as records and retrieve such information through electronic searches.

While the specific scope of the documents and records that will be maintained may vary from agency to agency based on their respective mission needs, the intent is to implement a robust and standardized ECM solution in a federated manner across the Department that has a common, configurable user interface and core set of capabilities in handling all types of documents and records, along with their associated metadata.  Through the development of a comprehensive set of DM/RM requirements (included in Appendix D), the following exceptions were determined:

	The DOL DM/RM solution is not anticipated to store classified data;
	The DOL DM/RM solution will not be directly accessed by the public;
	While the solution can house Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) documents and records and can provide basic FOIA capabilities (e.g., annotation, redaction, workflow), this solution is not intended to provide robust FOIA processing capabilities;
	While basic content management functionality is covered (e.g., versioning), the DM/RM solution is not intended to fulfill an online collaboration business need; and 
	Back file conversion of existing paper documents and records is not included in the scope of services. 

The implementation of the DM/RM Department-wide solution is intended to provide system flexibility by providing high-configurability while minimizing customization of requirements.  This will allow individual agencies to leverage a repeatable and re-usable set of DM/RM services to meet their specific customer, business, and records requirements in support of their respective Agency missions.  


Acquisition Approach

DOL anticipates procuring a performance-based acquisition.  The draft Statement of Objectives is included in Appendix E.

Common DM/RM needs and capabilities are grouped into 11 Projects Areas.  Project Types are subsets of the Project Areas based on factors such as, numbers of users, complexity of workflow and complexity of customizations.  A sample description of a project type is included in Appendix F.

The DM/RM solution will be hosted at the contractor facility and implemented incrementally in phases.  Each phase will be defined in terms of the following requirements: project types to be implemented, completion date, availability, user volumes and capacity.   Phase 1 will be the governments contract minimum guarantee. (The Continuity of Operations (COOP) capability will not be a requirement of Phase 1.) Subsequent phases will be defined for evaluation purposes only.  Actual implementations, beyond Phase 1, are dependent on further definition of agency specific requirements and are contingent on the demonstrated success of Phase 1, user readiness and available funding.   For each phase, offerors will configure a solution that consists of hardware, software and implementation services for the required project types.  DOL will provide appropriate network connectivity between the vendors proposed hosting facility and government sites.

The Government will require fixed prices for:
1)	the purchase and maintenance of hardware, ECM and systems software;
2)	the hosting facility and related services;
3)	the implementation and subsequent maintenance and support of each Project Type;
4)	incremental help desk support; and
5)	specific labor categories for potential time and material tasks.

Software license prices and project type implementation prices will include requisite user training.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:<br />The U.S. Coast Guard is seeking information from any Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized repair centers or other equivalent sources that can effectively test, troubleshoot, clean, repair, modify, and overhaul Coast Guard HC-144A Main Landing Gear (MLG), Nose Landing Gear (NLG), shock absorbers, actuating cylinders, Nose Wheel Steering (NWS) components, as well as other associated assemblies, sub-assemblies, and components to current OEM configurations while maintaining any CG specific requirements for their return to service in a Ready For Issue (RFI) condition.
<p>BACKGROUND: <br />The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates eight HC-144A aircraft. The HC-144A is manufactured by EADS CASA Aircraft&nbsp;in Seville, Spain and procured under the authority of the Coast Guard Aviation Program Management Office. The base CASA CN-235-300M provides the foundation for the HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft, changes to base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235-300M. End state for the fleet size is still under review but could include as many as 36 assets. The projected number of Coast Guard assets over the next five years is up to twenty operational HC-144A aircraft with each averaging between 800 - 1200 flight hours annually. These aircraft are operated differently from general aviation in support the Coast Guard Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, as well as surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. USCG HC-144A missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments. These environments accelerate corrosion on airframe structures and components of the aircraft. The Aircraft and its components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).<br /><br />USCG OBJECTIVES: <br />To have all HC-144A MLG, NLG, NWS, sub-assemblies, and components, repaired, modified, and overhauled in accordance with (IAW) OEM specifications using current Repair, Overhaul, and Component Maintenance Manuals, including Revisions, Service Bulletins, Modifications, Amendments, and Specifications. <br /><br />To obtain and maintain a current list and status of all OEM Repair, Overhaul, and Component Maintenance Manuals, including Revisions, Temporary Revisions, Service Bulletins, Modifications, Amendments, or other specifications applicable to the repair, modification, or overhaul of the Coast Guard HC-144A MLG, NLG, NWS, sub-assemblies, and components.. <br /><br />To have all HC-144A MLG, NLG, NWS, sub-assemblies, and components, repaired/overhauled for returned to service with FAA Form 8130-3 or other FAA authorized airworthiness form attached.<br /><br />To track and document flight time, calendar time, flight cycles, landings, and all work performed on HC-144A MLG, NLG, NWS, sub-assemblies, and components undergoing repair, modification, or overhaul as required under USCG ACMS. This is accomplished via a Component Repair Records (CRR) which are used by the CG to update the Significant Component History Reports (SCHR) and to maintain the integrity OEM restoration intervals and life cycle limits as applicable to the HC-144A MLG and NLG assemblies and components. <br />To obtain appropriate repair, modification, and overhaul service levels for Coast Guard HC-144A MLG, NLG, NWS, sub-assemblies, and components. The USCG anticipates multiple levels of services: Repairs, Modifications, and Overhauls, which must be addressed and include any additional levels of service, which may be proposed as such for the separate completion of modifications, incorporation of service bulletins, or the breakout of major components, etc.</p>
<p>REPLIES:<br />All interested parties should respond via Email to: Danny R. Sawyer, HC-144A Contract Specialist at &lt;danny.r.sawyer@uscg.mil&gt; or to CWO Kevin S. Barrick, HC-144A Tech Services, at&lt; kevin.s.barrick@uscg.mil&gt;.</p>

<DESC>Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Aviation Management intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price Commercial Item purchase order to Aero Design Works, for the acquisition of aircraft harnesses for DOI fleet aircraft.  The specially engineered and designed aircraft harnesses are required to provide connectivity and computer interface between the pilot or passenger headsets, aircraft instruments, and a computer to automate wildlife survey data collection.  The harnesses are a unique configuration and they are portable and interchangeable from aircraft to aircraft.  No other known product provides the functionality and connectivity required to support DOI fleet aircraft avionics.  This announcement constitutes the only notice.  The NAICS code is 336413: "Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing."  The sole source authority for this purchase is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  Determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because Aero Design Works was the only provider found for the aircraft harness.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Eurostep America, Inc., of Alexandria, Virginia, for the acquisition of services to process and implement migration tools enabling enterprises to adopt/adapt STEP for their software systems integration needs.
<p>*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.</p>
<p>(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --<br />(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or<br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)</p>
<p>*** Sole source determination is based on ongoing work which was previously conducted with Eurostep America. The Contractor will continue their efforts in doing the following required services:</p>
<p>Demonstrate engineering enterprise integration based on inter-related data exchange, ontology and service specifications; Demonstrate the selective integration of STEP, OMG, and W3C standards; and Demonstrate a process for migrating STEP data models to more widely implemented OMG.</p>
<p>The required work to be completed is directly related to ongoing efforts that Eurostep provided in a contract for the first phase of this project. Eurostep is the only known source that has the existing and available knowledge necessary to complete the follow-on tasks in both an efficient and effective manner. Eurostep is unique in that they have established a long history of experience in all aspects of this type of data modeling and software development. Eurostep participates in both the ISO STEP and OMG standards development communities. Eurostep America is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required services.</p>
<p>*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511, and the size standard is $25 Million.</p>
<p>******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by November 3, 2009 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Parts 5.2 and 6.302-1 this notice advertises the government's intent to negotiate and award a sole source contract for solid waste hauling and disposal services.  Solid waste and recyclable materials generated in the Stehekin valley must be barged to Chelan, WA, for disposal.  The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission regulates solid waste collection companies in the state as franchise territories.  At this time, Tom Courtney, DBA Stehekin Maintenance and Machinery, holds the certificate of public convenience and necessity for Stehekin, WA.   The full Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition will be posted electronically when the contract is awarded.
We intend to negotiate a contract for a base year plus four option years, for a total contract period of up to five years (October 1, 2009 - September 30, 2014).   
Comments and questions regarding this sole source procurement may be directed to Sarah Welch, Administrative Contracting Officer, at sarah_welch@nps.gov.  Include your business name, qualifications, and point of contact.  All comments received on or before Nov. 6, 2009, will be considered.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the <br />Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any<br />other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

The contractor may submit, on a yearly basis, a request for equitable adjustment for taxes, fees, and surcharges to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

Since June 15, lenders across the country have provided millions of dollars in capital to small businesses through the America's Recovery Capital (ARC)loan program. Created under the Recovery Act, the temporary ARC program offers interest-free loans to viable small businesses, which carry a 100 percent guaranty from the SBA to the lender and require no fees paid to SBA. Loan proceeds are provided over a six-month period and repayment of the ARC loan principal is deferred for 12 months after the last disbursement of the proceeds. Repayment can extend up to five years.<br />The ARC loan program is open to any SBA-approved lender. Non-SBA lenders can easily become SBA participants by working with their nearest SBA district office. Businesses interested in applying for an ARC loan should first contact their current lender. If you would like to speak directly to a customer service representative about the ARC Loan Program, please call our toll-free number (866-947-8081) Monday through Friday during the hours of 8am to 6pm (Eastern Time).</span></p>

SBA provides a number of financial assistance programs for small businesses including 7(a), 504 and disaster assistance loans. Within this section, we'll review eligibility requirements, SBA's loan programs, surety bonds and the role of SBA, equity capital topics, special purpose loans, SBA partner topics and 7(a) lender programs. Though the SBA does not provide grants to help you start a business, included is information on organizations and sites that can assist you in locating special purpose grants. Since June 15, lenders across the country have provided millions of dollars in capital to small businesses through the America's Recovery Capital (ARC)loan program. Created under the Recovery Act, the temporary ARC program offers interest-free loans to viable small businesses, which carry a 100 percent guaranty from the SBA to the lender and require no fees paid to SBA. Loan proceeds are provided over a six-month period and repayment of the ARC loan principal is deferred for 12 months after the last disbursement of the proceeds. Repayment can extend up to five years.<br />The ARC loan program is open to any SBA-approved lender. Non-SBA lenders can easily become SBA participants by working with their nearest SBA district office. Businesses interested in applying for an ARC loan should first contact their current lender. If you would like to speak directly to a customer service representative about the ARC Loan Program, please call our toll-free number (866-947-8081) Monday through Friday during the hours of 8am to 6pm (Eastern Time).</span></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation is attached to this announcement.  Solicitation Number N8304090568 is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) for replacement and installation of Double Metal Doors at Jaggar Museum located at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii National Park, Hawaii 96718.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-35 dated 07/15/2009.  This acquisition is conducted under a Small Business Set-aside.  The North American Standard Industrial Classification System code is. 238290 and the small business size standard is $14.0 million.
STATEMENT OF WORK REQUIREMENTS
Background:Two sets of double metal doors, now existing, at the front and side of Jaggar Museum do not lock properly. Most days, doors are propped open for the flow of visitors. On many days, rain comes in through the open (side) doors, saturating the carpet. On vog days, high SO2 concentrations enter the building. Two back steps do not have hand rails. Light from interior spaces is polluting the patio area and affecting night viewing of the Halema'uma'u vent, and star gazing by park visitors.
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has a requirement for replacement of two double metal doors at Jaggar Museum. Doors are located at front entry and side entry on visitor patio/overlook. Replacement of Doors includes hidden panic bars, locking mechanism, kick plates, and all components now present.  In addition to replacement of doors, installation of electronic openers with inside and outside buttons, overhead blowers, and manual shut off controls for both electric doors and air curtains, is required. Some method to prop open doors on nice days is required. Existing doors are NOT electric but electric wiring is present overhead on lit EXIT signs. Installation of electric door controls/buttons will require cutting into existing stone, concrete and/or asphalt. Installation of indoor button(s) will be on interior wall(s). 
Roll down window blinds with a chain system, for lowering and rising is needed. Blinds are to cover 15 windows at 42" x 59" each. Blinds may be approximately 86" to cover two windows at a time.

Price will be a factor in the award decision, although the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price; past performance; compliance with solicitation requirements. Therefore all quoters must submit, their best price and technical data for evaluation. The government intends to evaluate quotes and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-851)<br />2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-267-2285<br />Fax: 202-267-4011</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established seven permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Kathmandu, Nepal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand. The sub-regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators, the multi-year, non-response program strategies for the their respective regions. The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions. The Regional Advisors (RAs), reporting to the PRAs, ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor (RA) in Nairobi, Kenya for OFDA's East and Central Africa Regional Office (ECARO).</p>
<p><br />9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This Regional Advisor position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs. The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The Regional Advisor will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective Principal Regional Advisor, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the Principal Regional Advisor; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;<br />&bull; Coordinate and liaise with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassies, and USAID Missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;<br />&bull; Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report in accordance with OFDA guidelines, policies, and requirements;<br />&bull; Become certified and serve as an Agreement Officer's Technical Representative (AOTR) and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) for grants, cooperative agreements and contracts;<br />&bull; Serve as required as DART Team Leader or as a DART team member during a disaster response;<br />&bull; Maintain regular communications with ECARO (and sub-regional office, if appropriate) and with OFDA/Washington;<br />&bull; Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.<br /><br />B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;<br />&bull; Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA's efforts in disaster response and management;<br />&bull; Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by ECARO.

However, for certain activities, the Regional Advisor will coordinate tasks with the respective Regional Coordinator in OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Principal Regional Advisor will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives. The Regional Advisor is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>**Ammendment as follows: Should a vendor outside of the 25 mile driving radius of FT Riley wish to submit a quote, the method of delivery of the radiators will be FOB Destination of which the offeror will need to include in their quote.**

Description:
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation W912JC-10-R-5700 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) Total Small Business Set Aside. The NAICS is 81198 (set aside standard under $7.0 million). This is a onetime procurement that will be awarded to Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) offeror.  An offer submitted that is below the government estimate by more than 25% may be dismissed without discussion by the contract officer under the assumption the offeror does not fully understand the requirement.

First Article:
A First Article will be required from a vendor tentatively selected prior to contract award in order to determine technical acceptability.  Should a company have previously performed this work satisfactorily for the RSMS or maintained a contract for this service in good standing with the RSMS a first article will not be required.  

Description of Services: 
M939 Series 5-Ton radiators will be delivered to the successful awarded offeror to be cleaned thoroughly, flushed and repaired with hoses and gaskets replaced.  All units overhauled will not have any leaks at the completion of testing.  

Clarification of Standards: This procedure has been designated as an overhaul; however items received for repair will NOT be reconfigured to cause a change in the model designation.  The overhaul is an imprecise term which means that enough work is done on the radiator unit to make it fully operational again and typically no root cause analysis is performed for these types of repairs.  New parts may be used as needed to complete these repairs.

This procedure is NOT a reconditioning as defined by FAR PART 52.211-5 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, which means restored to the original normal operating condition by readjustments and material replacement. 

Shipping and Delivery Schedule:
These radiators will be delivered to and also picked up from the awarded contractor in increments between 10-20 units at a time over the next ten months from the award date for an estimated total of 148 units.  This below delivery schedule is an estimate only and may vary.  Prices quotes for the services required may be itemized however one price per unit overhaul shall be submitted.  The price shall be the same for each unit based on the estimated quantities shown below.  Any unserviceable core shall be set aside for return to the RSMS.

The facility occupies approximately 40 acres and utilizes about 130 acres for the Heavy Equipment Training Program.     

The program meets the needs of each individual in four (4) specific areas that enable the trainee to become successfully employed.  Although many other needs are also being met, the program focuses on building vocational skills, developing academic skills and increasing awareness of social skills and core values.

Besides educational and vocational opportunities, trainees receive housing, meals, medical and dental care, as well as living and clothing allowances.  There are daily recreational activities and outings scheduled weekly for all trainees who wish to participate.  Counseling services are available to assist trainees with their individual needs.

When training is completed and/or trainees are ready to leave, Career Transition services are provided.  In addition, trainees who leave and are pursuing independent living are provided assistance with their transition.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for Advanced Metering and Controls for an Energy Management System. The purpose of this RFP is to invite qualified suppliers of energy monitoring and metering systems to provide their Energy Management System (EMS) solution to the USPS meeting our requirements outlined within the solicitation.   For the purposes of this solicitation, the EMS is defined in general, as the monitoring of power consumption (advanced metering/submetering) and the monitoring, and controlling of the environmental parameters associated with a building HVAC system.  To be considered, each supplier is to submit a Management Plan/Technical Factors and a price proposal.  The project is estimated from todays data that total costs will range between $7.5 million per year and $22.5 million over three years. The primary goal is to obtain a level of functionality within the installed system such that the buildings energy vital signs, primarily HVAC performance and electrical, water, and gas consumption, can be monitored by the USPS from a remote location via the USPSs Enterprise Energy Management System (EEMS).  Communication will utilize the USPS intranet.  The specific application shall provide monitoring/control capability for the USPS Medium Standard Building Design (MSBD) facilities that typically range from 10,000 to 60,000 square feet.   These systems utilize roof top units or heat pumps for heating and cooling.  The proposed system must utilize open architecture and allow interactive control across the network through direct communication with the field panel.  No computers or software outside the Suppliers equipment are to be required at the site.  As USPS standards call for BACnet protocol compliance, the Suppliers ability to comply with BACnet protocols and integration with the USPSs EEMS is essential.  The communication link between the USPSs offsite EEMS and the Suppliers EMS shall be considered compliant if the Suppliers BACnet hardware/software has been certified by the BACnet Testing Labs (BTL).  Systems that utilize non-certified BACnet protocol will be considered, although as a reduced value.  By selecting devices built on the USPS standard protocol, BACnet, USPS is working toward nationwide standardization and integration of all building systems under one management tool.  All installations will be at broadband internet enabled offices, so monitoring and control must be compatible with the USPS WAN/LAN.  In all situations, connectivity shall follow the rules and security standards of the USPS Corporate IT.   The communication protocol within the Suppliers system (I/O between devices) shall be either BACnet or MODbus.  Wireless communications are not required but will be considered.  Subcontracting goals for this project are: 35.8% Small Business Enterprise, 3.60% for Minority Business Enterprise, and 5.80% for Woman Owned Business Enterprise.  All questions concerning this solicitation shall only be directed in writing in WORD format to Michael Bacha at michael.j.bacha2@usps.gov.  Questions shall be clear, concise, numbered and dated.  Do not attempt to contact anyone else during this process as only answers issued from Michael Bacha will be included in Amendment(s) issued.  A pre-proposal conference will be held at Tuesday October 20, 2009; Time: 10:00 AM; Location: 4301 Wilson Blvd, Conference Room C3, Arlington, VA  22203.  Proposals are due on November 6, 2009 at 3:00pm EST and should be hand delivered or mailed (using one of the fine services offered by the Postal Service) to the attention of Michael Bacha, SMFP, Suite 300, 4301 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22203-1840.

The Expert Particle Analysis System comprises a high-resolution field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) coupled with a state-of ?the-art energy-dispersive xray spectrometer (EDS) and advanced software and analytical tools customized for the EPA to facilitate manual and computer controlled SEM (CCSEM) data acquisition and data analysis of environmental samples.  The EPAS system will provide size, shape, images, and elemental composition for particles ranging in size from millimeters down to tens of nanometers.  Data obtained from the EPAS will be applied in source apportionment studies, ambient air monitoring, human exposure and health effects research, nanomaterials research, and other environmental studies.
INSTRUMENT PLATFORM:
Type -The SEM must be a Field-Emission SEM
Resolution - Better than 2 nm resolution in high resolution mode 
Stage - 5 axis semi-compucentric stage, with motorized x, y motions of at least 80 mm x 60 mm, with x and y axis stage movement tolerance of +/- 0.25 microns, and with position repeatability at +/- 1 micron

Ability to create multiple particle data sets through parameterized methods, (i.e. varing sets of chemical elements in the quantifications and classifications) without having to re-acquire the data.  
Ability to calculate ambient particle mass and elemental concentrations (ug/m3) for passive aerosol samples based on individual particle data using demonstrated procedures.  Ability to compensate for EDS background from sample substrate, e.g., carbon stripping, while accounting for particle size.  Ability to create Ad-Hoc Data Summarizations.  Ability to create analysis project templates, and reuse settings which include particle attribute calculations, custom attributes classification methods and summaries.
Additional Specifications General Requirements

<DESC>(Start Description) The purpose of the USAID/Afghanistan Vertical Structures Indefinite Quantity Contract (VS-IQC) is to undertake selected facility assessment, renovation, refurbishment and construction activities. The task orders awarded under the VS-IQC will provide the USAID/Afghanistan Office of Infrastructure, Engineering and Energy (OIEE) with short and medium-term design and construction services relating to a variety of building facility types to support the objective of fostering sustainable infrastructure development in Afghanistan. The VS-IQC will provide various services including design-build, construction, and construction management services required to erect vertical structures within Afghanistan. It is the intent of the VS-IQC to issue work by means of separate task orders. Task order statements of work will vary for each activity depending on the specific project requirements. Pricing and completion schedules, whether firm-fixed price or cost plus fixed fee, will be required under each task order. The specific nature of the work to be performed will be as contained within the individual task order statement of work. A full range of services may be required, from the initial stages of program development and planning, through all aspects of design that may be performed by either the Contractor or others, to the end result of completion of a construction project or service contract including the turnover of facilities constructed or completion of the required services. The Contractor shall demonstrate a high degree of flexibility by providing design-build services, construction, and construction management services involving the fullest range of management, supervisory, administrative, planning, engineering, quality control, construction oversight, and project closeout activities associated with all aspects of the development of facilities infrastructure within Afghanistan in the present and foreseeable future. The estimated period of performance of multiple-award IQC contracts to be awarded from this competition will be five years from date of award. The cumulative estimated value of all the task orders to be issued under all "basic" IQC contracts shall not exceed $300,000,000. The objective of this pre-solicitation notice is to alert potential offerors that USAID/Afghanistan&rsquo;s Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) intends to issue a request for proposals so as to afford potential offerors the advanced opportunity to: 1) Organize a proposal preparation team; 2) Begin recruitment of personnel; and, 3) Make teaming arrangements.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALTO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the CAI Frederick, Frederick, MD, on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition and Logistic (OAL) Policy and Programs division. 2.   Nature/Description of Action.This activity proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award (sole source) with Ambit Group LLC, for the procurement of services for:  1) Branding strategy and communication outreach.3.  Description of Supplies/Services.The purpose of this requirement is to continue services with the incumbent who is currently finalizing baseline Transformation initiatives for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Acquisition and Logistics (OAL) division.  The VA is undergoing a Transformation process that will enable VA to meet twenty first century mandates.  Meeting these mandates will allow VA to accomplish its myriad of missions more effectively and efficiently in support of the nation's Veterans.  The VA must provide cutting-edge information technology, innovative and improved acquisition processes to service the growing and changing population of Veterans.  A substantial transformation of the VA workforce, along with end-to-end innovations in management is required.  Within this environment there are many challenges to be met. As part of the VA enterprise transformation, VA leadership has committed to addressing these priority mission challenges that will involve Veterans, VA suppliers, VA partners, and management at all staff levels and within the Administrations.  VA opened this new dialogue at a recent Supplier Relationship Transformation Forum, and is building on this momentum by establishing an array of initiatives to meet VA Transformation goals and objectives.  This procurement requires various services in support of program development, and management with a focus on the critical areas required to support the transformation effort as noted above in paragraph 2.  Ambit Group LLC is currently providing assistance to VA on Transformation initiative's under their existing award.  The estimated value of this requirement is $449,276.98 for the base year and 299,570.04 for option year one, 258,074.37 for option year two, 199,519.98 for option year three, and 197,476.84 for option year four.  This brings the aggregate value of this requirement to $1,403,918.21. 4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR 6.302-5.  The applicable statute is Public Law 109-461, Veterans First Contracting Program.5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.Ambit Group LLC has provided VA contractual assistance on numerous VA initiatives in the past.  Currently, Ambit Group LLC is working on a critical element of VA's transformation process.  Under their current award Ambit Group LLC assisted VA with several baseline Transformation initiatives including the supplier aspect of the 360 degree Customer Satisfaction Key Performance Indicator (KPI) project; a Supplier Relationship Transformation Forum (SRTF) to facilitate discussion on customer satisfaction with selected VA suppliers; the primary construction of a survey tool to be further developed by Michigan State University (MSU) which will be used to survey the entire VA supplier population; and a baseline doctrine for VA governance along with various related media.  Ambit Group LLC is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concern with competencies in an array of disciplines that include management, organization, business, information technology, acquisition, strategic planning and facilitation.  Ambit Group LLC was recently recognized as SDVOSB business of the year for 2008.  Ambit Group LLC has provided service for numerous federal agencies in the District of Washington over the past 5 years.  They have a staff of competent senior-level subject matter experts, professional consultants and facilitators.  This requirement includes several functions that Ambit Group LLC has demonstrated the ability and knowledge to perform.  Also, Ambit Group LLC is familiar with the VA's transformation process due to their previous experience with the VA.  The new procurement requires support of program development and management across the five critical areas as noted in paragraph 2.  Securing Ambit Group LLC to accomplish the next phase of the transformation process will provide continuity from the previous work they provided and allow for gains in the area of economics and efficiencies which will best enable VA to meet its Transformation objectives and goals.6.  Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.This acquisition will not be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunity System pursuant to the exception granted at FAR 5.202(a)(4).  The next opportunity for award will be considered on a case-by-case basis for award. 7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices.No award shall be made until the Contracting Officer determines the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.  This determination will be based on a comparison of the Independent Government Cost Estimate and AMBIT Group LLC's proposal. 8.  Description of Market Survey.Market research was conducted using VetBiz.gov.  We determined that Ambit Group LLC is a responsible source with respect to this contracting opportunity.  They are registered and certified in VetBiz.gov as a SDVOSB with the NAICS code for this requirement which in accordance with Public Law 109-461 Section 502(c) meets the requirements of this statute to sole source to a SDVOSB.9.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.PL109-461 Section 502(c) states:SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTS FOR CONTRACTS ABOVE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD.  For purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a contracting officer of the Department may award a contract to a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans using procedures other than competitive procedures if ---(1)	Such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;(2)	The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403)) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and(3)	In the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.This procurement meets all of these conditions.10.  Listing of Interested Sources.Ambit Group LLC 1895 Preston White drive Reston, Virginia 20191-543411.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis. CERTIFICATIONSTechnical Representative Certification:I certify that the foregoing justification is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.____________________				____________John Eldridge						DateContract AdministratorVA Central Office, Office of Acquisition andLogistic Policy and Programs, Washington, DC Contracting Officer CertificationPursuant to (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)), I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief._______________________				____________Teresa M.
