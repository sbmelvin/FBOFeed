<p>Description</p>
<p>The AFNWC/PKO will be soliciting a Competitive 8(a) Set-Aside, competitive Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build construction efforts to support the 377 MSG/CE mission at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. Competition will be restricted to companies within the State of New Mexico. Current A&amp;E contractors on contract at Kirtland AFB are not permitted to participate. Contractors shall also have a functional office in the State of New Mexico not a satellite office. This acquisition will encompass requirements that have, in the past, been acquired utilizing the Base Maintenance Contract. Individual Task Order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task Order limits will be $2,000 to $3,000,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $64M over a five-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p><br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $33.5M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $33.5M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, painting, roofing and paving. Locations of work will be at Kirtland AFB, NM. Offers are solicited only from business concerns current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.</p>
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, targeted toward competitive offerors with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to six (6) contracts to 8(a) small businesses, who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet the requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The seed project consists of a facility expansion, LRPD Advanced HPM Research Facility Expansion (Project # MHMV 110112). The seed project magnitude is between $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Kirtland AFB plans to include the following factors and sub-factors:</p>
<p>1) Mission Capability<br />2) Past Performance<br />3) Price/Cost</p>
<p>Within the Mission Capability Factor the following 4 sub-factors will be used:</p>
<p>a) Organizational Structure and Staffing <br />b) Technical Capability/Execution and Completeness of the Seed Project<br />c) Change and Cost Control Management<br />d) Quality Control Program</p>
<p>The Mission Capability and Past Performance factors will be afforded primary emphasis in the evaluation, are considered equal in importance, and, when combined, are significantly more important than the Price/Cost factor. Price/Cost, however, will contribute substantially to the selection decision and will be assessed for reasonableness. The sub-factors within each factor are considered equal in importance.</p>
<p>Up to six (6) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive a basic contract award. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project.<br />All future task orders will be competed among all the contract awardees. All contractors receiving award will receive a not-to-exceed $2,000 Task Order for the MACC Orientation Seminar to satisfy the contract minimum requirement.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 15 Feb 2012 and close on or about 30 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>

<DESC><p>The Department of Defense Dependents Schools Europe (DoDDS-E) intends to award a sole source contract for facilities and grounds maintenance for schools in Aviano, Livorno and Vicenza, Italy and the District Superintendent Office in Vicenza, Italy pursuant to FAR 52.302-1, 10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. A limited sole source contract will be established for the incumbent, SKE Support Services GmbH, to provide continued maintenance and repair services for a period not to exceed a base period of two (2) months with four (4) one-month option periods while the DoDDS-E Procurement Division establishes a competitive follow-on contract in 2012. The proposed contractor has provided routine/preventative maintenance and repair, demand maintenance and repair and 24/7 hour support and response for DoDDS facilities in the Vicenza, Livorno, and Aviano areas over the past five (5) years.</p>
<p>Soliciting offers in a full and open competition for this limited period of performance would significantly impact the ability of providing a fully operational education environment for the locations/schools described. As current services are set to expire on March 7th, 2012, there is not enough time to effectively solicit proposals under full and open competition whereby the Government contracting office could responsibly provide potential contractors with a reasonable amount of time to develop strong and accurate contract proposals to support services described. Furthermore, the potential award of this type of maintenance contract to a new contractor will require a lengthy transition period of at least sixty (60) days by which the new contractor must: fully staff all locations described, train new or established employees, establish base access for all employees, perform detailed inspection of the facility to gain a better understanding of the systems current level of maintenance, perform turnover of all outstanding preventive and demand maintenance actions, develop preventative maintenance action plans in order to allow for continued operation of the facilities systems, procure and mobilize all needed equipment and tools to provide services in question. The locations/schools described cannot afford any disruption in services of routine preventative/demand maintenance and continue to remain operational. Inevitable delays related to demand maintenance requirements will present unacceptable challenges to the teaching, administrative, and support staff to meet their educational mission requirements.</p>
<p>A solicitation (HE1280-11-R-0001) has been released under full and open competition with a contract for similar maintenance support services that is expected to be awarded within the next six months. Until the solicitation (HE1280-11-R-0001) has been awarded, recurring preventative/demand maintenance services for the schools in question need to be provided by the current contractor.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified points of contact, Ms. Gina Romano, e-mail: Gina.Romano@eu.dodea.edu, and Ms. Bernadette Honish, e-mail: Bernadette.Honish@eu.dodea.edu, not later than 8:30 am Eastern Standard time, USA, on February 10, 2012. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as The Berry Amendment) impose restrictions on the DoDs acquisition of foreign products and services.  Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and specialty metals (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014), including the materials and components thereof (other than sensors, electronics, or other items added to, and not normally associated with clothing), must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.

New DOD requirements for wood packaging material (WPM) have been developed in response to international implementation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization protocol on International Standards for Phytosanitary 
Measures (ISPM) 15. ISPM 15 is designed to block movement of pests that can destroy forests from one nation to another. DOD shipments inside and outside of the United States must meet ISPM 15 whenever WPM is used to ship DOD cargo. (For more information, see the American Lumber Standard Committee, Incorporated Web page at http://www.alsc.org.) The new WPM requirements will be reflected in DLA solicitations and awards issued on or after August 1, 2006. WPM is defined in the clause at DLAD 52.247-9012, Requirements for Treatment of Wood Packaging Material. (Note that DOD does not endorse the Methyl Bromide Fumigation Program. Only heat treatment or kiln dried heat treatment of WPM are authorized.) After August 1, 2006, contractors can be held accountable for taking corrective action on noncompliant shipments.



DSCP has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page.

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

  Regis & Associates PC is the only source with the prerequisite background with the specific programs, activity and command efforts.  Any break in service in support of the Navy Secretariat Financial Operations will severely impact DONAA/FMDs ability to meet its fiduciary obligations to the Secretary of the Navy. This would place SECNAV and the Assistant Secretaries of the Navy financial accounts at high risk of incurring Anti-Deficiency Violations without the proper financial oversight and management.  
The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611; size standard $7M.  All inquiries regarding this sole-source procurement shall be sent to the Contract Specialist, Sean M.
 Bennett at sean.m.bennett@navy.mil.

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia will be renewing the current Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the Auxiliary Power Units (APU) systems and other APU components with Hamilton Sundstrand (Cage Codes 55820 and 73030) in the Spring of 2014.   Under the proposed follow-on contract, the contractor will continue to provision, stock, repair, modify and/or replace, store and ship serviceable Ready-For-Issue (RFI) equipment directly to the end user within guaranteed delivery time frames.  The renewal PBL contract will require an integrated product life cycle approach whereby the contractor assumes responsibility for many management and support functions related to the PBL such as engineering and logistics support.
  The PBL contract may require both reliability sustainment and reliability improvements.  Hamilton Sundstrand will be required to independently meet system demand metrics or flying hour metrics through WRA /LRU repair and replacement, guaranteed availability, reliability and inventory management.  The contractor will also manage technical configurations changes and obsolescence issues.

The contractor will be required partner with various organic depots such as FRC-E (Cherry Point), Hill Air Force Base, etc.  and to renew and/or execute new Commercial Services Agreements.

The renewal PBL contract may add coverage for Navy V-22 APUs and components; may include coverage for Air Force F-16/KC-135/B-2 APUs and components; may include Army CH-47 and H-60 APUs and components; and may also include coverage for DLA unique parts as well as piece parts in support of O and I levels.
  

The maximum period of performance for this effort will not exceed 10 years.   Justification for Sole Source Acquisition:  the statutory authority applicable to permit other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) with only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.  Hamilton Sundstrand, Cage Codes 55820 and 73030 is the OEM for the Navy H-46/H-53/V-22 APUs and APU components, the Air Force F-16/KC135/B-2 APUs and APU components , the Army CH-47/H-60 APUs and APU components only Hamilton Sundstrand alone has the engineering expertise and technical data necessary to perform essential PBL tasks such  as repair, resolution of obsolescence issues, sustainment of reliability and management of configuration of the Navys Critical Safety Item/Critical Application Item WRAs/SRAs covered by the contemplated procurement.
  In addition, applicable depot repair manuals which define the tear down, inspection and reassembly of the WRAs/SRAs, identify Hamilton Sundstrand as the only source of supply for various major parts such as shafts, housings and gears.   Further, only Hamilton Sundstrand owns the necessary design, configuration, manufacturing, production and process data capable to perform the required reliability sustainments/improvements required and has access to the original design data/OEM intellectual property. 
 
Subcontracting Opportunities:  All businesses interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Hamilton Sundstrand.  

For newer platforms, such as the V-22, reliability improvements are of a nature that will require Hamilton Sundstrand to be deeply involved in configuration management issues and systems engineering design changes, which will require access to original design data and OEM intellectual property.

The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for innovative energy technology demonstrations that address DoD requirements as candidates for funding.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ESTCP's intent to competitively fund demonstration projects as described in the Program Announcement on the ESTCP web site.  <br><br>The Program Announcement which includes specific topics and complete submittal instructions is found at;<br><br>www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/ESTCP-Solicitations/Energy-Solicitation   <br><br>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  Awards will take the form of contracts.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan. <br><br>To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the  instructions on the web site, no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, March 29, 2012.  No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.  <br><br>Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process.  The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit technology demonstrations for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal.  Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by ESTCP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether ESTCP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal.  Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals, ESTCP will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal.<br><br>Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification.  A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award.  There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made.  It is expected that multiple awards will be made to address a particular topic area.  It is expected that awards totaling approximately $20.0 million will result, depending on availability of funds.  <br><br>Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value.  If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are 541712 and 541330 with the small business size standard of 500 employees and $4.5M respectively.  Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION. The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. Previous 4P A-E contracts have used NAICS code 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees. We anticipate awarding approximately 10-20 contracts to large and small businesses. We are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for CONUS (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region in addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other) will be similar for all contracts. However the TYPE of projects/programs (i.e. MILCON, MFH, SRM) is anticipated to differ between the worldwide and regional IDIQ suites.</p>
<p>We anticipate the development of two separate Statements of Work (SOW), one for worldwide IDIQ awards and one for regional IDIQ awards. However for this RFI the attached DRAFT SOW covers all anticipated services and project/program efforts. The attached DRAFT SOW has changed substantially from the current AFCEE 4PA-E08 SOW. Sections 8.0, 13.2 and 14.0 are examples of scope areas that have been significantly revised or updated. Recommend review of entire SOW. All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Time &amp; Materials (T&amp;M) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with three additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION. These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts. The ordering period under the 4P A-E08 contracts expire during the Feb - Aug 2013 timeframe. <br />ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF WORLDWIDE SERVICES<br />To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for environmental and traditional MILCON, Military Family Housing (including projects related to Privatized Housing), and SRM projects. The SRM projects will be limited to locations overseas and contingency operations (as defined under 10 USC, 101 (a)(13)). The anticipated services include:</p>
<p>&bull; Title I Services: Title I services are related to a specific construction project and consist of conducting field surveys and investigations to obtain design data and preparing contract plans, specifications, and cost estimates. Title I services may include all aspects of design such as preparation and/or review of contract plans, specifications, scheduling, cost estimates, building commissioning services and preparation of operating and design manuals. Title I efforts also encompass those efforts required to support and develop design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, studies, investigations, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, and operation, monitoring, topographic survey services, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems<br /><br />&bull; Title II Services: Title II services are related to a specific construction project and consist of supervision and inspection of construction. Title II services may include all aspects of construction quality assurance and oversight of environmental and facility construction and renovation projects</p>
<p>&bull; Other A-E Services: These services are design and construction-related services, but are not connected with a specific construction project.

<DESC>F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) Follow-on Services Sources Sought Notice
<p>Description<br />I. Sources Sought Synopsis: This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted.</p>
<p>a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-16 Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC services contract in April 2012. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award. <br />b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS.<br />c) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Sources Sought Synopsis, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br />d) Background: The F-16 MTCs are currently operating at the following Air Force Bases: Shaw, Misawa, and Spangdahlem. The F-16 MTCs are part of the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) Program. DMO is an operational readiness initiative that networks geographically separated training devices in a real-time synthetic battlefield. It is scalable to provide individual, team, and team-of-teams combat training and mission rehearsal. It is the backbone for the Virtual Flag exercise used for AEF spin-up and the cornerstone of the AF training transformation. The F-16 MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. Currently this capability is provided through a training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end in April 2012.</p>
<p>e) The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, non-personal services contract with a total delivery period of no fewer than one and a half (1.5) years and no more than three (3) years (one base year period with four six month options).</p>
<p>f) All services will be housed in Government facilities and utilized by personnel designated by the government. Government-contracted instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons.</p>
<p>g) Payment for training services under this contract will commence with start of service at each site.</p>
<p>h) The purpose of this SSS is to determine offeror interest in providing F-16 MTC simulation services to the Air Force.</p>
<p>II. Program Requirements:</p>
<p>a) This document specifies the performance requirements for the United States Air Force (USAF) F-16 Block 50 Mission Training Center (MTC) System Services that provide interim training services between the current contract, FA8621-07-D-6272, and the Full-Up F-16 Block 40/42/50/52 System Procurement contract. In this document the term Block 50 refers to F-16 Block 50/52. System Services refers to the total services provided under this contract, to include, but not limited to F-16 MTC simulation, security, mission control, and support capabilities. An F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) shall consist of a four-ship F-16 system simulation along with scenario generation capability and two briefing/debriefing stations. Each System Simulation will consist of a representation of the appropriate F-16 aircraft model, both cockpit and software simulation, Instructor Operator Station (IOS), and a synthetic environment.

<p>2) Synthetic Environment. The F-16 MTC shall include a realistic, high fidelity synthetic environment capable of supporting a full range of mission training and operations for day/night, low altitude, and all-weather missions for the full range of weapon systems and sensors. The F-16 MTC shall provide an inter-correlated and intra-correlated environment for all visuals (OTW, NVG, EO/IR), audio, radar, datalink, electronic combat, navigation, weapons, mission functions, and Master Entity Database simulations used for all training and mission events. The synthetic environment shall support single, two, three, or four ship operations for stand-alone missions, local network missions, and DMO Events. The synthetic environment shall provide the capability to engage a full range of potential threats and targets, to include ground/surface/air forces and moving models, in accordance with operational Air Force mission planning systems generated scenarios.</p>
<p>3) Instructor Operator Station (IOS). The IOS shall provide the instructor with the capability to assess performance (tasks and tactics) and support real-time instruction to any cockpit or selected group of cockpits (local and DMO). The IOS shall provide the degree of oversight required to conduct formal aircrew qualification and mission evaluations from the IOS by a flight examiner. The capability to select and monitor any combination of all displays and instrument indications of each cockpit shall be provided. The capability to rapidly select and simultaneously view four cockpit displays or sensors shall be provided. The capability to select and view four cockpit displays or sensors shall be user friendly for minimal delay and disruption to the console instructor. The IOS shall provide the capability to select an overhead God's eye view of the engagement area with the capability to zoom in and out, and 3-dimensionally rotate any areas of interest, and turn on/off entity trails. The IOS shall provide the capability to insert malfunctions during generation, setup, or execution of scenarios (preprogram or manually input) for all aircraft, systems, and weapons. The IOS shall have the capability for secure private communication with any other IOS within the F-16 MTC and with any individual crew under its control.</p>
<p>4) Visual Display System. The visual simulation shall provide high fidelity OTW and sensor (including NVIS and Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS)) views correlated together along with all displayed information in the cockpit to support instruments, navigation, A/G, and A/A missions. Visual cues presented to the pilot shall simulate those in the F-16 aircraft and shall not present false, erroneous, or inappropriate perceptions that would adversely impact aircrew training. The visual simulation shall support realistic Detection, Orientation, Recognition, Identification (DORI), target range, aspect angle, and closure rate determination by crew members for all targets and threats. The visual simulation shall support mission report functions such as visual Line-of-Sight (LOS) ranging, LOS material property, LOS entity ID, height of terrain, weapons impact detection, collisions detection, and intervisibility testing. Terrain and other solid objects shall appropriately limit physical flyout of weapons. The visual simulation shall display realistic representations of hostile and friendly weapons effects (e.g., missiles in flight, AAA, bomb detonations, cluster bomb detonations, smoke columns, multi-state damaged models, countermeasures, SAM launch blast, SAM trajectory, and gun tracer trajectory).</p>
<p>5) Networking. The F-16 MTC shall be capable of providing distributed exercise and regular recurring DMO participation. The system shall interoperate with other existing and planned DMO Systems and shall comply with the adopted DMO System Standards. The F-16 MTC shall operate as a participating DMO Federate System in the DMO System for distributed network training. The F-16 MTC shall support the simultaneous conduct of any combination of local single-ship and networked missions, and DMO Events. The DMON will be interconnected with other Department of Defense (DoD) military services' training systems in the future to accommodate Joint Task Force (JTF) training. The F-16 MTC shall not develop any unique architecture or non-standards-compliant interfaces that would preclude or otherwise limit DMO connectivity and interoperability. No degradation in operating performance shall be noticed in the F-16C MTC when operating in the DMO environment except as limited by fidelity or interoperability of external entities not under the control of the F-16 MTC. All missions and operations supported in the local training modes shall be supported in the DMO environment. This includes training with external constructive, virtual, or live entities.</p>
<p>6) Briefing/Debriefing (B/DB) Capability. The F-16 MTC shall include two B/DB capable rooms. The B/DB rooms shall have a minimum occupancy of 8 people per room. The B/DB rooms shall be interchangeable and B/DB shall be able to operate simultaneously at multiple levels of security. The B/DB shall support mission generation/modification capabilities. The B/DB shall provide simultaneous video teleconferencing to support briefing and debriefing without degrading any local mission or DMO Event in progress. The B/DB capability shall operate at the same network security level as the mission being supported. The briefing capability shall support commercial briefing presentation formats commonly used by F-16 instructors and flight leads for accessing and presenting squadron briefings. The briefing capability shall support pre-mission planning and briefing to prepare F-16 pilots for any existing mission scenario, and shall be interoperable with Air Force mission planning systems. For DMO Events, the briefing capability shall support simultaneous viewing of presentation data with secure distributed participant teleconference video and audio. The debriefing capability shall support debriefing of the F-16 pilots for any recorded mission scenario. The debriefing capability shall permit the playback of recorded segments of a mission scenario from each local cockpit's perspective and a God's eye view at normal and accelerated speeds. The debriefing capability shall display a summary on the effectiveness of maneuvers, countermeasures, weapons delivery, and the percentage of damage incurred on a target for battle damage assessment. B/DB shall include a large display three-dimensional or God's eye view (vertical, horizontal, or from any point in space) of the scenario with a zoom capability to observe selected views of the engagement. Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) performance may be used as a guide. The B/DB capability shall support mission situational awareness by providing mission playback from any perspective of the battlefield, selectable cockpit views (friendly, neutral, hostile), stealth views and tied/wingman visuals with appropriate parameters (friendly, neutral, or hostile), while simultaneously displaying information from all F-16 MTCs. B/DB shall include a display area per cockpit simulator to allow simultaneous display of each crew's recorded information. Changing views or display options shall be available real-time during playback.</p>
<p>e) F-16 pilots obtain over 20 percent of their overall training events through the MTC; therefore, Air Combat Command requires no break in training during the transition from the incumbent contractor. <br />f) F-16 MTCs must be delivered and maintained in a fully operational status that remains concurrent with the home station aircraft configuration and that maintains the ability to be available for use at least 95 percent of the time. The operational hours for Shaw AFB are ten (10) hours per day, five (5) days a week; Misawa and Spangdahlem operate eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days a week.</p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898 on behalf of the Precision Fires Rocket and Missile Systems (PFRMS) Project Office, Program Executive Office Missiles and Space, hereby issues the following Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) to ascertain the level of interest of potential vendors desiring to contract for the development and production of an improved Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rocket . This RFI is released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e).  Interested sources will provide a white paper describing their recommended strategies. Responses must be in compliance with all applicable Army, DoD and Federal policies. <br><br>Requirement Statement:<br>The desired improvements in a next generation GMLRS rocket are: <br>-	Increase the maximum range from the current capability up to 250 km with minimal impact on the current minimum range capability of 15 km. A minimum of two missiles per launcher pod is desired.  Range, number of missiles per pod, and warhead weight are the major performance characteristics to be considered.  Performance and system cost are of equal importance.<br><br>-	Using a single warhead, provide scalable lethality effects equivalent to high explosive blast/fragment warheads ranging from 50 lb to 250 lb of high explosive.  <br><br>o	This desired lethality capability will permit engagement of both point targets and/or wide area targets. The desire is a warhead capable of meeting both GMLRS and TACMS point and imprecisely located targets. <br><br>o	This lethality will be selectable in discreet increments either in the Fire Mission Digital Message or by the Fire Control Panel Operator on the launcher.  <br><br>-	This warhead will have the capability to operate in a proximity mode, point detonation mode, or time delay after impact mode. <br><br>-	The rockets will be housed within a Launch Pod Container (LPC).  The physical dimensions of the LPC (i.e. height, width, length and weight), as well as the mechanical interface, must be compatible with the current M270 series, M142 launchers and existing logistical assets.  The LPC must be usable with the current family of launchers to avoid the cost of developing new launchers and to avoid costly changes to current logistical/material handling equipment.<br><br>-	Rocket time of flight from launch to target engagement will be consistent with current MFOM (MLRS Family of Munitions) rockets; with no greater than 10 percent degradation. The desire is to maintain the same terminal velocities as the current rockets to deny the enemy the ability to detect the incoming rocket and take measures to vacate, go into a protective posture or activate point defenses.<br><br>-	System level Insensitive Munition compliance is required.<br><br>-	The rocket should be capable of 90 degree terminal Angle of Fall (AOF) (plus or minus 10 degrees) for all ranges between the minimum range plus ten percent and maximum range minus twenty percent. AOF enables employment in rugged/high mountainous areas with intervening crests, as well as complex urban terrain.<br><br>-	GPS anti-jam capability or navigation solutions will be capable of maintaining sufficient accuracy.<br><br>-	Solutions with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 5 or greater are requested.  Solutions possessing lower TRL levels should include a plan and projected cost/schedule and risk matrix to achieve a TRL 6 prior to the Technology Demonstration Phase of the program.<br><br>-	Industry is also encouraged to suggest methods of contracting for development, test, and production of the next generation GMLRS configuration<br><br>RFI Purpose/Limitations<br>A Request for Proposal (RFP) for this effort may be issued in the future. The Government is seeking white papers regarding the technical approach to this development and industry's assessment/opinion of the most efficient and cost effective method of executing this effort.   The response should include:  (1.) a tier one schedule showing events from contract award to delivery of the first production (200 pods per year) to the U.S. Government that can be type classified, with full materiel release and (2.) a cost estimate (MS Excel file) for development which includes personnel, hardware, test range support and facilitization of the production facility to attain LRIP and full rate production, and unit production cost.  Unit production estimates should include a major components breakout. The potential levels of production are: 500, 1000, and 1500 rocket systems per year.  Industry is also encouraged to describe the benefits or risks associated with inclusion of production options and recommendations on contracting approaches that provide a best value to the Government while minimizing risk (especially cost risk) to the selected development contractor.<br> <br>The documents listed below are available for authorized DOD contractors eligible to receive Distribution C and D documents, and will be distributed on a case by case basis.  Appropriate legal and security requirements will be satisfied prior to providing any requested technical data.<br><br>Functional Baseline Interface Control Documents (ICDs): <br> 	13214701 (POD-TO-M270A1 Launcher Interface) Rev Dash <br> 	MIS-48811 (Interface Control Document for the M270A1 Launcher to Munitions Launch Pod Assembly Interface) Rev B<br> 	MIS-49157 (Missile Command Specification Interface Control Document for the Rocket Pod, 298MM, M31 Rocket) Rev E<br> 	Interface control document for the multiple launch rocket system fire control system (International) (Document number: 11508910/01 Rev D)<br> 	United states only interface control document for version 6.0 of the MLRS fire control system (U.S. Only) (Document number: 11508910/02 Rev D)<br> 	Pod to M270A1 Launcher Interface (Document Number: 13214701 Rev Dash)<br> 	Cage Interface Control Drawing ( Document Number 13027605 Rev G)<br><br>The Government's intent is to better understand the current, state-of-the-art capabilities and strategies to determine the best solution. Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas. Proprietary information is neither solicited nor prohibited; however, if submitted, it should be appropriately marked. Please limit your formal white paper submission to no more than 20 pages, to include cover letter. In addition five attachments consisting of briefing slides, pre-printed commercial brochures or sales literature may be included. Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged.

RFI Announcement<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotations. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they effect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach. Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Interested vendors responding to this RFI may provide capability information for all pieces of this requirement or for an entire solution. Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided; however information gathered may be utilized for technical and acquisition purposes. The U.S. Government will not pay for any costs associated with such demonstration(s) of any software products.<br />This is an RFI and is for informational purposes only at this time. However, if information derived from this RFI and budgetary concerns allow, a solicitation of either full implementation of the RFI's evaluated recommendations or a deductive alternate of that recommendation should ensue. This RFI is sought to accumulate the best and latest information with existing, current, or new technologies. The NAICS Code 541512 Size Standard $25.0 million shall apply to this RFI.<br />This RFI should address systems and applications currently in place at OPM-FIS and range from minimal change of technology all the way to complete system revamping allowing for a complete electronic application (to include secured web based solutions) with storage and recovery sufficient to comply with all archiving and destruction procedures required by Agency and Governmental regulations.<br />This RFI will be open from the date of release for 45 calendar days with the possibility after review and evaluation, a new solicitation being release. This RFI is requested of companies currently involved in the market place where these services/products are available.<br />2. SCOPE<br />The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Federal Investigative Services (FIS) is conducting research for an on-line/electronic FOIA/Privacy Act workflow and processing system to support FIS in processing FOIA and Privacy Act requests. The system must be capable of integrating with electronic components of the OPM-FIS EPIC suite of automated systems, and must provide basic functionality for processes performed by FOIA/PA staff.<br />In addition, FIS requires information about support services including but not limited to: project management, system integration and implementation, ongoing system maintenance requirements, help desk support and transition to operations and maintenance.<br />FIS FOIPA RFI Page 2 of 4<br />3.

<DESC>This is not a request for either a quote or proposal, or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this pre-solicitation synopsis is to identify potential offerors for Admiral Clarey Bridge Maintenance and Repair Services, Ford Island, Oahu, HI.  

The Ford Island Bridge Facility is comprised of pile supported viaduct structures, hinged 120 and 250 foot composite steel/Portland cement concrete transition spans and a 930 foot long movable concrete pontoon section at the navigation harbor channel.  The bridges concrete components are constructed of Portland cement with a micro-silica fume additive.  The movable pontoon section retracts back under the raised transition spans to provide a clear opening for the passage of ships.
  The pontoon extends and locks in place with the lowered transition spans to provide vehicle passage across the bridge.  The retraction and extension operation is accomplished automatically by a programmable logic controller, pre-programmed to sequence the hydraulic operated transition span lift cylinders and winch to control the pontoons movement.  A microwave communication system transmits control signals to synchronize the hydraulic operated lift cylinders across the bridge open channel.  

This contract will include preventive maintenance (including bridge operation), service calls, and repairs.  The work will include the bridges viaduct, hinged transition spans, movable pontoon, hydraulic systems (which includes the hydraulic controlled machinery and lift cylinders), microwave communications, integrated bridge control system, pontoon leak detection, closed circuit television, roadway traffic signal and control, fire and intrusion detection, bridge electrical systems, catwalks and landings, and other supporting components necessary to maintain the bridges operational and safety standards.
  The repairs will include service and construction work.  The intent of the construction type of repairs is limited to cosmetic and minor structural repairs.  This contract is not intended to perform major construction work.  

The proposed contract type will be a combination firm fixed-price (FFP) and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDID).  IDIQ work will be issued via the DOD EMALL, a web-based ordering system, using Government purchase cards.  

The NAICS Code for this procurement is 488490 and the annual size standard is $7.0 million.  The contract term will be a base period of one year plus four option years.  

This contract will replace a contract for similar services awarded in 2007 for $243,558.30 FFP and $155,750.00 IDIQ.
  We will include information about the current contract and the incumbent contractor (e.g., value of last option exercised, firm name, address, etc.) with the solicitation package.  We do not require requests under the Freedom of Information Act for this information.  

Interested parties must submit the following information:  (1) Full name and address of the firm and (2) A statement regarding your business size (e.g. 8(a), small business, large business, hubzone) (3) A statement that your firm has similar past performance and experience in terms of the scope and dollar value.  Interested parties may submit their response to shari.lillie@navy.mil.  

This sources sought announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.
  If issued, the solicitation will utilize source selection procedures, which require offerors to submit technical and price proposals.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>"This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>This is strictly market research; therefore no questions regarding this market research will be entertained.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Program Support Center (PSC) is the shared-services provider for the Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS). Created in 1995 to reduce duplication in federal administrative support services, PSC provides support services to the department, its component agencies, and other federal agencies on a competitive fee-for-service basis, allowing the agencies to focus on their core missions. Support services include administrative operations, financial management, human resources, strategic acquisition, and federal occupational health.</p>
<p>The Program Support Center (PSC) at HHS wants to identify viable sources that can establish a Public Reporting Coordinating Center (Center) for the Agency for Healthcare Research &amp; Quality (AHRQ). For the purpose of this Sources Sought document, public reporting refers to any effort to provide a broad audience of health care consumers with information that allows rating or comparison of providers according to certain standards of quality and resource use performance. Public reporting is a process that may involve voluntary or mandatory data collection from a combination of health care providers, plans, payers, and consumers; processing of that data into measures and comparison to standards of quality and resource use; and final dissemination to a public audience. Consumers are any actual or potential recipient of health care services. Providers include any person, organization, or facility directly involved in the delivery of health care services, including, but not limited to, individual or groups of physicians, nurses physician assistants, pharmacists, home health professionals, hospitals, nursing homes, dialysis facilities and pharmacies.</p>
<p>There are numerous public reports from the Federal to the State and local levels, but most have failed to attract a consumer audience due to poor design, irrelevant content, and inadequate dissemination. The Coordinating Center will help facilitate the development of a health care system in which every consumer has ready access to reports that allow meaningful comparison of providers based on measures of quality and resource use.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>This requirement is intended to establish a Public Reporting Coordinating Center (Center) in fiscal year 2013. The objectives of this Center include providing program support, technical assistance, and the translation and dissemination of research; and conducting an evaluation.</p>
<p>The Center's primary role is to serve as a link between public reporting research and producers of public reports, to speed the translation of research into practice. The Center will connect principal investigators of AHRQ-funded public reporting research through annual meetings and more frequent telephone and electronic communication. The Center will also serve as a resource for public report sponsors, policymakers, the media, and health care purchasers and payers, making the latest research results readily available for implementation. As part of this role, the Center will coordinate and communicate with stakeholders active in the public reporting field, including Federal public report producers such as the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, public and private report producers at the national, state, and local levels, and consumer and employer representatives familiar with public reporting initiatives.</p>

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the name and telephone number for a point of contact) to the contract specialist listed in the announcement within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Water Mission Area, Office of Water Quality, National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL) has a requirement to have a gap analysis performed to determine the extent of work and the estimated cost and time needed to upgrade the current Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to the most current version available. The report expected from the gap analysis will provide an estimate of the cost of upgrading to StarLIMS 10 and will be used to determine whether the NWQL should procure a contract for StarLIMS to perform the upgrade to StarLIMS 10 or pursue the purchase of a new LIMS system through open and full competition.
The StarLIMS base commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software was initially purchased from StarLIMS Corporation and has been heavily customized by NWQL programmers to meet continuously changing requirements, which was both allowed and encouraged. At the same time that the NWQL was making these modifications, StarLIMS was also continually updating its base software and eventually released StarLIMS version 10. In order for the NWQL to use StarLIMS version 10, the customizations made over the years at the NWQL needs to be compared to the current functionality available in StarLIMS version 10. The only knowledge available to make this determination resides with StarLIMS, who owns the intellectual property of StarLIMS and who knows what current functionality is available. Three-tier architecture has the following tiers:Presentation tierThis is the topmost level of the application. The presentation tier displays information that needs to be accessed by laboratory users. It communicates with other tiers by outputting results to the graphical user interface or passing information to the relation database management system (RDBMS). When developed by a software vendor, this tier and its associated source code is owned and maintained by the vendor. The NWQL does not have any access to the source code.
Application tier - otherwise known as the business logic, logic tier, data access tier, or middle tierThe logic tier is pulled out from the presentation tier and, as its own layer; it controls an applications functionality by performing detailed processing. This is the tier within StarLIMS that contains all of the custom functionality developed by the NWQL programmers in addition to all of the base functionality originally provided by StarLIMS. This tier now differs significantly from the middle tier that StarLIMS now delivers with StarLIMS 10 version of its software. 
Data tierThis tier consists of database servers. Here information is stored and retrieved. This tier keeps data neutral and independent from application servers or business logic. Giving data its own tier also improves scalability and performance. However, both the presentation tier and the application tier must be designed to interact with the data tier. There are date and tables located within the data tier that are only accessed by the presentation tier and if those tables are not upgraded when the presentation tier is upgraded or if they are modified without maintaining the correct relationship with the presentation tier then the presentation layer will fail and the software will not function properly.
StarLIMS is not unique in using a three-tier architecture. What makes StarLIMS unique for this procurement is that only StarLIMS has the source code for the presentation tier, which is the base tier used to display the application to the user. Any changes made to the presentation tier by StarLIMS could affect both the application tier and the data tier because the table structure and queries used by the presentation layer are unknown to anyone outside of StarLIMS. Therefore, the design, development, maintenance, and support of the software, especially the software used by the presentation tier, remains solely with StarLIMS Corporation.
In order for a firm to meet the requirement put forth in this contract offering, they must have access to the current source code for StarLIMS 10. They must have access to all of the base functionality provided as a COTS product from StarLIMS and sufficient knowledge of how the base functionality works in order to provide a detailed list and description of all functional, operational, and database differences between Version 9 to Version 10, an analysis identifying all areas in StarLIMS version 10 that could replace custom functionality that exists in the current NWQL version 9 applications, a list of differences that cannot be either upgraded or replaced, and a project plan detailing the resources necessary to perform the upgrade, the projected timeline, the cost estimate, and the total man hours needed for each task.
Based on the information at this time, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from StarLIMS Corporation and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response shall include literature, brochures and other such materials which correspond to the required services and supplies stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business February 17, 2012 by 5:00 PM Mountain Standard Time.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>
In preparation for a future procurement, Program Executive Officer, Land Systems is seeking vendors capable of providing Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting Trucks (ARFF).  The Marine Corps is replacing the current fleet of A/S32-P19A Aircraft Crash & Structure Fire Fighting Trucks and is inviting vendors to provide a response to this Sources Sought and invites questions and comments on the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) and Performance Specifications (P-Spec).  Vendors are encouraged to comment on the documentation provided with this RFI and identify areas of concern in the attached SOW and P-Spec. 

It is the Government's intention to procure, via full and open competition, existing commercial vehicles with necessary modifications to meet the requirements identified in the P-Spec.
  While the P-Spec provides the performance requirements for the P-19R the following paragraphs identify areas of particular interest to the Government.

Firefighting Capability:  The P-Spec identifies the required attributes and capabilities of the P-19 Replacement ARFF Vehicle (P-19R).  In normal operational use all fire fighting and rescue efforts must be initiated within five minutes of notification of an incident.  Firefighting apparatus must be able to initiate fire fighting and rescue operations within five minutes of notification from either a designated hotspot or from the supported airfield ARFF facility. 

Transportability:  The P-Spec states the P-19R should be C-17 transportable.
  It is also the Governments desire is to have a vehicle that is similar in size to the current P-19A and weigh no more than 40,000 pounds while still meeting all other requirements of the P-Spec.  Vendors should pay particular attention to the limitations for shipboard and rail transportation in the P-Spec and supporting documentation.  Since it is the Government's desire to procure a modern ARFF vehicle which is similar in size to the existing P-19A it is the vendors responsibility to identify if they are capable of producing a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product that can fulfill the requirements of the P-Spec with little to no modification.

Force Protection (KPP):  While the P-19A Replacement is not currently required to be permanently hardened, the vendor should identify if the attachment of armor to their vehicle is practical and what provisions can be made to facilitate additions of armor in the event it becomes necessary.
  The vendor will not be responsible for the development or attachment of armor but should identify if it is practical for armor to be attached to their vehicle and any potential vehicle performance degradations such as acceleration, speed on grade, braking, and payload capacity.  If armor becomes a requirement in the future it will only be for protection of the crew  not the ARFF equipment  from the effects of conventional weapons and explosive hazards.  The Government estimated weight of the armor package is 5,000 pounds based upon experience armoring cabs of medium and heavy vehicles.  The addition of armor or its affect on the P-19R will not be considered in evaluation or testing of the P-19R.
  Inclusion in this RFI is for research purposes only.

RAM:  Reliability, Availability and Maintainability are key operational aspects of the P-19R.  Vendors must be able to identify if their vehicle systems will be able to achieve the expected level of Material/Operational Availability, Reliability and Maintainability as identified in the P-Spec, based on the specified P-19R operational mission profile. 

Fire Suppression System:  Protection of the crew from vehicle fires is of special interest to the Government.  The P-19A Replacement must meet all current applicable Standard NATO Agreements (STANAG), Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) safety regulations in effect at the time of production.
  (T=O)  In addition to meeting the above safety standards, the P-19R will, at a minimum, incorporate an Automatic Fire Extinguishing System (AFES) to protect the crew.  If available, a system which combines the capabilities of an AFES and a system designed to prevent and extinguish exterior tire fires may be considered for incorporation into in the P-19R  Responses should address the capability for adding such a system to the P-19R candidate vehicle, or identify if such a system is currently commercially offered.

This RFIs intent is to solicit product information and comment from industry.  Prospective vendors are encouraged to comment on the documentation provided with this RFI and identify areas of concern or conflict from their understanding of what is possible in relation to the requirements detailed in the attached SOW and P-Spec.
 

This RFI is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to conduct any follow-on acquisition.  No entitlement to pay of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government use of such information.  Proprietary information submitted in response to this synopsis will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary.

Response Information:
Firms possessing the capabilities to accomplish this requirement are invited to submit the following: company information to include the business size (large business, small business, 8(a) veteran owned small disadvantaged business, etc.); Statement of Capabilities; experience, to include familiarity with military needs and specifications; current GSA or DLA contract information if applicable; production capacities and the ability to meet the Key Performance Paramenter (KPPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs); rough estimated lead times; and Rough Order of Magnitude price.
  

Responses to the RFI should be limited to 30 pages, with an additional 10 pages for questions and comments with regard to the DRAFT Statement of Work and Performance Specification.  All responses should be e-mailed to renee.staton@usmc.mil no later than 5:00 P.M. EDT, Friday, 24 February 2012. No phone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice only.  The NAICS code associated with this requirement is 621511with a size standard of $13.5 million. This Sources Sought Notice is not a request for proposals or quotations. However, any company that feels they can meet the requirements may give written notification to the contract speicialist. Interested persons should provide a capabilities statement and their socioeconomic category.  Questions and Information may be sent to lynn.portman@va.gov. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government. 

Background
The Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center, Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center (MAVERIC CSPCC) is a national program under the Department of Veterans Affairs, Cooperative Studies Program (CSP), that performs administrative, statistical and data management for national and international, multi-center clinical trials.  The MAVERIC CSPCC is conducting a randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical trial, CSP#578, "Prevention of Serious Adverse Events Following Angiography" at 33 Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers nationally.  The study will assess the comparative effectiveness of IV bicarbonate vs. saline and the benefit of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) vs. placebo in preventing clinically important, adverse outcomes in high-risk Veterans undergoing cardiac and non-cardiac angiography.

Synopsis of Requirement
The MAVERIC CSPCC is seeking a central laboratory to perform serum creatinine assays for the US sites participating.  The laboratory will need to use a standardized, isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable method of measuring SCr.  The MAVERIC CSPCC will therefore utilize a central laboratory to measure the pre-procedure study SCr and follow-up SCr values for endpoint ascertainment. 
The central laboratory will be testing the baseline blood sample of each randomized, de-identified subjects to determine the baseline serum creatinine level.  Blood samples will also be taken on all subjects at 96 hours and 90 days following angiography and submitted to the central laboratory.  A repeat (within 30 days) central laboratory blood specimen will be taken on the subset of subjects who show a 50% increase between their baseline and 90 day Scr measurements.  The central laboratory will be required to work with the participating VA medical centers to ensure proper specimen processing, packaging and shipping of specimens.  Results of the creatinine assays will be reported to the appropriate VA site and the MAVERIC CSPCC.  The central laboratory will be required to provide the MAVERIC CSPCC with regular progress reports of specimens received and test results.  To avoid errors related to calibration drift, a subject's three Scr measurements (baseline, 96 hours, 90 days) will be run at the same time; therefore the first two specimens will need to be stored for approximately 90 days.  Following this, the samples do not require further storage unless required for laboratory quality control purposes.
The central laboratory will be responsible for receiving blood specimens from participating VA study sites, performing Scr testing, and providing reports detailing the number of specimens received and tested along with results in an electronic format to be determined, back to the participating VA Medical Center and MAVERIC CSPCC.  It is anticipated that samples will be shipped weekly.  An estimated schedule of the volume of specimens is provided in the Table 1.  
Table 1.  Total Number of Central Laboratory Samples per Year*
Year One (N=3,072)	Year Two (N=3072)	Year Three (N=1536)	Total
9,339	9,339	4,669	23,347
* assumes 40% of the total sample size will be recruited in Years 1 and 2 and 20% in Year 3.  Also assume that 4% of subjects each year will require a repeat Scr measurement at 90 days.
The MAVERIC CSPCC will pay for shipments to the central laboratory by UPS shipping methods.  The central laboratory will be responsible for purchasing return boxes and shipping used boxes they receive from participating sites back to the MAVERIC CSPCC.

Bellsouth Telecommunications, Incorporated, DBA AT&T Southeast is currently providing local telecommunication services throughout the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) Veteran's facilities. Bellsouth Telecommunications, Incorporated, DBA AT&T provides connectivity and switching capability with their equipment for all of TVHS hospitals and clinics.  Region three (3) and Network Contracting Office (NCO) 9 are currently working on a new telecommunications contract under the GSA Region 4 Integrated Telecommunications Services (GRITS) IDIQ Multiple-Award contract, but don't expect to start implementation until later this year.  In the interim, AT&T will have to maintain and install circuits, switches, and servers.  At the present time, AT&T is the only contractor who can provide continuous telecommunications activity and then transition over to the GRITS contract.  Substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements would occur. 

Under the authority FAR Part 6.302-1(a) allows for the procurement of items through other than full and open competition; applicable when the agency's minimum needs may only be satisfied by a service that is unique and available from only one responsible source.  Bellsouth Telecommunications, Incorporated, DBA AT&T Southeast is the only known local source to satisfy this current need.

<a href="mailto:nicole.jensen@us.army.mil">USPFO for Colorado</a>
<DESC>Sole Source Synopsis: USPFO of Colorado intends to award a contract to C West Code Consultants Inc. The award will be made for code review services. This procurement is being made pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) 1 and FAR Part 6.302-1, for other than full and open competition; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. C West has unique capabilities and resources to meet this Colorado National Guard (CONG) requirement to meet mission execution and logistics requirements. C-West served as the Code Consultant for the past 6 years during the entire design process of the Colorado National Guard Regional Training Institute (RTI) facility.  It reviewed each design milestone submittal and is intimately familiar with all of the complex design issues.  It is uniquely qualified, given this background experience, to provide detailed and effective code site inspections for the RTI construction.  Based on this role during design, C-West carries the professional liability of having certified that the design of the facility meets code requirements.  As such, carrying out inspections during the construction of the design to ensure its continued compliance with applicable building codes is a natural extension of services already rendered, much like the Architect-Engineer of record carrying out Supervision, Inspection and Overhead (SIOH) services during construction. There are no other known sources that can provide the services that are unique to this requirement in the required timeframe. All interested sources must respond not later than 17 February 2012, 1000 hours MST. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses should be emailed to Nicole Jensen at Nicole.jensen@us.army.mil. For any additional details please contact Nicole Jensen @ 720-847-8679.

<RESPDATE>030512
<CONTACT>Geneva Emiliani, Contract Specialist, Email geneva.emiliani@socom.mil - Peter T. Coffey, Contracting Officer, Email pete.coffey@socom.mil
<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION:
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. This RFI does not constitute a commitment implied or otherwise that the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) will make any procurements pertaining to this matter. Further, the Government will NOT be responsible for any cost incurred by respondents for furnishing this information.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gain information leading to Government/Industry collaboration for development of U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) technology capabilities and to assist in accelerating the delivery of these capabilities to the warfighter. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Program Executive Officer - Rotary Wing (PEO-RW) invites industry, academia, individuals and labs to submit technology experimentation papers addressing innovative technology capabilities used in austere environments specifically, to provide a laser/light detection and ranging subsystem (LADAR/LIDAR) that will detect physical obstacles and terrain anomalies affecting the safety of SOF rotary wing aircraft in all phases of flight. This LADAR/LIDAR subsystem will be part of a low cost hardware and software system that will provide pilots with enhanced situational awareness enroute to the objective and during take-off / landing in degraded visual environments. This system will integrate into existing Special Operation Forces (SOF) RW platform radar, sensors, multi-function displays, and Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS). After review of the technology experimentation paper submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to demonstrate their capabilities at Camp Roberts, CA in May 2012. This experiment will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging LADAR/LIDAR technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>1. Background: Since 2001, SOF has experienced multiple accidents and numerous combat losses resulting from operations in degraded visual environments (DVE). This has resulted in fatalities, serious injuries and over $211.0M in aircraft accidents documented by the Combat Readiness Center (CRC). The DVE program will develop a hardware and software solution that will provide pilots with enhanced situational awareness enroute to the objective and during take-off / landing in any environment. This solution will also include cable and obstacle detection enroute to the objective and on the landing zone. An airborne light weight LADAR/LIDAR system may be considered part of the potential DVE solution.</p>
<p>2. Experiment Focus: Experiments will be conducted in May 2012 at Camp Roberts, CA to explore the application of emerging technology solutions providing SOF rotary wing with LIDAR/LADAR capabilities. These systems will be required to demonstrate the ability to perform a landing zone assessment with sufficient resolution to maintain the continuity of aircrew situational assessment.</p>
<p>All LIDAR/LADAR system candidates should also approach satisfying the following objective capabilities:<br />a. Operation in GPS-denied environments for up to a 30-minute loss of GPS signal.<br />b. Capable of providing accurate obstacle displays without prior area survey.<br />c. Low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) combination.<br />d. Potential for LADAR hardware integration inside the physical configuration of the AN/ZSQ-2(V) electro optical system.<br />e. Dust rejection algorithms to reject dust returns and to see attenuated objects beyond dust cloud.<br />f. Detect and display obstacles through dust clouds of 3 g/m3 density.<br />Technology to be demonstrated shall be at a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6. Detailed information on TRLs can be found at http://www.dod.mil/ddre/doc/May2005_TRA_2005_DoD.pdf</p>
<p>For this experiment, the systems will be ground based and will operate in a fog/dust environment. Each candidate will have no more than 4 daylight hours to conduct the set-up, demonstration, and teardown of the system. The results assessment criteria are as follows:<br />a. Initial landing zone obstacle detection at 1000 feet range or higher.<br />b. Final landing zone obstacle detection and display at 150 feet range or higher.<br />c. Mapping of terrain and obstacles 2 inches and larger.<br />d. Detect wires/cables of 3/8 inch diameter or smaller.<br />e. Detect 6 inch obstacles and features (crevices, height or width)<br />f. Generate and provide terrain slope information.<br />g. Scan/receive/refresh/record rate fast enough to support pilot's needs in a dynamic landing zone, which could include moving vehicles or personnel within this landing zone. <br />h. Eye-safe spectrum operations.</p>
<p>3. Security Requirements: The submittal process under this RFI is intended to be as streamlined as possible in order to allow the government to leverage technology solutions that are capable of meeting urgent warfighter needs. Vendors shall not submit classified information in the technology experimentation papers.</p>
<p>4. Other Special Requirements: DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS. SUBMIT LADAR/LIDAR EXPERIMENTATION PAPERS ONLY. No contracts will be awarded based solely on this announcement.</p>
<p>C. SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:</p>

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.
If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made based on best value trade-off evaluation of offers, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

INL/LP provides overall program and policy direction for INL bilateral narcotics and anticrime assistance programs at overseas posts by developing and revising drug and crime strategies and coordinating program development with other US agencies.</p>
<p>In addition, INL/LP is responsible for coordinating policy and programs with other United States government (USG) departments and agencies involved in international narcotics control and crime activities, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the Departments of Defense (DOD), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Treasury, and the Agency for International Development (AID).</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this position is to provide an INL Coordinator to the Narcotics Affairs Office (NAO) at the US embassy in San Salvador. The Coordinator will advise on the implementation of bilateral and regional USG and Government of El Salvador (GOES) International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) projects.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities <br />1. Provide senior-level advice and assistance in planning, developing, and administering NAO/GOES citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law programs.</p>
<p>2. Assist the US embassy with institutionalizing GOES law enforcement and justice sector personnel capabilities to become self-sufficient and ensure USG citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law interests are well served.</p>
<p>3. Coordinate the implementation policies and strategies related to citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics. This includes strategic planning, setting priorities, and evaluating bilateral programs.</p>
<p>4. Initiate studies and advise NAO and GOES partners on strategic planning, leadership, management, and organizational requirements and reforms.</p>
<p>5. Coordinate the development of internal control reviews and initiatives across NAO programs for establishing new management and administrative systems and changes required by the increase / decrease of citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law assistance programs.</p>
<p>6. Identify areas for independent, professional evaluations. Design the scope of the evaluations and provide expert guidance to US embassy personnel in contracting for the evaluations.</p>
<p>7. Serve as coordinator for the NAO/GOES agreed-upon actions to improve the efficiency of GOES and NAO operations.</p>
<p>8. Evaluate and identify weaknesses within GOES citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law command relationships. Analyze operational problems at police, military, and judicial headquarters and in the field including areas of operational planning as it relates to logistics, tactical movements, physical security, and intelligence.</p>
<p>9. Assist US embassy on issues related to citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law, with special focus on seeking out synergies and avoiding duplication within the US interagency.</p>
<p>Bilateral Agreements<br />1. Coordinate USG-GOES bilateral agreements on INL-funded citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law and counternarcotics programs; advise negotiators on Letters of Agreement (LOAs) in accordance with INL policies, international agreements, and laws, including the formulation of draft LOAs.</p>
<p>General<br />1. Assist the US embassy NAO in developing citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics strategies and programs, as directed.</p>
<p>2. Coordinate closely with USG Federal law enforcement agencies and, where applicable, US military representatives in El Salvador.</p>
<p>3. Evaluate internal controls to ensure conformance with the myriad of laws and regulations under which the NAO programs are administered.</p>
<p>4. Evaluate management controls, develop innovative program concepts, and train NAO staff to ensure USG provided commodities are utilized effectively. This includes continuous oversight and end-use monitoring to ensure that NAO programs are not subject to waste, fraud, or mismanagement.</p>
<p>5. Continuously evaluate and advises the US embassy on the performance of GOES agencies operating in conjunction with NAO/INL assets and resources to evaluate and recommend the need for training.</p>
<p>6. Provide expert analysis and guidance in project procurement, budget preparation, and program planning.</p>
<p>7. Ensure commodity procurement requirements and the preparation of related project/program documentation support is implemented. Provide advice and coordination in matters pertaining to commodity maintenance and field support.</p>
<p>8. Conduct senior-level field surveys, evaluations, and special studies as directed.</p>
<p>9. Brief executive and legislative branches of the USG and other visiting officials on the status of NAO/INL programs.</p>
<p>10. Reside in San Salvador, El Salvador; travel and work in the field approximately 10% of the time.</p>
<p>Relationships <br />The Coordinator will receive general guidance from the Deputy Chief of Mission, or assigned delegate and report to the Deputy Chief of Mission. As a recognized authority in financial and organizational management programs and issues, the Coordinator will receive only administrative and policy direction concerning overall program priorities and objectives. Specific assignments originate frequently from liaison activities and the Coordinator will negotiate the draft scope and objectives of projects independently with little input / review from the supervisor.</p>
<p>Since the Coordinator is located in San Salvador physically, they will exercise independent judgment in developing new and improved approaches to analyze and review NAO/INL programs in El Salvador.</p>
<p>Guideline <br />1. Guidelines include basic legislation, in particular, Chapter 8 of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, as well as other laws, including other authorities under the FAA, several Narcotics Control Acts, the Narcotics Control Trade Act, the Arms Export Control Act, provisions of DOD authorization acts, provisions of the annual Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Program Appropriations Act (which appropriates funds for the INL programs), other supplemental appropriation laws, and the DOS Basic Authorities Act, also contain provisions relevant to the programs for which INL has responsibility.</p>
<p>2. In addition, broad agency policy statements for the program may include reference to pertinent legislative history. The Coordinator must exercise considerable judgment in interpreting and adapting existing precedents and develop new or improved approaches to analyze controversial and nationally important subjects to persons with conflicting views. The Coordinator is recognized as an expert in the development and interpretation of guidance on financial and organizational management issues.</p>
<p>Complexity <br />&bull; This position involves planning, organizing, and completing financial and organizational analysis of enormous complexity. Due to the high visibility and political sensitivity of the issues that INL and NAO are involved, there is extreme difficulty in identifying the nature of the issues and planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of studies/audits to be undertaken. Difficulty is also encountered in separating the substantive nature of programs or issues into their components and determining the nature and magnitude of programs or issues. Also, in discerning the intent of legislation and policy statements and determining how to translate the intent into program actions.</p>
<p>Scope and effectiveness <br />&bull; The Coordinator performs broad and extensive assignments related to complex administrative/financial programs spanning the full range of citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs in El Salvador, which is of significant interest to the public and to the Congress.</p>
<p>Personal Contacts <br />&bull; The Coordinator works closely with the NAO, US embassy senior management, INL, and with senior managers in other agencies. The Coordinator may also deal with principal and senior management representatives from private sector firms with existing or pending contractual relationships with the DOS, as well as, Congressional staffs. The Coordinator will also be expected to maintain contact with senior officers in the GOES, including within the police, military, and justice sector.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.25in">1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></p>
<p>The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) is a small, independent federal agency established in 1947 to promote collective bargaining, to provide workplace dispute resolution and training programs, and to ensure sound and stable labor-management relationships.&nbsp; FMCS employs a small cadre of experienced labor negotiators and dispute resolution experts to mediate workplace disputes and provide relationship development training.&nbsp; The Agency also provides a critical service to the labor-management community by maintaining a roster of highly qualified, independent labor arbitrators, who the parties may jointly select from lists provided by FMCS to arbitrate their contractual disputes.</p>
<p>Labor arbitrators must meet strict requirements, as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations, to be listed on the FMCS roster.&nbsp; See 29 C.F.R. 1404, <em>et seq</em>.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Agency, through its FMCS Institute for Conflict Management (the "Institute"), instituted a series of courses relating to the fundamentals of becoming a labor arbitrator, as well as courses on arbitration advocacy.&nbsp; The Institute currently offers a core week-long course called "Becoming a Labor Arbitrator." This course is considered essential for those aspiring to become labor arbitrators to develop the experience and acceptability needed to be chosen by the parties to resolve their contractual disputes.&nbsp; In addition, the Institute offers three courses for individuals who present cases to arbitrators.&nbsp; These include: Arbitration for Advocates; Arbitration for Advocates in the Federal Sector; and Evidence and Witness Examination in Arbitration.&nbsp;&nbsp; These courses are designed to train labor advocates and to improve arbitration practice in the public and private sectors.&nbsp; (See Attachment A for course descriptions.)</p>
<p>2.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCOPE OF WORK</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">T</span>he selected contracted instructors shall provide high quality, interactive, and professional instructional services for the Institute's labor arbitrator and labor advocate courses. Multiple awards may be made for each of the four Arbitration courses.</p>
<p>3.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">COURSE MATERIALS</span></p>
<p>FMCS will provide all course material and facilitate all logistical arrangements. FMCS will maintain rights to all materials provided and produced. These materials shall not be reproduced or distributed without the consent of the FMCS.</p>
<p>4.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">TIME AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE</span></p>
<p>The arbitration instructional programs will be held in locations and at times determined by FMCS.&nbsp; Geographic location will vary and location will be selected in FMCS's discretion based on, among other things, cost convenience of the participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</span></p>
<p>The four arbitrator courses will be offered on a revolving basis during the calendar year.&nbsp; The core program, "Becoming a Labor Arbitrator," historically has been offered once each year in the fall months.&nbsp; Enrollment for the core program has increased dramatically and the Institute is considering offering both a spring and fall core program for Fiscal Years 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that no more than five (5) arbitrator courses will be offered during a fiscal year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Becoming a Labor Arbitrator" course will be among those offered, to allow arbitrators to meet FMCS Arbitrator roster program requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented through FAC 2005-55, effective 3 January 2012 and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is issued unrestricted under the NAICS 721110 with a small business size standard of $30M.  <br><br>The Virginia Army National Guard will conduct Yellow Ribbon Post Mobilization Events on weekends during April and May 2012. The attached pricing schedules may be used for pricing or you may use your own pricing schedule.  However, your pricing schedule must clearly annotate pricing or the words "not separately priced" or "no cost" for each requirement identified.  Unit prices shall be inclusive of all applicable service fees.  In anticipation of questions regarding if the government per diem rate is required, the following response is provided:  The solicitation is being issued on a competitive basis.  The rate utilized for purposes of award will be the rate(s) quoted by the offeror(s) determined to offer the lowest technically acceptable price(s).  However, pricing shall not exceed per diem pricing for the locality of the facility.<br><br>A separate performance work statement (PWS) for each event is attached to this synopsis and is hereby made a part of this solicitation and will be made a part of any resulting award.  <br><br>The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition:  <br><br>FAR and DFARS Provisions 52.212-1, 52.212-3 Alt I, 52.252-1, 252.209-7999 and 252.212-7001.  <br><br>FAR Provision 52.212-1 is amended as follows: Delete paragraphs (d) Product Samples.  <br><br>As stated in paragraph (g) of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Provision 52.212-1, included in this solicitation, "The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint." <br><br>Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the government's best interest to accept the proposed alternative. <br><br>Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the potential for multiple awards and the two events will be held on separate weekends.  Since multiple awards will be considered, vendors are not required to quote all services, however, all lodging requirements must be quoted if providing lodging and all conference space and catering services shall be quoted if providing event services.  In determining the most advantageous pricing scenarios, the government will evaluate pricing as follows:  (1) Line items for lodging (attendee rooms, staff rooms and parking will be combined and line items for the event (required event space, to include audio visual and set-up requirements, catering requirements and parking) will be combined.  (2) If it is determined one vendor can meet all requirements (lodging and event) for the event and this vendor offers the overall lowest price, one award will be made to one vendor.  (3) If one vendor is not able to meet all requirements, one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for lodging and one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for the event. (4) An evaluation factor of $500.00 per award will be applied in determining if it is in the government's best interest from an administrative standpoint to make multiple awards. In addition, in considering the most advantageous scenario to the government with regards to the two events being held on two separate weekends, the following will be considered: The thirty (30) day event will be held in April on one of the following weekends: March 30 - April 1, April 13-15 or April 20-22, 2012.  The sixty (60) day event will be held in May on either the weekend of May 4-6 or 18-20, 2012. Vendors are not required to quote on both events.<br><br>To be determined technically acceptable, the following minimum requirements must be met for either area quoted:  <br><br>Group 1 (attendee lodging rooms, staff rooms, parking) (1) The quote must provide for all requirements within the group.  (2) The hotel facility proposed must provide guest informational service (i.e. front desk attendant, concierge service, etc.) 24 hours a day, (3) The hotel facility proposed must have on-site parking, or if off-site, valet services must be provided (4) The hotel facility proposed must be located in the area in or between Richmond, VA and Williamsburg, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64; from the I64/I295/I95 interchange east on I64 to Williamsburg, VA) and (5) The hotel facility proposed must be FEMA approved.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost. For minimum requirements (2), (3), & (4) offeror must provide a fact sheet which addresses each minimum requirement.  The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided to permit a determination to be made as if minimum requirement (4) can be met.  The lodging facility FEMA number must be provided to determine if requirement (5) can be met.  If information to address minimum requirements 2-5 is available on-line, a website address can be provided in lieu of the fact sheet.  <br><br>Group 2 (event space, catering and parking) (1) The quote must provide for all services within the group, (2) The event facility proposed must have on-site parking sufficient for all attendees, and (3) The event facility proposed must be located in the area in or between Richmond, VA and Williamsburg, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64; from the I64/I295/I95 interchange east on I64 to Williamsburg, VA).  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost.  For minimum requirement (2) an information sheet addressing the number of parking spaces available at the event facility must be provided.  For minimum requirement (3), the physical location of the proposed event facility must be provided.<br><br>In order for the event to be advantageous to the government, the lodging and event facilities per area must be located within five (5) miles of each other.  Therefore, a lodging quote only or an event quote only, in which there is no second location (event or lodging facility) quoting, will not be considered for award. As such, event and lodging facilities are encouraged to partner with each other and either one entity quote the entire requirement and enter into a subcontracting arrangement for the portion they are unable to provide or both parties ensure each entity will be quoting separately.<br> <br>FAR provisions 52.212-3, including Alt I and DFARS provision 252.212-7001 shall be completed and returned with your offer.  If your company information is available through Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) so indicate in 52.212-3 and return only that portion of the provision.  <br><br>DFARS provision 252.209-7999 is provided as additional documentation and must be completed and returned with your offer.<br><br>FAR Provision 52.252-1 and FAR Clause 52.252-2:  full text language of provisions and clauses incorporated by reference can be located at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.   <br><br>FAR Clauses 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.232-18, 52.252-2 and DFARS Clauses 252.204-7003 and 252.212-7001.  <br><br>FAR clause 52.212-4 is amended as follows: paragraph (g) (1) change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices and add after paragraph (g) (2) the following: Invoices are to be submitted via Wide Area Workflow (WAWF).

In addition, clauses, 52.222-41, 52.222-42, and 52.222-44 or 52.222-53, included in 52.212-5 may be deemed applicable pending contractor's response to FAR Provision 52.222-52 (included in FAR Provision 52.212-3 Alt I).  <br><br>The following clauses included in 252.212-7001 are applicable: 252.225-7001, 252.232-7003 and 252.247-7023 Alt III.  <br><br>All questions shall be submitted in writing and received prior to 4:00 p.m. ET, February 10, 2012.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br><br>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,<br><br>(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and <br><br>(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br><br>(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br><br>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br><br>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br><br>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br><br>(ii) Examples. <br><br>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br><br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br><br><br>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.<br />(End of Clause)

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br /></p>

CLIN 0003: FM Pro 11 Adv Vla upgrade + 1 yr maintenance 3 each

CLIN 0004: FM Pro 11 Adv Vla + 1 yr maintenance 2 each

This solicitation will result in a firm fixed-price contract. This procurement will be made using the cascading method. The cascading method is specified as follows:

1. Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made using the following cascade order of precedence: 

1.1. In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.14 and PL 109-461, award under this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis first to an eligible Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business (SDVOSB) concern, provided that there is adequate competition among such firms. 

1.2. If there is inadequate competition for award to a SDVOSB concern, award will be made competitively to an eligible Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) concern. 

1.3. If there is inadequate competition for award to a VOSB concern, award will be made competitively to an 8a or HubZone small business concern. 

1.4. If there is inadequate competition for award to an 8a or HubZone concern, award will be made competitively to a small business concern IAW FAR 19.5. 

1.5. If there is inadequate competition for award to a small business concern, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all responsive offers submitted by responsible business concerns. 

2. Adequate competition shall be deemed to exist if- 

2.1 At least two competitive offers are received from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration; and 

2.2. Award will be made at fair market prices as determined in accordance with FAR 19.202-6. No price evaluation adjustments will be made.

3. When there is inadequate competition at any tier, an otherwise competitive offer from a responsible business concern at that tier will be considered with the eligible offers for the next lower tier. For example, only one competitive offer is received from a SDVOSB business. That offer will be included with the offer(s) received from all VOSB businesses. If there is still inadequate competition, the offer from the SDVOSB business will then be included with SB offer(s) received; finally, if there is inadequate competition at the SB tier, the SDVOSB offer will be included with all responsive offers.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">The subject amendment 0001 changes the CLIN structure in order to separate Phase-In services from the Base Period. As a result of the structure change, Section M paragraph 4.4.3 (Previously 9.4.3) language has been modified. This amendment is attached as D v.2 FA2550-11-R-8001 Solicitation Amendment 0001.<br /><br />During&nbsp;review of Section M, it was discovered the Section M numbering was erroneous. The numbering has been corrected to begin with paragraph 1 vs paragraph 6.<br /><br />Additionally, the PWS has been amended to reflect a change to paragraph 3.3. This change updates the Government Furnished Information (GFI). This revised PWS is attached as&nbsp;E v.2 4SES PWS.<br /><br />With respect to the final solicitation, additional questions have been received in regards to six issues and are hereby posted as B v.2 Questions from Industry and Government Responses.</p>

<p>INL's Office of the Americas (INL/LP) develops narcotics control and anticrime policy initiatives for countries in the Western Hemisphere who produce and transit narcotics. INL/LP provides overall program and policy direction for INL bilateral narcotics and anticrime assistance programs at overseas posts by developing and revising drug and crime strategies and coordinating program development with other US agencies.</p>
<p>In addition, INL/LP is responsible for coordinating policy and programs with other United States government (USG) departments and agencies involved in international narcotics control and crime activities, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the Departments of Defense (DOD), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Treasury, and the Agency for International Development (AID).</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this position is to provide an INL Coordinator to the Narcotics Affairs Office (NAO) at the US embassy in San Salvador. The Coordinator will advise on the implementation of bilateral and regional USG and Government of El Salvador (GOES) International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) projects.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities <br />1. Provide senior-level advice and assistance in planning, developing, and administering NAO/GOES citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law programs.</p>
<p>2. Assist the US embassy with institutionalizing GOES law enforcement and justice sector personnel capabilities to become self-sufficient and ensure USG citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law interests are well served.</p>
<p>3. Coordinate the implementation policies and strategies related to citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics. This includes strategic planning, setting priorities, and evaluating bilateral programs.</p>
<p>4. Initiate studies and advise NAO and GOES partners on strategic planning, leadership, management, and organizational requirements and reforms.</p>
<p>5. Coordinate the development of internal control reviews and initiatives across NAO programs for establishing new management and administrative systems and changes required by the increase / decrease of citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law assistance programs.</p>
<p>6. Identify areas for independent, professional evaluations. Design the scope of the evaluations and provide expert guidance to US embassy personnel in contracting for the evaluations.</p>
<p>7. Serve as coordinator for the NAO/GOES agreed-upon actions to improve the efficiency of GOES and NAO operations.</p>
<p>8. Evaluate and identify weaknesses within GOES citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law command relationships. Analyze operational problems at police, military, and judicial headquarters and in the field including areas of operational planning as it relates to logistics, tactical movements, physical security, and intelligence.</p>
<p>9. Assist US embassy on issues related to citizen safety, law enforcement, and rule of law, with special focus on seeking out synergies and avoiding duplication within the US interagency.</p>
<p>Bilateral Agreements<br />1. Coordinate USG-GOES bilateral agreements on INL-funded citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law and counternarcotics programs; advise negotiators on Letters of Agreement (LOAs) in accordance with INL policies, international agreements, and laws, including the formulation of draft LOAs.</p>

<p>2. Coordinate closely with USG Federal law enforcement agencies and, where applicable, US military representatives in El Salvador.</p>
<p>3. Evaluate internal controls to ensure conformance with the myriad of laws and regulations under which the NAO programs are administered.</p>
<p>4. Evaluate management controls, develop innovative program concepts, and train NAO staff to ensure USG provided commodities are utilized effectively. This includes continuous oversight and end-use monitoring to ensure that NAO programs are not subject to waste, fraud, or mismanagement.</p>
<p>5. Continuously evaluate and advises the US embassy on the performance of GOES agencies operating in conjunction with NAO/INL assets and resources to evaluate and recommend the need for training.</p>
<p>6. Provide expert analysis and guidance in project procurement, budget preparation, and program planning.</p>
<p>7. Ensure commodity procurement requirements and the preparation of related project/program documentation support is implemented. Provide advice and coordination in matters pertaining to commodity maintenance and field support.</p>
<p>8. Conduct senior-level field surveys, evaluations, and special studies as directed.</p>
<p>9. Brief executive and legislative branches of the USG and other visiting officials on the status of NAO/INL programs.</p>
<p>10. Reside in San Salvador, El Salvador; travel and work in the field approximately 10% of the time.</p>
<p>Relationships <br />The Coordinator will receive general guidance from the Deputy Chief of Mission, or assigned delegate and report to the Deputy Chief of Mission. As a recognized authority in financial and organizational management programs and issues, the Coordinator will receive only administrative and policy direction concerning overall program priorities and objectives. Specific assignments originate frequently from liaison activities and the Coordinator will negotiate the draft scope and objectives of projects independently with little input / review from the supervisor.</p>
<p>Since the Coordinator is located in San Salvador physically, they will exercise independent judgment in developing new and improved approaches to analyze and review NAO/INL programs in El Salvador.</p>
<p>Guideline <br />1. Guidelines include basic legislation, in particular, Chapter 8 of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, as well as other laws, including other authorities under the FAA, several Narcotics Control Acts, the Narcotics Control Trade Act, the Arms Export Control Act, provisions of DOD authorization acts, provisions of the annual Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Program Appropriations Act (which appropriates funds for the INL programs), other supplemental appropriation laws, and the DOS Basic Authorities Act, also contain provisions relevant to the programs for which INL has responsibility.</p>
<p>2. In addition, broad agency policy statements for the program may include reference to pertinent legislative history. The Coordinator must exercise considerable judgment in interpreting and adapting existing precedents and develop new or improved approaches to analyze controversial and nationally important subjects to persons with conflicting views. The Coordinator is recognized as an expert in the development and interpretation of guidance on financial and organizational management issues.</p>
<p>Complexity <br />&bull; This position involves planning, organizing, and completing financial and organizational analysis of enormous complexity. Due to the high visibility and political sensitivity of the issues that INL and NAO are involved, there is extreme difficulty in identifying the nature of the issues and planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of studies/audits to be undertaken. Difficulty is also encountered in separating the substantive nature of programs or issues into their components and determining the nature and magnitude of programs or issues. Also, in discerning the intent of legislation and policy statements and determining how to translate the intent into program actions.</p>
<p>Scope and effectiveness <br />&bull; The Coordinator performs broad and extensive assignments related to complex administrative/financial programs spanning the full range of citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs in El Salvador, which is of significant interest to the public and to the Congress.</p>
<p>Personal Contacts <br />&bull; The Coordinator works closely with the NAO, US embassy senior management, INL, and with senior managers in other agencies. The Coordinator may also deal with principal and senior management representatives from private sector firms with existing or pending contractual relationships with the DOS, as well as, Congressional staffs. The Coordinator will also be expected to maintain contact with senior officers in the GOES, including within the police, military, and justice sector.</p>
<p>Minimum Qualifications<br />1. US citizenship, with the ability to obtain/maintain DOS Top Secret security and medical clearance.</p>

<DESC>** <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Amendment 01 includes one additional question to the interested parties section of the RFI description.&nbsp; All other information&nbsp;to this Sources Sought Notice originally posted 1 Dec 2011 remains unchanged.</span> **<br /><br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION. The 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) in conjunction with the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland Air Force Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms to perform worldwide and regional Title I, Title II, and other A-E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Construction (MILCON), Military Family Housing (MFH), and Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) programs of interest to the government.</p>
<p>We anticipate multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards and anticipate using NAICS codes 541330. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 541330 is $4.5M. Previous 4P A-E contracts have used NAICS code 562910. The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 562910 is 500 employees. We anticipate awarding approximately 10-20 contracts to large and small businesses. We are contemplating regionalizing contracts for services for CONUS (defined as the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) installations and dedicating suites of small business IDIQ contracts to each region in addition to awarding suites of worldwide contracts. The scope of A-E services (i.e. Title I/II &amp; Other) will be similar for all contracts. However the TYPE of projects/programs (i.e. MILCON, MFH, SRM) is anticipated to differ between the worldwide and regional IDIQ suites.</p>
<p>We anticipate the development of two separate Statements of Work (SOW), one for worldwide IDIQ awards and one for regional IDIQ awards. However for this RFI the attached DRAFT SOW covers all anticipated services and project/program efforts. The attached DRAFT SOW has changed substantially from the current AFCEE 4PA-E08 SOW. Sections 8.0, 13.2 and 14.0 are examples of scope areas that have been significantly revised or updated. Recommend review of entire SOW. All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Time &amp; Materials (T&amp;M) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders, depending on the nature of the requirement. Additionally, we anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with three additional years for performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION. These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace services contained within AFCEE's existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E08) contracts. The ordering period under the 4P A-E08 contracts expire during the Feb - Aug 2013 timeframe. <br />ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF WORLDWIDE SERVICES<br />To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for environmental and traditional MILCON, Military Family Housing (including projects related to Privatized Housing), and SRM projects. The SRM projects will be limited to locations overseas and contingency operations (as defined under 10 USC, 101 (a)(13)). The anticipated services include:</p>
<p>&bull; Title I Services: Title I services are related to a specific construction project and consist of conducting field surveys and investigations to obtain design data and preparing contract plans, specifications, and cost estimates. Title I services may include all aspects of design such as preparation and/or review of contract plans, specifications, scheduling, cost estimates, building commissioning services and preparation of operating and design manuals. Title I efforts also encompass those efforts required to support and develop design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, studies, investigations, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, and operation, monitoring, topographic survey services, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems<br /><br />&bull; Title II Services: Title II services are related to a specific construction project and consist of supervision and inspection of construction. Title II services may include all aspects of construction quality assurance and oversight of environmental and facility construction and renovation projects</p>
<p>&bull; Other A-E Services: These services are design and construction-related services, but are not connected with a specific construction project. The services may consist of developing design criteria, fact finding studies, surveys, investigations, and the performance of environmental projects involving prevention, compliance, and restoration when the services of registered architects or engineers are required. Excluded are services that need not be performed by a registered engineer or architect such as providing design and construction equipment or computer programs.</p>
<p>The A-E services outlined will be performed in support of the following program areas and project types:</p>
<p>&bull; Environmental Restoration: Support the Environmental Restoration mission to identify, investigate, and clean up contamination associated with past Air Force activities as necessary to protect human health and the environment. Major activities supported include A-E support for remedial investigation, remedial design, validation and/or review of long-term maintenance and/or long-term monitoring (LTM) operations, and Remedial Action Operation (RA-O) design and optimization. Interim remedial actions (IRAs) may be infrequently required to reduce or limit an immediate threat to human health or the environment. In addition, support includes technical oversight of environmental programs, laboratory quality assurance assessments, document reviews, and assistance in selecting remediation technologies</p>
<p>&bull; Environmental Conservation and Planning: Support the Environmental Conservation and Planning mission. Major activities supported include A-E support on the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), natural infrastructure assessment and management, environmental management, natural and cultural resource programs, and comprehensive planning programs. In addition, support environmental impact statements, baseline surveys, forestry, wildlife, archeology, Native American consultations, transportation, air space and range management, and noise programs</p>
<p>&bull; Environmental Quality: Support the Environmental Quality mission. Major activities supported include A-E support for compliance and pollution-prevention programs, environmental education and training, sustainable development, environmental management systems, and compliance assessments</p>

<DESC><p>F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) Follow-on Services Sources Sought Notice</p>
<p>Description<br />I. Sources Sought Synopsis: This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted.</p>
<p>a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-16 Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC services contract in April 2012. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award. <br />b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS.<br />c) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Sources Sought Synopsis, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br />d) Background: The F-16 MTCs are currently operating at the following Air Force Bases: Shaw, Misawa, and Spangdahlem. The F-16 MTCs are part of the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) Program. DMO is an operational readiness initiative that networks geographically separated training devices in a real-time synthetic battlefield. It is scalable to provide individual, team, and team-of-teams combat training and mission rehearsal. It is the backbone for the Virtual Flag exercise used for AEF spin-up and the cornerstone of the AF training transformation. The F-16 MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. Currently this capability is provided through a training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end in April 2012.</p>
<p>e) The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, non-personal services contract with a total delivery period of no fewer than one and a half (1.5) years and no more than three (3) years (one base year period with four six month options).</p>
<p>f) All services will be housed in Government facilities and utilized by personnel designated by the government. Government-contracted instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons.</p>
<p>g) Payment for training services under this contract will commence with start of service at each site.</p>
<p>h) The purpose of this SSS is to determine offeror interest in providing F-16 MTC simulation services to the Air Force.</p>
<p>II. Program Requirements:</p>
<p>a) This document specifies the performance requirements for the United States Air Force (USAF) F-16 Block 50 Mission Training Center (MTC) System Services that provide interim training services between the current contract, FA8621-07-D-6272, and the Full-Up F-16 Block 40/42/50/52 System Procurement contract.

<p>F-16 Mission Training Center (MTC) Follow-on Services Sources Sought Notice</p>
<p>Description<br />I. Sources Sought Synopsis: This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted.</p>
<p>a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-16 Mission Training Centers (MTC) following the end of the existing MTC services contract in October 2012. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award. <br />b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS.<br />c) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Sources Sought Synopsis, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br />d) Background: The F-16 MTCs are currently operating at the following Air Force Bases: Shaw, Misawa, and Spangdahlem. The F-16 MTCs are part of the Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) Program. DMO is an operational readiness initiative that networks geographically separated training devices in a real-time synthetic battlefield. It is scalable to provide individual, team, and team-of-teams combat training and mission rehearsal. It is the backbone for the Virtual Flag exercise used for AEF spin-up and the cornerstone of the AF training transformation. The F-16 MTC Integrated Product Team at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is responsible for fielding aircrew training device capability that ensures the trainers maintain concurrency with the aircraft co-located at each base. Currently this capability is provided through a training simulation services contract that meets the Air Force requirements. This contract is programmed to end in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">October 2012</span>.</p>
<p>e) The Government anticipates a FAR Part 15, services contract with a total delivery period of no fewer than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one (1) year</span> and no more than three (3) years (one base year period with four six month options).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">f) ALL CURRENT MTC EQUIPMENT IS CONTRACTOR OWNED, in the required aircraft platform configuration and DMO standards, therefore no equipment will be provided by the Government. Any potential offeror must be able to provide fully operational F-16 units to the Air Force.</span> All services will be housed in Government facilities and utilized by personnel designated by the government. Government-contracted instructors, separate from this acquisition, will use all aspects of the services in preparation for and conduct of lessons.</p>
<p>g) Payment for training services under this contract will commence with start of service at each site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">h) The purpose of this SSS is to determine offeror interest in providing training service support on contractor-owned fully operational F-16 MTC units to the Air Force. </span></p>

The Air Force does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Respondents should not construe this synopsis as a commitment by the Air Force for any purpose.<br /><br />Capabilities package: All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates company capabilities and specifications related to this effort and attached PWS. Suggested areas to address include but are not limited to: An action plan to address the Service Summary Performance Objectives (Section 2 of the PWS), previous history supporting similar efforts, and any concerns or suggestions to improve the draft PWS. A staffing plan is also required to address how the potential Contracor will be capable of offering flexibility in the expertise required in the PWS. The staffing plan should detail how the potential Contractor is capable of staffing based on changing requirements and MTF Workload Estimates as describe in 1.7.9 of the PWS. <br /><br />Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: Nicholas.Engel@wpafb.af.mil in a Microsoft word compatible format or as a PDF, WPAFB email systems will block certain files such as .zip or .exe. .

It is likely that this or another classified deployment will be a requirement of the follow-on contractor. The&nbsp;contractor must have, at day one of contract award, the ability to receive classified deployment information, prepare to negotiate the requirement, and get to the deployed location within the 120 day phase-in timeframe.</span></p>
<p>In regards to Facility Clearances (FCLs), Chapter 2-102 of the NISPOM establishes eligibility requirements a company must meet before it can be processed for an FCL. One requirement is that there has to be a need to access classified information in connection with a legitimate U.S. Government requirement. In the case of the C-21 requirement, access to classified information is not required for a company to SUBMIT A PROPOSAL. The Government is not in a position to remove the requirement to obtain an FCL prior to award because a contractor must have a FCL the day of award in order to carry out the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>Even though there is a requirement to have a FCL prior to award, the Government cannot sponsor any contractors until there is a bona fide need for that contractor to access classified information for this C-21 CLS requirement. Take caution that if another contractor sponsors a company for an FCL for this C-21 effort, there are no guaranteed assurances that DSS will approve the FCL. Defense Security Services (agency responsible to the issuance of FCLs) have informed this agency that the FCL depends on a variety of circumstances such as completion of all FCL required paperwork, the identification of the company Key Management Personnel (KMP) who must obtain personnel clearances to the level of the FCL (if the KMP are uncleared this can take some time), FOCI mitigation, etc.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Questions and Answers<br /></span><span>Additional Questions and Answers are attached to this posting.<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE (1 Dec 11)<br /></strong></span><br />Due to a change in policies and procedures, the lead time to get Base Entry Approval has shortened.

<p>This announcement serves as a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 - Market Research.

<p>It is this agency's intention to do an unrestricted acquisition unless enough qualified small businesses (SBs) are located with serious intentions to propose on our requirement allowing for a set-aside. The 50th Contracting Squadron (50 CONS) reserves the right to determine if a SB set-aside is appropriate. Additionally, we reserve the right to determine if one of the targeted socio-economic programs (HUBZone small business, Small Business Administration (SBA) subcontractors referred to as "8(a)" contractors eligible under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 USC 637(a)), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVO) small business, or Women Owned small business (WOSB) is appropriate for a set-aside based on responses to this notice and other pertinent information gathered by the Contracting Officer (CO).

This RFO Amendment 0001 is hereby issued to:
1) Incorporate Questions and Answers 2) Incorporate a revised SOO3) Incorporate a revised Section L4) Incorporate a Section J Attachment 8 - Acronyms and Definitions
All other provisions, terms, and conditions of the subject RFO remain unchanged.____________________________________________________________________________January 18, 2012

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is issuing this Request for Offer (RFO) for an Enterprise Messaging System (EMS) through a Cloud Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Solution.  This notice is being posted in accordance with the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS), Section 3.2.1.3.11, Public Announcements. 
Description of Required Services:
The FAA's current messaging system is a client-server based solution that uses the IBM Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino product lines. Other DOT organizations use Microsoft Exchange.  Support for the FAA is provided under a ten-year contract, currently operating under negotiated extensions.  In conducting its budget, business case, and requirements analyses, the FAA has determined that the traditional client-server approach to its current messaging system does not meet the need to access any data, anywhere, anytime, using any device, in the most cost effective way.  As a result, the FAA is addressing this challenge with its first entry into the cloud by transitioning to a seamless enterprise-wide commercially available cloud messaging service for approximately 80,000 users (about 60,000 FAA users; 20,000 other DOT users).  This first entry point into the cloud will be carried out through a phased approach to assure smooth transitions from a current infrastructure environment to cloud services.  Other additional services, as described in this SOO, will be considered within this context.
Nature of the Procurement: 
This is a full and open competition in which the FAA will evaluate proposals in accordance with the provisions of Section M of the RFO.  Small Business entities must meet the size standard for the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210, "Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services" with a SBA size standard of $25 million for this solicitation.  The FAA is contemplating award of a single contract for a period of performance of seven years (one year base period and six one-year option periods).  
NAICS Code:
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services with a size standard of $25 Million.
All interested sources are referred to the attached RFO.  All proposals submitted in response to this RFO must be addressed to the attention of John Gamble and Tye White, and reference the RFO Number DTFAWA-11-R-00043.  Proposals must be delivered to the following address:
Federal Aviation AdministrationBuilding 10A, Suite 406	800 Independence Avenue, S.W.Washington, D.C.  20591
The date and time for receipt of proposals is 3:00 p.m., Eastern Time, February 20, 2012 (facsimile and email responses are not permitted).  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals for Submittals.  Proposal submissions must be in accordance with Section L of the SIR/RFO.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined unacceptable.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary.
Questions regarding this RFO must be submitted via email to John Gamble, Contracting Officer, at john.gamble@faa.gov, with c.c. to Tye White at tye.white@faa.gov..  In order to finalize responses and provide to offerors prior to submission of proposals, questions will no longer be accepted after close of business February 13, 2012, 3:00 p.m. Eastern 
The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this RFO.  This is a request for competitive proposals and will result in a contract award.  No collect calls or telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC><strong>THIS PROJECT IS NOW BEING HANDLED BY FEDERAL LANDS HIGHWAY DIVISION.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROJECT, PLEASE CONTACT&nbsp;FEDERAL LANDS HIGHWAY DIVISION&nbsp;(360)619-7520&nbsp;OR E-MAIL&nbsp;wfl.contracts@dot.gov<br /><br /><br />In June of 2010, a storm caused an extremely high flow event in Eagle Creek, washing out the side slopes of the road in 3 areas on Forest Service Road 77: Mileposts 25.7, 26.3, and 28.1. This project is to repair the fill slopes utilizing riprap buttressing, an MSE wall, and placing backfill and aggregate surfacing. Development of the riprap and material sources are also included in this project. Final roadbed width shall generally be <br />16', plus curve or fill widening as designed.
<p>At milepost 25.7 and 26.3, large riprap shall be installed along the toe of the fill slope to stabilize the road and protect the slope during future storm events. This riprap shall be keyed into the streambed approximately 4' below the bottom. Backfill shall be hauled from material sources located on Forest Roads 7015075 or 6700140. Riprap shall be obtained from roadside rock outcrops located adjacent to Forest Road 77. If this material cannot be obtained by traditional ripping techniques (i.e., using an excavator or dozer), then controlled blasting shall be utilized. Drainage ditches along the cut sides shall be constructed to reduce the risk of slope failure in areas where culverts are located.</p>
<p>At milepost 28.1, a mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) wall shall be constructed on the fill side to reestablish road width and stabilize the road. The height of the wall shall be approximately 9 feet with a 9:1 batter at the front. Because the wall shall be constructed, no additional riprap is needed in this location. Backfill material for this location shall be obtained from the material source located on Forest Road 6700140. Guardrail may be required at this location due to the vertical drop-off for user safety.</p>

AWARD INFORMATION: The Government will award one Firm-Fixed-Price contract resulting from this Request for Proposal to the responsible, responsive proposer whose proposal conforms to the solicitation considered to be the best value to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Proposers will be evaluated on Factor 1:  Relevant Experience, Factor 2:  Past Performance, Factor 3: Safety, Factor 4: Technical Approach, Factor 5: Schedule and Coordination, and Price.   It is anticipated that all non-price evaluation factors when combined are approximately equal to price.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; use of tradeoff processes when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest price proposers or other than the highest technically rated proposer; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.
  Proposers should be advised THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.

AMENDMENT 0002
The purpose of this Amendment is to answer industry questions.  

Industry Question 1:
What variant or variants of the SPS-49 will you need support on?  

Government Response:  
There are multiple variants to be supported depending on fleet needs.
   Delivery orders and technical direction letters would show the specific variants should a contract be awarded from this sources sought. 


Industry Question 2:
Which SPQ-9 is referred to? 9A or 9B?  

Government Response:  
The AN/SPQ-9B will be the system supported.  However, just as in the previous response, there may be instances where the AN/SPQ-9A would need to be supported.  Delivery orders and technical direction letters would show the specific variants should a contract be awarded from this sources sought.

As a reminder, the questions and answers above are directly related to market survey-sources sought synopsis N00164-12-R-GR32 which was announced solely for informational, planning purposes, and market research in accordance with FAR Part 10.
  At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.

Questions may be referred to Ms. Lynn Fleetwood via e-mail at elizabeth.fleetwood@navy.mil or telephone (812) 854-1557.

A Brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant and may include properties contaminated by petroleum, controlled substances and mine scarred land.

DRAFT SOW and DRAFT COI CLAUSES are posted on the following website: 
http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/hcsc/brownfield/index.htm
This procurement will be a full and open competition, processed using FAR Part 15.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>

<p>6. All questions regarding this notice or the TABSS procurement shall be directed to the Contracting Officer at TABSS@uscg.mil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />UPDATE 19 (25 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide Amendment 7 and an amended RFP. For additional information, please see below:</p>
<p>(1) The only area amended in the RFP is the hand delivery instructions in Section L-4. Due to the expected high volume of proposals, offerors hand delivering their proposals need to use the loading dock on the T Street Southwest (SW) side of the Jemal Building. Upon arrival at the loading dock area, offerors should go through the brown gate and climb the stairs to enter the building at the loading dock&nbsp;guard desk. Please see the attached map for further information; note that this map is not a part of Amendment 7.</p>
<p>Please also note that the delivery building and address (1900 Half Street SW, Washington, D.C., 20593) are the same as before; only the proposal reception area is being changed.</p>
<p>(2) To reiterate, all proposals are due by 3 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Wednesday, March 2nd, 2011.</p>
<p>All offerors planning to hand deliver proposals before Wednesday, March 2nd, are encouraged to coordinate their proposal deliveries with Nathan Dolezal or with Katherine Powers to ensure proper proposal reception. This coordination can be done via email to Nate.Dolezal@uscg.mil&nbsp;or Katherine.Powers@uscg.mil.</p>
<p>All offerors planning to hand deliver their proposals on Wednesday, March 2nd, are encouraged to plan accordingly due to the aforementioned proposal volume and limited parking at the Jemal Building.</p>
<p>(3) After the government receives the offeror's package, the government will provide a receipt of confirmation. This receipt is provisional pending the package successfully passing the government screening process.</p>
<p>Any offeror who has not received a confirmation receipt or is not in line at the loading dock of the Jemal Building by 3 PM EST will have their proposal considered late.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.<br /><br />UPDATE 18 (17 February 2011)<br /><br />The purpose this update is to provide Amendment 6 and three amended RFP attachments.&nbsp; These documents are located&nbsp;in the lower-right hand side of this page.<br /><br />As described in Amendment 6, the three attachments have been amended as follows: <br /><br />1.) Attachment 3B - A formula error has been fixed.<br /><br />The version of Attachment 3B attached to this amendment shall be used by offerors submitting Domain 2 proposals.<br /><br />2.) Attachment 4 - Typographical errors have been fixed.<br /><br />3.) Attachment 10 - References have been corrected.<br /><br />The RFP and all other RFP attachments are unchanged.<br /><br />Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE 17 (11 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the TABSS Q+A Addendum Matrix. It is located in the lower-right hand side of this page.</p>
<p>The Q+A Addendum Matrix has two parts. The first part consists of questions that were received before the TABSS question due date but were accidentally left off of the original TABSS Q+A Matrix. The second part consists of clarifications regarding certain questions from the original TABSS Q+A Matrix.</p>
<p>The government will accept no further questions. Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix will be updated in the future. In the event of a discrepancy between either matrix and the amended RFP, the amended RFP governs.</p>
<p>Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix are included in any of the TABSS amendments. They are provided as guidance to offerors.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.</p>
<p>UPDATE 16 (10 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the amended RFP and RFP attachments. Of particular note is the amended Attachment 10, "Labor Category Descriptions and Qualifications Matrix," along with the new Attachment 11, "Annual Small Business Subcontracting Compliance Report."</p>
<p>Two copies of the RFP are being provided, an "informational" copy with highlighting and a "conformed" copy without highlighting. In the informational copy, all new changes to the RFP have been highlighted in turquoise. Changes made via Amendment 4 are highlighted in yellow. The content of the two RFPs (both informational and conformed) is identical. Please use the conformed copy in the future.</p>
<p>Attachments that have been changed since Amendment 4 are updated per the descriptions on the Standard Form 30 in Amendment 5. Any attachment not mentioned in the Standard Form 30 in Amendment 5 is unchanged. However, all attachments are included with this update for offerors' reference.</p>
<p>Regarding the amended RFP, to reiterate:</p>
<p>(1) Paper copies of proposals are required. Please see Sections L-5 and L-6 of the amended RFP for more information.</p>
<p>(2) Labor category descriptions are provided in the amended Attachment 10. Offerors should meet those stated requirements</p>
<p>(3) For offerors' acknowledgement of amendments, please see Section L-8 of the RFP.</p>
<p>(4) Evaluation Factor 3, "Socio-economic Considerations," has been significantly amended. Please see Sections L and M of the RFP for more information.</p>
<p>(5) For the $250 contractual minimum, this amount will be obligated to each contract at the time of award. It will not be provided as consideration for the contractor's requirement to attend the post-award conference. Travel expenses for post-award conferences are the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>(6) The proposal due date is extended until 3 PM Eastern Standard Time on 03/02/2011.</p>
<p>With regard to the TABSS email box, it is sporadically experiencing technical difficulties; the government is working to resolve the issue. Offerors should advise all their references to continue sending their past performance questionnaires to TABSS@uscg.mil, but references may also copy Nathan Dolezal (nate.dolezal@uscg.mil) and Katherine Powers (Katherine.Powers@uscg.mil) on emails containing completed questionnaires.</p>

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components.</p>
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>NRMJ0000-12-01041
<AWDDATE>031912
<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a noncompetitive Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract with the University of Maryland GigaPOP (MAX) for the interconnection of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OICO) and NOAA Research facilities in the Washington, DC Metropolitan area to NOAA Research Network or N-WAVE. The noncompetitive contract shall be awarded for one base year of performance with four (4) one year option periods. The Government anticipates that the base period will commence on or about March 18, 2012 through March 17, 2013. The option periods, if exercised, are from March 18, 2013 through March 17, 2017. The total performance of this contract shall not exceed five (5) years.
<p>The NOAA Office of the Chief Information Officer has engineered, configured and implemented a national Wide Area Research Network, also known as N-Wave, for interconnection of the OCIO, NOAA high performance research resources and the NOAA scientific community as a whole. The intent of N-Wave, when fully implemented, is to provide a national network backbone for the interconnection of all NOAA research facilities. Key factors to and the underlying infrastructure of N-Wave are the fiber optic circuits, waves access to national research networks (such as Internet2, National LamdaRail) and the associated services provided by members of the research consortiums. The proposed contract action is a continuation of the current connectivity of the N-Wave in the Mid-Atlantic Region (Washington, DC Metropolitan Area). Specifically, the University of Maryland will be required to perform the following tasks:<br />&bull; Provide connectivity of NOAA's OCIO and Research facilities to the University of Maryland (MAX) core services. Provide the management, design and guidance for capacity and capability expansion of N-Wave. <br />&bull; Provide overarching market research and assessment of emerging networking services and technologies that may enhance the capabilities of the research consortiums and in particular NOAA's high performance research network. <br />&bull; Provide Engineering, technical and management support services to maintain the established networks.</p>
<p>In contracting with the University of Maryland, NOAA leverages substantial research investment as a long standing member of multiple research consortiums. This proposed action will also enforce NOAA's commitment to current and future network access privileges granted through consortium "Indefeasible Right of Use" agreements (IRUs). Finally, NOAA's opportunity to enhance its leadership role in research is sustained through collaboration with Federal agencies labs, nonprofit organizations, universities, libraries and technology and information service providers throughout the United States.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for proposals. It is the Government's belief that the University of Maryland GigaPOP (MAX) is the only entity capable of meeting the requirements in the attached Statement of Work. Any potential sources with the expertise and required capabilities to meet these requirements may demonstrate its ability to meet the requirements stated above by submitting a capabilities statement in duplicate copies not later than 15 calendar days from the date of the posting of this announcement. Any response must include sufficient information to allow the Government to evaluate its capability relative to the technical requirements stated herein. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion. Responses are to be submitted to Contracting Officer, Harry Rippenbuam, at Harry.Rippenbaum@noaa.gov. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.</p>

<DESC><p>The USAID/OTI Kyrgyz Republic Transition Initiative (KRTI) program is designed to enhance U.S. Government (USG) policy goals and complement other ongoing USG programs in the Kyrgyz Republic by addressing drivers of conflict and instability at the national and community levels and enhancing the capacity and capability of the government to meet the needs of its people. USAID/OTI works with disenfranchised communities through small-scale community-driven improvement activities that engage youth and other potentially volatile populations and provide technical assistance to the government to help restore their ability to provide core government functions. KRTI responds to an urgent need from the Kyrgyz Republic national and local governments and the people in offering immediate, tangible community improvement projects and grants to create employment, augment social trust, and decrease violent instability.</p>
<p><br />To quickly and effectively develop and implement activities that meet these policy and programmatic goals, USAID/OTI requires implementing partner support under the SWIFT III IQC platform to establish and manage a quick-response mechanism. USAID/OTI released an RFTOP under the SWIFT III IQC in April 2010, and issued the Task Order (TO) award to the International Resources Group (IRG).</p>
<p>The services required for this extension are the same as the services required in the existing Task Order, currently implemented by IRG. All current and planned program activities fall within the current IRG Scope of Work and do not represent a change in programming. Thus, the end date will be extended and ceiling be increased to accommodate potential new funding in response to on-the-ground needs. The new end date will be December 6, 2012 and the new ceiling will be $34,762,538, an increase of $11,995,326. The proposed increase is well within the maximum total contract ceiling in the SWIFT III IQC and has been approved by DCHA/OTI leadership. The TEC increase is necessary to ensure that there is no gap in DCHA/OTI's critical program in the Kyrgyz Republic.</p>
<p>For a more complete discussion of the rationale for this action, see the fully approved, attached Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC). That document sets forth the facts and rationale justifying an exception to the fair opportunity process in accordance with FAR Part 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C).</p>
