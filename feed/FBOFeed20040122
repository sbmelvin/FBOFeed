618-7 Burial Ground Investigation
As part of the ongoing effort to clean up the U. S. Dept. of Energy’s (DOE) Hanford site in Southeastern Washington State, the environmental restoration contractor (ERC) for the DOE, Bechtel Hanford Inc., (BHI) is seeking qualified business subcontractors to perform field investigation activities.  The activities are associated with investigation of 618-7 waste site in the 300-FF-2 Operable Unit, near Hanford’s 300 Area.  The work is expected to commence in the late spring of 2004, and require 2 to 4 months to complete.  The estimated subcontract value is $200,000 dollars.

The work involves several activities.  The first activity is to prepare a field investigation plan that describes the specific field processes/procedures that will be used to implement a safe, effective, and proven approach to determine the physical and chemical properties of buried Zircaloy and Zircaloy/beryllium alloy lathe turnings contained in drums and surrounding media and thoria contaminated waste within the 618-7 Burial Ground.  The plan will also address an activity to field demonstrate a cost effective and safe treatment process to render potentially ignitable Zircaloy and Zircaloy/beryllium alloy into a stabilized waste form.  The second and third activities will be to safely execute the field implementation plan elements.  The last activity is to document the results of the investigation and prepare a specification describing how to safely remediate (remove), treat and package for disposal, the 618-7 Burial Ground Zircaloy and thoria wastes. The specification will be included in a final remedial action bid package for remediation of the 618-7 Burial Ground.

The subcontractor will be provided a historical research document containing  waste disposal information and geophysical data recently collected at the burial ground, and a sampling and analysis plan, which will describe the sampling requirements. The subcontractor will be expected to provide a full-time on-site site superintendent, a full-time on-site health and safety/IH representative, and a project manager.  The subcontractor will also be expected to have engineering and staff resources available.     

Pre-qualification of suppliers is required.  Go to http://www.bhi-erc.com/Opportunities/DoingBus/90-day.htm to download the Prequalification Questionnaire form.  For more information, contact Pat Jewell, Subcontract Specialist, at ptjewell@bhi-erc.com

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is the Federal agency charged with improving the quality and availability of prevention, treatment, and rehabilitative services in order to reduce illness, death, disability, and cost to society resulting from substance abuse and mental illnesses.  SAMHSA focuses attention, programs, and funding on promoting a life in the community with jobs, homes, and meaningful relationships with family and friends for people with or at risk for mental or substance abuse disorders.   The SAMHSA vision is achieved through an action-oriented, measurable mission of building resilience and facilitating recovery.  

To ensure that SAMHSA’s customers receive the most effective, comprehensive, and cost-efficient information service, SAMHSA has realigned its health information dissemination efforts into a single contract.  In the new contract, both the NCADI and NMHIC identities will be retained.  Both SAMHSA’s NCADI and its NMHIC are highly utilized resources within the substance abuse and mental health fields.  

SAMHSA’s NCADI is the hub of the Federal Government's effort to gather and communicate information about effective prevention, intervention, and treatment policies, programs, and practices as well as an important link to scientific research on substance abuse and mental health issues.  As such, NCADI provides a single point of entry to comprehensive, customer-oriented information services for SAMHSA’s current constituents as well as new audiences.  SAMHSA’s NMHIC is the first point of contact for any U.S. citizen seeking help for a mental health problem from the Federal Government.  NMHIC was established to serve the information and referral needs of users of mental health services and their families, service providers, policy makers, the media, and the general public.  NMHIC will provide information dissemination support to SAMHSA/CMHS programs including: the Emergency Services and Disaster Relief Program, the National Public Information/Education Campaign on Children's Mental Health Services, and the School Violence Prevention Program.

Administered by SAMHSA’s CSAP and CMHS, SAMHSA’s Health Information Network contract will provide prompt, customer-friendly, and cost-effective information services using easily understandable and accessible formats, via a wide range of communication channels, to reach all segments of society.  To achieve the contract’s objectives, the contractor must have a strong and culturally competent management structure (from senior to line managers) as well as be knowledgeable of the complex issues in the mental health and mental illness, substance abuse prevention, intervention, and treatment field, proficient in knowledge dissemination/health communications/ marketing/evaluation strategies, experienced in building collaborative relationships to leverage resources, highly skilled in the use of information technologies for dissemination, skilled in quality assurance implementation,  and proficient in modern warehouse/cost recovery operations.  

The NAICS Code for this solicitation is 516110. This solicitation is Small Business Set-Aside.  The estimated date for issuance of RFP No. 277-04-6091 is scheduled for release approximately November 07, 2003, and proposals are due in the Contracts Office 45 calendar days thereafter. This solicitation may be obtained in either of two ways---by mail or by electronically downloading the file from the SAMHSA Web Site at http://www.samhsa.gov. Files will not be made available on the web site until on or after the estimated issuance date. Once downloaded, if you determine that you have a continuing interest in the RFP, you may write to the Contract Specialist listed below requesting that copies of amendments to the RFP (if any) be sent to you by mail. Amendments will be posted on the website; however, we have no way to ensure, and will therefore assume no responsibility for assuring, that you have downloaded these amendments. Requests for copies of the RFP to be mailed must be made in writing or via facsimile 301-594-0535, and will be honored if received within twenty (20) calendar days after issuance of the RFP. Requests received after this period will be filled on a first-come, first-serve basis until the supply is exhausted; however, there is no assurance that copies requested after the twentieth day will reach the requestor in sufficient time to permit an adequately prepared response. Requests shall be sent to Hildy Pollard, Contract Specialist, OPS, Contracts Management Branch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockwall II Bldg., Ste. 640, Rockville, MD  20857.  WHEN USING SPECIAL OR OVERNIGHT CARRIER SERVICE OR HAND DELIVERY, change the address to:  5515 Security Lane, Ste. 640, Rockville, MD  20852.

The proposed action is for training services and related educational materials to implement VA IHCS Goal Sharing Program.  Training must be  started January 26, 2004 and completed by March 2004 in order for VA IHCS to be ready to implement VISN 11’s Goal Sharing Program April 2004. The  Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the training services and related educational materials due to its educational expertise and geographic location to this medical center.  Failure to begin training in January 2004 would seriously impact this medical center’s ability to successfully support implementation of the Goal Sharing Program as set forth by VISN 11. A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed action is based on the unusual and compelling urgency of this procurement in meeting agency requirements.   This is not a request for competitive quotes but responses received will be considered for future training opportunities.  Information should be submitted to the VA Illiana Health Care System, Attn:  Danguole Weese (04P&C), 1900 East Main St., Danville, Illinois   61832-5198. Phone:  217-554-4540 or FAX 217-554-4553

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to contract with 3M Health Information Systems (HIS) on a sole source basis to provide: software systems maintenance, annual/quarterly updates to the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) Grouper and to complete the complex conversion from the current International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM) to the International Classification of Disease Tenth Revision Procedure Classification System (ICD-10 PCS). (Based on the Conversion Act which indicates the conversion should be adopted by 2007).  These system changes will impact the Medicare Code Editor (MCE) and Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) for the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS).  Under Medicare, payments via PPS are made to participating hospitals for each inpatient discharge based on the related DRGs.  The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) is used for outpatient surgical services, which are based on Ambulatory Payment Classifications (APC).  The Grouper software, which consists of automated classification algorithms that determines DRG assignments based on data elements provided by the hospital, is used to ensure that both inpatient and outpatient Medicare claims are processed systematically, and uniformly.  Under the current contract with 3M, the preliminary research, statistical analysis and documentation on the impact of replacing the ICD-9 CM coding system with the ICD-10 PCS has been delivered in first draft.  To ensure that the over 180 million Medicare claims processed each year, via the PPS using the MCE, the OCE and the DRG is not interrupted, the ICD-10 PCS conversion is required to be timely and error free.

This is not a request for competitive proposals.  See government-wide numbered note 22.  This contract will be awarded for one (1) year plus four (4) successive one (1) year option periods.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United States Air Force to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement for providing 34 man-years of Contractor Engineering and Technical Support (CETS) to the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) for the operation, maintenance and support of their C4I Systems each year for up to three (3) years.  The requirement will be for highly-educated engineers and specialists, who have considerable experience in various aspects of present RSAF Command and Control hardware, software, and communications sub-systems, as well as Tactical Units equipment and systems that are also elements of the RSAF C4I System. The RSAF already have a direct commercial contract for the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the RSAF C4I System.  This FMS requirement is for personnel who have considerable experience in the development, installation and deployment of C4I systems, and planning technology advancements to improve C4I capabilities so they can advise the RSAF in solving the most difficult and challenging problems beyond the expertise and abilities of the day-to-day technicians.  The majority of the positions will be in support of RSAF management in charge of overall maintenance and software development to the RSAF C4I System at the Central Maintenance Facility on Prince Sultan Air Base, at Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia. Several of the positions will be to provide support and assistance to the Director of Electronics, Communications, and Computers and his staff at RSAF Headquarters in Riyadh for planning upgrades and future enhancements to the C4I System.  A total of six (6) of the positions will be located at the six (6) RSAF Command Centers in various regions of the country.  One of the positions is located to provide resident maintenance engineering assistance at the Tactical Unit Center (TUC).  Only contractors with proven experience providing this type of engineering and technical expertise in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be considered, since experience with Saudi Arabian labor laws and living conditions within the Kingdom is essential.  An additional requirement to provide a capability to annually procure within Saudi Arabia up to $4M of spares and repairs for C4I system and RPIE equipment and facilities is being considered for this project.  Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this synopsis.

Summary of project:  The purpose of this source selection is to select a highly qualified construction contractor to provide renovation construction services on an existing Federal Office Building.  The Federal Office Building will be 430,000 gross square foot building located in Omaha, Nebraska and consists of nine (9) stories above grade, a basement, and partial sub-basement below grade plus a mechanical penthouse and small elevator penthouse at the top of the building.  This portion of the renovation will be a ?shell? construction contract which will include site/landscaping work, exterior demolition, exterior construction, some existing structural modifications, shell mechanical, electrical and plumbing, plus interior layout and finish work. Tenant fit out work will be procured under separate contract by GSA.  In compliance with Executive Order 12770, the building is designed and will be constructed entirely with metric dimensions.

Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with hazardous materials involved.  Proposals will include a base bid, and options.

The Government intends to use the ?greatest value concept? in selecting the prime contractor.  The ?greatest value concept? is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors. The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.

Proposals shall be received on or about 12-05-02 at the GSA, Office of Business & Support Services (6ADB), Federal Building, 1500 East Bannister Road, Room 1161, Kansas City, MO 64131-3088..  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFTP.  All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number on the face of the envelope for identification purposes.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52-215-1.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  There will be a short list of technically qualified contractors published in the FedBizOpps on or about 12-13-02.

Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered:  
(1) a technical evaluation factor, and (2) price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance, are:  (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm (50%), (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel (35%), and (3) Management and Technical Approach (15%). The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factor.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price becomes more important.  Joint venture arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependence of the members to provide a quality team.  The Government will evaluate Phase I submissions to establish those firms within the ?competitive range.? Only those firms within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to provide Phase II submissions, consisting of: (1) pricing, (2) Subcontracting Plan, and (3) special competency requirements as specified in the specifications.

Phase II, Specifications (Bidding Documents) and drawings will be available for review at plan rooms at no cost.  The documents may be purchased by full size,  half size, and CD (cost to be determined later).  Cost is non-refundable.  Bidders interested in obtaining the bidding documents will need to make financial arrangements directly with Lane Blueprinting, 1520 Main Street, Kansas City MO 64108, phone 816-221-2500.  The planholders list will be based on those requesting the documents. The bidding documents will be available on or about 8-30-02.   For further information contact Joe York at phone 816-823-4915, or fax 816-926-3571.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Glen Essink at phone 816-823-4904.

Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to negotiate a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon negotiation of an acceptable subcontracting plan.  In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the contractor will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Business concerns, Small Business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic limitative of the Federal Government, the GSA has established for fiscal year 2002 subcontracting goals of: 40% for small business, 8% for small disadvantaged business, 5% for women-owned business, 2.5% for HUB Zone, and 5% for Veteran Owned (may include 3% Service Disabled Veteran Owned).  In support of the agency efforts, firms seeking consideration for this contract should provide maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities.  Offerors must also provide a brief written narrative of outreach efforts made to utilize these small businesses.   Phase Two offerors will be required to submit a subcontracting plan with their price proposals.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.

<SUBJECT>59--Digital Data Recorders
<SOLNBR>N0016704Q0105
<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison 301-227-1123
<DESC>NA The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), intends to issue a sole source procurement action to be awarded for an Indefinite delivery, Indefinite quantity, requirements type contract to Pacific Instruments located 215 Mason Circle, Concord, CA  94520.  These supplies to be provided under this acquisition shall be upgrades of sixteen (16) Digital Data Recorders, the purchase of up to two hundred (200) Digital Data Recorders (Model No. 5871) containing Three (3) each 24-bit, 1Mbyte Memory Channel Cards, Model 5843, and One (1) each 110 VAC Power Supply, (Model  5891), and fifteen (15) Command Encoder, Optic, 12 VDC (Model No. 5883)with 110 VAC Power Supply (Model 5891).  Two additional CLINs shall be included for the repair services of the recorders and technology upgrades to the recorders. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competitio n is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Service Will Satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1).The proposed acquisition will be awarded in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 authority - Test Program For Certain Commercial Items. The use of the authority cited in item 4 above is required as Pacific Instruments was the original supplier of the sixteen (16) recorders that will upgrade under the proposed acquisition. The new recorders to be purchased must be compatible with existing equipment currently being used by the Survivability and Weapons Effects Department, Dynamic Measurements Branch (Code 663). To facilitate data processing and the derivation of transfer functions, it is necessary for the electrical characteristics to be identical for all channels in a particular test. Also, to provide an automated error-free measurement system the so ftware programming commands and data structures must be identical for all channels of the system. The recorder setup software use to configure the recorders is proprietary to Pacific Instruments. Because of project commitments, the department is in the process of extending the recording capability of our Pacific Instruments data acquisition systems currently used to obtain data during the shock testing of operating combatant ships, submarines and test vehicles. The department has developed its entire data acquisition system around these data recorders. The installation and mounting hardware is designed to interface with these recorders.  It would not be cost effective to the Government to dispose of the current system and change to a new unproven system.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. All responsible sources submitting  offers will be cons idered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may express their interests and capabilities by faxing information to the above POC on (301) 227-1847.    (see note #22)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI4046 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-19.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis using simplified acquisition procedures with the Canadian Immunodeficiency Research Collaborative of Toronto, Canada for rare HIV patient samples. These specimens can only be obtained from 0.2 % of the general HIV patient population and the Canadian Immunodeficiency Research Collaborative has a large cohort of these.  Currently, our research is wholly dependent on the use of these specimens.  Many of our experiments require repeated collation of cells from these patients as part of longitudinal analyses.  In addition, given that we cannot obtain the numbers of cells that are necessary to complete our analysis by one visit, it is critical to receive the samples continuously from these patients in order to successfully execute our project.  Sample preparation will include leukopheresis, lymphocyte isolation, in vitro testing and cryopreservation.  This is not a Small-Business Set Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 621511 and the small-business size standard is $11.5 million dollars.  These items will be delivered to a NIAID facility in Bethesda, MD.  This is a fixed-price contract and the FOB terms are “Destination.”  The anticipated period of performance will be 02/15/04 – 09/30/04.  FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order for sampling analysis services with Rutgers University using simplified acquisition procedures.  The period of performance is anticipated to be nine (9) months starting February, 2004.  The heart of the project is documentation in the form of a draft manuscript describing the feasibility of determining spatial and seasonal variations in concentrations of organic components of diesel and gasoline exhaust profiles, and compiling speciated organic PM-2.5 ambient concentration  data suitable for testing and comparing motor vehicle exhaust profiles to evaluate source apportionment model performance.  To accomplish this, it is necessary to sample at multiple locations for at least one year.  Because insufficient time remains for additional field sampling and chemical  analysis, previously collected and analyzed samples must be used.  The following requirements are mandatory for successful completion of the project:  (1) demonstrated success in the chemical analysis of particulate matter samples for organic source markers; (2) a database of existing particulate  matter organic species data from samples that were simultaneously collected at multiple sites within a highly populated metropolitan area; and (3) a database of existing particulate matter organic species data from samples that were continuously collected throughout the year for a period of at  least one year within the last 3 years.  EPA believes that Rutgers University is the only source capable of satisfying the Government's requirements as stated above.  The circumstance permitting soliciting from a single source is FAR 13.106-1, "...contracting officers may solicit from one source if  the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available..."  Interested persons seeking to challenge the sole source justification must present, in writing, clear and convincing evidence of their capability to provide the  requirements within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice.  Any response failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of an RFP will be ignored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed  contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  No RFP/RFQ is available.  Submit responses to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency,  Attention:  Anna Mustard, RTP Procurement Operations Div. (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 15, Subpart 15.201, a draft copy of the performance based statement of work and related questions  are available at www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/pmrcsc/roversight/index.htm .

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Medical Directorate proposes establishing a Laboratory Readiness Contract [similar to current Vendor Managed Inventory contracts (VMI)& Corporate Exigency Contracts (CEC)] for medical/surgical and laboratory ware and supply products.  The Government is soliciting interest from both manufacturers and distributor of Laboratory Clinical/Diagnostics products and medical surgical supplies.  
     Laboratory items range in type from pipettes to reagents and other items used with OEM analyzers.  Multiple awards are anticipated to both manufacturers and distributors for approximately 1400 line items, each identified by the Services as ‘critical’ to support ‘readiness’.  Readiness support not only includes DoD wartime medical materiel requirements, but also humanitarian, emergency relief, contingency operations and other DoD directed response efforts.  By partnering with Industry, DSCP will obtain guaranteed access to ‘safety’ stock or increased stockage levels, that are maintained, managed and rotated with the contractor’s commercial items.  
     The Government pays the contractor a fee for managing the government accessed materiel and all program/contract requirements.  As important, the resulting award will serve as an ordering instrument, providing the capability to order awarded items in support of relief, contingency, or other DoD managed emergency operations worldwide.
     The value of the inventory is estimated at $16 million per year.   
     The SOW allows flexibility for parties to add and delete items in accordance with the Services requirements, as well as industry trends and changing technology.  
     The term of the contract will be one base year with nine, one-year option periods.
     The solicitation, SP0200-04-R-7702, will be posted to the DLA Procurement Gateway on 13 February 2004.  Interested parties can obtain a copy on line by accessing the DLA Procurement Gateway at DLA Procurement Gateway@http://prograte.daps.mil/home.  
From the Gateway homepage, select RFPs from the left-hand sidebar.  Then select the RFP you wish to view.  You must be registered in order to download the RFP.   If you are not registered, please follow the instructions provided.  RFPs are available in a portable document format (PDF).  In order to download and view these documents you will need the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader.  
     Attachments 1, 2 and 3 referenced in the solicitation will not be available on line, via the DLA Procurement Gateway.  To receive a copy of the attachments you must e-mail the Contracting Officer, Helen Connor at helen.connor@dla.mil.

The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate, the utility system(s).  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>030804
<ARCHDATE>05072004
<CONTACT>Katherine Kearney, 7578785703
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), proposes to award a noncommercial Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, entitled, Depot Level Repair of Advanced Composite Structures using Reconfigurable Tooling System (RTS).  T he proposed sole source contractor is 2Phase Technologies, Incorporated, located at 2340 C Walsh Avenue, Santa Clara, California 95051.  The resultant contract will consist of a base contract for 5 years with no options.  Individual task orders will be pro cessed.  The estimated value/ceiling price of the IDIQ contract is $6,000,000.  The minimum order will be $1 million, which will be obligated on the first task order concurrent with award of the master contract.  The period of performance for this program is five (5) years.  This acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sol e source requirements, will be limited to the proposed contractor, 2Phase Technologies.  The objectives of the initial effort will focus on four specific areas to further develop and assess the 2Phase proprietary RTS technology.  1) Create reconfigurable t ooling solutions that are consistent with the geometries and materials of the parts to be repaired, 2) Characterize and optimize reconfigurable state-change materials, 3) Characterize composites repair processes and integrate into reconfigurable tooling co ncepts and 4) Fabricate, repair and characterize representative composite parts. Under the proposed IDIQ contract, we will address the development and concept demonstration of the patented RTS in the depot repair environment.  Currently, RTS has demonstrat ed application only for rapid prototype and limited production run environments.  Based on the results achieved during the initial effort, the Army anticipates additional research to further define, design and prototype composite repair systems which could  be employed at depot level for the maintenance of critical Army vehicles and aircraft. The purpose of this program is to further develop the RTS system, which has the potential to deliver a complete composite repair system that incorporates tool creation and composite curing for rapid repair and replacement of mission critical parts at the depot level.   This technology would be employed at the depot level for the maintenance of critical Army vehicles and aircraft to allow the Army to replace and repair co mposite parts quickly, with greatly reduced tooling and labor cost. 2 Phase Technology has developed and patented for single-sided lay-up and repair of composite material parts, for vacuum thermoforming of thermoplastic material parts, and for open or clos ed molding of liquid polymers.  This patented product is lightweight and is a transportable system that uses a new class of materials that can be reversibly transformed from a liquid-like state to a solid state at room temperature with no change in volume.   2Phase Technologies is the developer and has patented a practical RTS system.    No solicitation documents will be issued.  2Phase Technologies is the only available source, however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respon d to the requirement or submit proposals.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this is 333511.  The size standard is 500.   The contract requirements and subsequent orders will be developed jointly between the Government  and 2Phase Technologies, consistent with alpha contracting procedures and applicable cost principles, clauses, and provisions in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible sou rce may submit a proposal which will be considered. Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, Attn: Ms. Katherine Kearney, Building 401, Fort Eustis, Virgi nia 23604-5577.  Ms. Kearney can be reached at (757) 878-5703.  A determination has been made that performance under the contract will require access to and/or generate technical data the export of which may be restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Ti tle 22, U.s. C., Sec. 2751 et. Seq.) or Executive Order 12470.  Prior to award, the successful firm(s) will be required to provide an Export-controlled DoD data Agreement Certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25.  This certifica tion may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FBA Federal Center Battle Creek, MI  49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572.

<DESC>It is the intent of the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System,(JPATS) to negotiate on a sole source basis, with Bohlke Aviation, St Croix , U. S. Virgin Islands for a firm-fixed-price contract for commercial maintenance and logistics support of a Government owned Beech 99 aircraft. This aircraft will be stationed in St. Croix, U.S.  Virgin  Islands. The intended period of performance for the resulting contract should be February 1, 2004 through September 30, 2004. This aircraft is used to perform JPATS missions of transporting prisoners for its customers, U.S. Marshal Service (USMS) and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE). The JPATS requirement is for maintenance support for the aircraft including daily line maintenance and servicing, scheduled and unscheduled minor maintenance, and operational checks during the period of performance.  The effort requires that the maintenance provider supply properly certificated/licensed mechanics to perform the maintenance.  Contractor will also be required to provide the manpower to perform three 100-hour maintenance events during the period of performance.  Contractor will be responsible for supplying all materials and parts to perform all daily maintenance.  Materials and parts for correction of discrepancies identified during scheduled maintenance events shall be supplied on a cost reimbursable basis. The services are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2. The total dollar amount including this modification will not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. This action is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Capability statements must be received by quotation due date to be considered. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals in writing or via fax at 405-680-3424. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 7 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Answer - Yes the contractor is to properly caulk and seal around all existing window and door frames using a color compatible material with at least a 50 year life expectancy. 2.  Does the successful bidder need to include a handicap door opener for the back lobby entrance door? Answer - Yes.  Contractor is to add a handicap door opener to both the exterior and interior back lobby doors, as well as a HID access pad adjacent to the new handicap door opener. 3.  Should the contractor figure on replacing the exterior lobby (front and rear) doors and mechanisms? Answer - Yes.  The door closure mechanisms are 30 years old and failing. 4.  Can the contractor spec coated or shatter resistant glass? Answer - Yes, but as a separate line item.  It is not to be included in the main bid, unless it is a no cost upgrade.  As long as the contractor addresses all  the needs in the scope of work, any special upgrades can be offered, but only as a completely separate line item. 5.

<DESC>MODIFICATION 0003.  The purpose of this modification is to answer questions received from offerors, and to extend the due date for proposals to 2:00pm, January 28, 2004.   

1.  QUESTION:  Would you accept Adobe Acrobat PDF files, Microsoft (doc) files or rich text files?  Do you have a maximum size for files via email?

ANSWER:  The following file types are acceptable:  Adobe Acrobat PDF files - 5.0 or higher,  Microsoft word – 2000, or rich text files.  The maximum size for files via email are 2 mbs.

2.  QUESTION:  Please clarify the number of copies of the proposals.  In #3 it states 3 copies.  In # 31 it states 6 copies.

ANSWER:  Submit 6 copies (1 original and 5 copies).

3.  QUESTION:  In #9 $677,435.97 was the dollar amount spent over a 5 year period for seminars.  Was travel included in this amount?

ANSWER:  Yes, travel was included in the dollar amount.

4.  QUESTION:  In the previous awards to the three incumbent contractors, was this a multiple award, or were these contractors used over a period of time?  If so, please indicate, which periods of time, each was utilized, and which year each contractor was contracted.

ANSWER:  Yes, the previous award was a multiple award.  Westward Systems, Inc., covered the period 2/19/99 – 9/30/03.  The Ryan Group, Inc., covered the period from 2/19/99 – 9/19/01.   Native American Management Services, Inc., covered the period from 3/16/00 – 9/30/03.
  
5.  QUESTION:  I am inquiry regarding the statement.  The contractor shall use the most current Department of Labor (DOL) Transition Assistance Manuel.  We are taking that for this training you are requesting we contact the Dept. of Labor and request their manual to use.  Or are we to use our own training manual and make sure we cover the topics outline in the Dept. of Labor TAP’s manual?  Could you please clarify the requirement?

ANSWER:  The Transition Relocation Manager who arranges the class is responsible for getting the participants manuals from the Department of Labor (DOL).  The manuals will be at the class location and the instructor is expected to use the most current DOL manual for instruction.

6.  QUESTION:  Can you tell us approximately how many participants will be scheduled to attend per class?

ANSWER:  The maximum number per class is 35.  There is no way to determine exactly how many will be in each class at this point.  This varies based on class location and number of Coast Guard units in the area.  There is a statement in the solicitation that requires the contractor to contact the local Transition Relocation Manager prior to the class and the contractor would be told at that time how many would be in that particular class. 

7.  QUESTION:  Will there spouses be required to attend as well?

ANSWER:   Spouses are encouraged and welcome to attend.  Those that do attend encompass approximately 10%.  Instructional material is expected to be provided for them individually.

8.  QUESTION:  Is the RFP information that was posted on the Febizopps the full RFP?  If not, can you give us the link to access the full RFP?

ANSWER:  Yes.  The RFP information that was posted in Febizopps on December 23, 2003, is the full RFP.

9.  QUESTION:  Can our proposal be emailed to the identified office instead of regular mail?

ANSWER:  Yes.  The proposal must identify each submission separately.

10.  QUESTION:  What is allowable G&A rate and guidelines for Profit/Fee?

ANSWER:  G&A rates are specific to individual companies.  The FAR gives guidance as to what is allowable and unallowable.  Profit/Fee is a management decision.  Profit/Fee is unique to the individual corporation.  Both are subject to a determination of fair and reasonable.     

11.  QUESTION:  Answers to Q3 & Q31 seem contradictory.  Is the answer 3 bound copies or 6?  If e-mailed, are there special instructions as to format?

ANSWER:  Submit 6 copies (1 original and 5 copies).  The proposal must identify each submission separately.

12.  QUESTION:  We cannot locate “10 Step Overview Process” at www.opm.gov

ANSWER:  http://www.usajobs.opm.gov/firsttimers.asp.  This site links to the Federal Job process.

13.  QUESTION:  The RFP noted above dictates that “the contractor shall provide”, among other things, “all supplemental materials” in order to conduct the training, yet there is no indication of the number of expected participants.  Can you provide any clarification on this matter?

ANSWER:  The contractor is expected to contact the Transition Relocation Manager (TRM) holding the class prior to the start of class to determine the number of participants that will be present at that particular training.  There is a statement in the solicitation requiring the contractor to make contact with the local TRM prior to class to discuss other class issues. 

14.  QUESTION:  To clarify, how many copies need to be sent in response to the Preseparation Seminar solicitation?  As one place, the response was three at another the number was six.

ANSWER:  Submit 6 copies (1 original and 5 copies).

15.  QUESTION:  Has the USCG met its goal for the current FY, under PL 106-50, regarding closed bids to service disabled veteran owned companies?  If not, would the solicitation DTCG23-04-R-PPA001 fall in to this category.

ANSWER:  Since this is only the fourth month of FY04, the USCG has not yet met its 3% goal for veteran-owned small businesses.  However, because this solicitation is a small business set-aside, a veteran-owned business has an equal chance of being awarded the contract, thereby adding toward the 3% goal, as does any small business who submits a bid.   

16.  QUESTION:   In what form do you want the amount carried out:  Does it need to be on a per seminar cost or should it be with a minimum amount used for price submission?

ANSWER:  Base it on 10 because the Coast Guard is guaranteeing 10.  The number will likely be more than that, but we do not have any idea what it would be, but it will not be more than 35.  

17.  QUESTION:  My question is regarding a clause that was mentioned in your answers and that pertains to the TAR clause 1252-215-70?  Were can I locate this ref and is this a typo.

ANSWER:  The Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) (48 CFR Chapter 30), supersedes the Transportation Acquisition Regulation (TAR) (48 CFR Chapter 12) previously used by the Coast Guard.  

3052.215-70 Key personnel or facilities.
 
As prescribed in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3015.204-3, insert the following clause:
 
KEY PERSONNEL OR FACILITIES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) The personnel or facilities specified below are considered essential to the work being performed under this contract and may, with the consent of the contracting parties, be changed from time to time during the course of the contract by adding or deleting personnel or facilities, as appropriate. 
(b) Before removing or replacing any of the specified individuals or facilities, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, before the change becomes effective. The Contractor shall submit sufficient information to support the proposed action and to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the potential impact of the change on this contract. The Contractor shall not remove or replace personnel or facilities until the Contracting Officer approves the change. 
The Key Personnel or Facilities under this Contract: (specify key personnel or facilities) 
(End of clause)

<DESC>This is the fourth and final set of questions and answers for the subject RFP. Q: Define "phantom" and "kited" claims. It would seem that "phantom claims" refer to claims that never existed but are being billed/paid for by OPM, but we are not sure what is referred to by "kited claims".  

A:  You are right about the phantom claims - these claims are billed, but no drugs are dispensed.  A kited claim is a claim 
that is billed for the correct drug, but for a higher quantity than was dispensed.  
 
Q: Approximately how many benefit plan definitions do you have? For example, does each BCBS plan manage the OPM coverage 
independently (i.e., is there a different formulary in every state) or do all BCBS plans administer an OPM standard plan? 

A:  All BCBS plans administer an OPM standard plan. 

Q: What is the record length for a Merck/Medco prescription claim? 

A:  There is a single file for the Merck claims that contains about 25 million claim records.  Each claim line is 417 
characters in length. 

Q: Of the 175 million claim records, how many claims are from Merck/Medco? 

A:  25 million. 

Q:  What is the record length for an Advance PCS prescription claim? How long are the claim lines?  (what is the total 
storage space required)? 

A: There are three files of Advance PCS claim data.  Each of these three files contains about 50 million claim records.  Each 
claim line is 417 characters in length.  The storage space required is 98 gigabyte. 

Q: What format is the data in? (flat, DB2, Oracle ...)? 

A: All of the files are flat files and the format for all files is a SAS dataset. 

Q: Are the rules of analysis defined? 

A: No.  

Q: How long will the analysis and claim lines be available to off site review?  (how long do we have to keep the data 
available to you)? 

A: As long as necessary to complete the analysis.  The RFP states that all work required from the vendor should be completed 
within 90 days from the date the contract is awarded. 

Q: When will the issuance of the proposal occur?  (what during the year do you expect the work to begin) 

A: We estimate that the work will begin within the next 90 days. 

Q: What platform will the analysis software be available for?  Will anaylsis be continued on our platform and system or will 
it be moved to yours and if so what type?  

A: Sun Solaris 9 operating system. 

The due date for receipt of proposals is UNCHANGED by this notice modification. Your offer must be received by 3 PM, EST, on January 29, 2004, to be considered.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory,  Propulsion Directorate (AFRL/PRKB ), amends the current announcement for the cost modeling efforts only.  The time/due date for cost modeling proposals ONLY is extended to 14 February 2003 at 1300 local time.   ALL OTHER PROPOSALS under this PRDA are still due on 31 JANUARY 2003 at 1300.  In addition to the requirements in the original announcement, add the following paragraph (d) under SECTION A, 2:   (d)  Cost-Model Area:  Efforts proposed under Cost-Model shall lead to the development, validation, demonstration and transition of advanced technology propulsion system cost estimation capabilities.  This cost estimation capability shall apply to all advanced technology configurations within all VAATE propulsion system classes, and shall apply to the Development Cost, the Production Cost and the Maintenance Cost elements of propulsion system life cycle cost.  Add the following paragraph (d) to SECTION C, 1:  (d)  Proposed cost model technical efforts shall be subject to the following general constraints, where appropriate:  
(1)	The cost model effort is a pervasive technology across the other Focus Areas (Versatile
  Core, Intelligent Engine and Durability), and efforts proposed shall cover one or more of   these general areas:  Development Cost, Production Cost, Maintenance Cost.  
(2)	The cost models must be based on DoD-approved practices for economic and cost analysis and contain reasonable, consistent, and well-documented assumptions and groundrules.
(3)  The cost models must be able to provide estimates of cost and identify cost drivers.
(4)  The cost models must have the capability to vary base-year dollars.
(5)  The cost models must be non-proprietary and generally available to all VAATE Contractors    for use in the VAATE program.
(6)  The cost models must address all Government Notional Baseline Engines in all Engine Classes, as well as the advanced technology Propulsion Systems that meet the VAATE CCI Goal.
(7)  The cost model proposals must contain documentation supporting the intent to enter into either an Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) or subcontracting effort with the VAATE Weapon Systems and Engine contractors for model validation purposes and for support of the cost model development.
(8)  The cost models must have the ability to perform: 
a. cost analysis to the component and sub-assembly level; 
b. direct cost comparisons of technology alternatives; 
c. direct cost comparisons of baseline engine versus VAATE I and II production configuration;
d. ?What-if? trades; 
e. sensitivity analysis; and 
f.  business case analysis for legacy, existing, and future systems.
Add the following paragraph (6) to Section E,  as follows:  6. It is not feasible to compete future delivery orders because each contractor will follow a unique approach and each order will be a logical follow-on effort.  Therefore, subsequent delivery orders will be exempt from Fair Opportunity.  Award of subsequent delivery orders will be based on contractor performance and resource availability. Proposed technology approaches will be presented to the VAATE Corporate Board for evaluation and prioritization and will be consistent with VAATE Steering Committee direction.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

“DEFINITIONAL MISSION” FOR ADVISORY AND ASSISTANCE SERVICES BY NON-GOVERNMENTAL SOURCES FOR BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA”

PROJECT TITLE:  BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEFINITIONAL MISSION

1		SCOPE OF WORK

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed feasibility study or other activities; 

1.3		assess any alternative study or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4		provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues.

2  		DELIVERY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR)to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.3.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing strong competition from foreign companies receiving subsidies and other support from their governments.

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Definitional Mission would investigate potential telecom projects recommended by FCS Bosnia and Herzegovina and identified by USTDA.  These projects include the development of cable TV and rural telephony services; the development and construction of an access network to all residential and commercial telecom customers; and assistance with the privatization of Telecom Serbia and Telecom Bosnia.  In addition, the DM consultant would examine the potential to provide technical assistance as Bosnia and Herzegovina prepares to open the telecom industry to private sector investments in both fixed and mobile services.  

The majority of the projects that the DM would investigate would require the mobilization of funding for important telecom improvements in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
Three state-owned telecom operators currently dominate the telecom sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina: BH Telekom, Telekom Srpske, and HPT Mostar.  These entities provide fixed and mobile telecom services to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The recently adopted Telecommunications Sector Policy document outlines the proposed evolution of the telecommunications sector over the next five years. The principal policy objective is to ensure that the whole population of Bosnia and Herzegovina has access to public-switched voice telephone services at affordable prices and access to the Internet. This objective will be achieved through i) investing in infrastructure and telecommunications technologies based on IP protocols and contemporary platforms; ii) opening the sector to private sector investments in both fixed and mobile services (liberalization); and iii) privatization. 
By the year 2007, it is estimated that the penetration rate (number of phone lines per 100 inhabitants) is expected to reach 30 percent assuming installation of 694,000 new lines and replacement of 241,000 lines. Under this assumption, an investment of about $878 million in the telecom sector would be required.  Major investments include the supply and installation of switching and auxiliary equipment; software for fixed-line telephony; the supply and installation of equipment for mobile telephony, including base stations, power supply, and fiber optics; and consulting services for technical and financial management of the projects.
One of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s goals is to privatize the telecom sector.  Both Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Serb and Muslim/Croat entities respectively, which make up the country Bosnia and Herzegovina) intend to accelerate the modernization of the telecom sector with the help of investors who would supply the necessary funding.  In an effort to expedite this process, the World Bank has created the Bosnian Privatization Technical Assistance Project.  The objective of this program is to assist the state-owned telecom operators by providing assistance in preparing legislation and regulatory frameworks for the divestiture of the utility companies, as well as the sale of the companies to interested investors.  As a result of this program and the changes taking place within the telecom sector, it will be important for the DM consultant to examine USTDA’s role in providing technical assistance with the privatization structure that may prompt commercial opportunities with U.S. vendors.

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The DM would investigate potential civil aviation projects recommended by FCS Bosnia and Herzegovina and identified during meetings that Ned Cabot held with the Bosnian Department of Civil Aviation.  These projects include the development of air traffic services (ATS) facilities, technology and equipment upgrades, and training at the country’s main airports (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Banja Luka, Mostar).  In addition, the DM consultant would examine the potential to provide assistance as Bosnia and Herzegovina prepares a new civil aviation law that holds important regulatory implications regarding the control of Bosnian airspace.      

Bosnia and Herzegovina’s transportation infrastructure, including civil aviation, sustained substantial damage during the Bosnian conflict.  A massive reconstruction program, financed by the international community, is underway including the rehabilitation, rebuilding and reorganization of civil aviation and airports.  

Financing has been provided through the Emergency Transport Reconstruction Project prepared jointly by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank.  The EBRD, European Union (EU) and several donor countries are sharing in the financing of the project.  The EBRD is taking the lead role in financing the rehabilitation of Sarajevo airport.  During this period, air traffic control equipment has been installed and various upgrades to the airport’s physical infrastructure have taken place.  In addition, progress has been achieved during the last year in opening airports in Banja Luka, Mostar and Tuzla.  However, additional infrastructure development and equipment upgrades are still required at many of the airports.

Bosnia’s strengthened commitment to civil aviation has prompted the government to cite specific modernization projects at all airports.  Major investments include the development of an air traffic systems (ATS) facility, improvements in radar, surveillance systems, communications systems, hardware and software at all airports, and the development of new cargo areas and runways at the Banja Luka airport.  The government has also identified the development of an aeronautical fixed telecom network as a priority.  In addition, the government has proposed an aviation strategy that includes a series of pilot programs to further develop standards and procedures for airport staff.

Aside from the infrastructure needs, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to rebuild and develop its civil aviation legal and regulatory framework.  During the recent war, international organizations and their military components took control of Bosnian airspace and the airports.  In 2002, after a number of complex processes, particularly those that emerged after the Kosovo crisis, Bosnia regained sovereignty over a major portion of its airspace.  The overall responsibility for civil aviation is assigned to the newly created Department of Civil Aviation (DCA).  Additionally, progress is being achieved on a new civil aviation law.  As a result of this proposed legislation, it will be important for the DM consultant to examine USTDA’s role in providing technical assistance with legal and regulatory matters, especially as it pertains to the control of airspace.

6		PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND PROFILE

On October 18, 2003, during the APEC Ministerial meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, Secretary of State Powell announced the creation of an ADB counter-terrorism and anti-money-laundering capacity building facility (CTCBF).  The United States pledged $5.4 million from the Departments of State and Treasury, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), to launch the CTCBF.  This initiative will help developing and middle-income APEC member economies by providing them with increased access to technical assistance and training to develop the projects defined in their APEC Counter-terrorism Action Plans.  In addition, it will facilitate ADB lending for important infrastructure and related security projects.  Other international donors have expressed a willingness to contribute funds to this facility, including Japan and Australia.   

The project sponsors, donors and lenders will benefit from the establishment of the facility.  The donor community will be able to better direct scarce resources for the highest priority counter terrorism projects being considered by the ADB for possible loans and grants.  The CTCBF will also give the ADB access to expertise it may need to help with project preparation and appraisal.  The establishment of this facility underscores the importance that the donor community places on projects that support security and trade.  Most importantly, the host-country project sponsors will receive valuable capacity building, training and project preparation assistance to help build a modern infrastructure and secure trading environment.  

USTDA, State and Treasury have agreed to contribute to this initiative.  In FY2004, USTDA would like to target $3 million of its annual appropriation for capacity building activities associated with the CTCBF.  These funds will be targeted for new activities, starting with the needs identified in the APEC Counter-terrorism Action Plans.  State, Treasury and USTDA have each prepared scopes of work showing their commitment and proposed use of funds to support the CTCBF and to assign a representative to the ADB (separate from the Technical Advisor position) with the appropriate coordinating and security experience.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes the fulfillment of Public Law 2319 and is the periodic announcement of a Qualification Requirement, which is available for the repair of the F-16 Advanced Interference Blanker Unit (AIBU), NSN: 5895-01-357-0739WF, part number 5188110-007.  The AIBU is a major component of the F-16 C/D avionics systems. Radar, electronic warfare, navigation and communications depend upon the proper operation of the AIBU to coordinate signal emissions and receptions. If the AIBU should fail, the pilot could not operate the radar, electronic warfare, navigation, and communication systems at the same time.  The item is critical for ensuring reduced vulnerability to threats and increased survivability in a combat operational environment.

Although the F-16 Logistics Operation Division does not have an immediate requirement, this notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.  

Interested parties may request a source qualification statement from Gary Grove, (801) 777-7202, gary.grove@hill.af.mil.  Request any engineering data in support of this synopsis by contacting OO-ALC/LGVED, Sheila Gunn.  The request can be emailed to Sheila.Gunn@hill.af.mil or faxed to (801)-777-9092.

Regional Oversight Contracts

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund Procurement Operations Division in Washington, DC is identifying small, disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone and veteran-owned businesses for possible participation in upcoming requirements for award of follow-on Regional Oversight Contracts (ROCs) in Region1 (Boston, MA), Region 2 (New York, NY), Region 4 (Atlanta, GA) and Region 10 (Seattle, WA). Each region encompasses several states/terrorities. The regional offices encompasses the following states/terrorities: Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.

The ROCs provide technical support to EPA in fulfillment of its responsibilities for oversight and enforcement of both Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) activities at Federal facilities (e.g., Department of Defense and Department of Energy sites) and former Federal facilities, including formerly used defense sites (FUDS) and Formerly Used Site Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) sites.  To a much lesser extent, the ROCs may also be used to provide similar technical support to EPA at non-Federal potentially responsible party (PRP)-lead sites.  The major tasks include:  technical review of documents, meeting support, field activities, data review and other technical support, such as CERCLA site assessment support, remedial investigation/feasibility study (RIFS) support and Post-Record of Decision (ROD) activities.

To aid in the determination of the requirement as a small business set-aside, interested small/disadvantaged/women-owned/HUBZone/veteran-owned businesses must provide complete responses to questions posted on EPA’s website at www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/pmrcsc/roversight/index.htm .

<DESC>USCG Civil Engineering Unit, Juneau, Alaska, is soliciting notification of interest from small business firms, including HUBZone and 8(a), which would be interested in proposing on a Multiple Award Task Order (Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity) Design-Build contract.  The NAICS codes would be within Sub-sectors 236 (Construction of Buildings) and 237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction), with a small business size standard of $28.5 million in average annual receipts over the previous three years.  The procurement may include partial set-aside provisions for eligible HUBZone and 8(a) firms, provided such proposers qualify as acceptable under Phase I.  The procurement would result in the award of up to five (5) separate IDIQ design-build construction contracts primarily for general building type renovation projects, but with some new construction.  Coast Guard facility types are varied, but are predominately housing, office and administrative facilities, aircraft hangars, cutter support team facilities and various types of storage facilities located in marine coastal environments.  The work would be located primarily in south central, southeast and western Alaska, but would not be limited to those areas of the state.  Offerors would be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on best value to the government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Each contract would be for one year with four one-year renewal options.  The total value of all contracts combined would not exceed $50 million over the potential 5-year period.  The minimum guarantee would be $50,000 per contract.  Projects would vary in size from around $100,000 to $3,000,000 with most projects in the $250,000 to $750,000 price range.  The successful offerors would be expected to submit technical and price proposals on future task announcements, which would vary in stage of design completion from conceptual to nearly complete.  Lack of responsiveness to task announcements would result in the government not exercising the renewal option for extending the contract.  Participation in pre-proposal conferences, site visits and proposal preparation for future task orders would be the responsibility of the offeror and would not be directly reimbursable by the Government. Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including lead and asbestos abatement.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  Professionals responsible for stamping drawings, designs, plats, etc. shall be registered in the State of Alaska.  Phase I of the acquisition process would be the narrowing of the competitive field to no more than eight (8) proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I would be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the successful Phase I offerors would submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals would not be considered for an award. The Phase II technical proposal would require preparation of a limited design solution and price proposal for an initial project.   Offer guarantees/bid bonds would be required for the initial project and future task orders.  The best value proposal would be awarded the initial project and an IDIQ design-build contract with renewal options. The other IDIQ contract(s) would be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s).  A minimum guarantee of $50,000 would be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contracts. The minimum guarantee would be payable only if the contractor(s) are awarded no task orders over their total contract term.  Future task orders would be competed among the firms that were awarded an IDIQ, with each task order award based on either "best value" or "lowest price technically acceptable" proposal.  If your firm is an 8(a), HUBZone or other small business and would be interested in this type of contract please submit the name of your firm, point of contact, telephone number and email address to Ron Klaudt at email rklaudt@cgalaska.uscg.mil or Rich Garrison at email rgarrison@cgalaska.uscg.mil by close of business on 30 January 2004.  Please state that your firm is interested in the Multiple Award IDIQ Design-Build contract.  If you have any questions, please contact Ron Klaudt at (907) 463-2414 or Rich Garrison at (907) 463-2415, fax 463-2416.  Once notices of interest are received a determination will be made whether or not to pursue this type of contract.

The Contractor will not release their source code to another party.  In addition, the scanners to be purchased will be fully pre-programmed to be instantly compatible with the existing MP2 database.  Datastream will not program any handheld units purchased elsewhere due to an existing partnership with a third party, who is paid royalties and Datastream cannot violate that arrangement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, however, any received responses must be in writing.  Electronic response is preferred to:   sandra.nixon@dhs.gov.  If an electronic response is not possible, send to the address shown above, ATTN:  Mrs. Sandi Nixon/Bldg. 413.  The responses must be received no later than 02-06-2004, 3:00 PM, EST.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice and other underlying factors is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Mint is planning to award a sole-source contract to SensAble Technologies for a three-dimensional modeling package.  This system is comprised of a software package and an external device; the system enables users to experience 3-D graphics onscreen while they receive tactile feedback through the use of the haptic device attached to the user's workstation.  Instead of using plaster, clay, and rubber to produce coin designs that must then be reproduced and reduced to the correct size for the coin die, this system enables users to produce coin designs on a computer screen, where the images can then be saved and forwarded to a CNC machine, which then creates the coin die.  All images are produces in three dimensions, in real time, and at high fidelity.

If your company can provide these same services, please contact Megan Lavin via e-mail at the U.S. Mint (megan.lavin@usmint.treas.gov).

<SUBJECT>A -- AFRL/MNMF Request for Information
<DESC>The government is soliciting the submission of whitepapers from commercial sources for the following topic.  The whitepapers should provide a description of the company capabilities in the topic area.  Limit length of whitepapers to a maximum of 5 pages.  Send whitepapers to Dr. Alex Cash, AFRL/MNMF, 306 W. Eglin Blvd., Bldg 432, Eglin AFB, FL  32542 or email to cash@eglin.af.mil.  Topic:  The Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory is seeking technical information on novel, compact (< ~5mm x 5mm x 3mm) and inexpensive semiconductor devices to be used as single-shot (sacrificial) turn-on switches for multipoint initiation studies and comparison to off-the-shelf devices.  We are particularly interested in verifying the performance of switches that approach or exceed the technical performance (standoff voltage, single-shot maximum pulse current, turn-on di/dt, size, turn-on time and jitter, voltage-control) of the traditional Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Controlled Thyristor (MCT), while comparing favorably in initial small-lot costs.  We seek brief responses to help identify commercial sources, off-the-shelf devices and particularly technical information on novel semiconductor device developmental efforts that are directed toward a component that is suitable for this single-shot switching application.  This information will be used only for immediate planning purposes and an ongoing analysis of alternatives; it is a request for information and does not constitute a formal request for proposals, nor shall it be construed as a commitment on the part of the government.  Technical points of contact are Dr. Alex Cash, (850) 882-2467, cash@eglin.af.mil or Mr. Ed Wild, (850) 883-0582, edwin.wild@eglin.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- Real-Time Multiplicity Counter and Fission Meter
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE REAL-TIME MULTIPLICITY COUNTER AND FISSION METER


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's real-time multiplicity counter and fission meter.

Scientists at LLNL have invented a digital data acquisition unit that collects data at high rate, and in real-time processes large volumes of data into directly useable forms. 

An approach to identifying when fission occurs is to look for the range of simultaneous neutrons. This simultaneous neutron emission characteristic is unique to fission. LLNL has developed a technique to uniquely determine that detected neutrons are produced by fission.

The standard approach to neutron multiplicity counting is a “shift register” sliding word that is gated and counted repeatedly. Existing techniques depend on large-scale amounts of supplementary information to derive assay quantities.  Software and algorithms have been developed to interpret the new multiplicity data in an absolute, self-contained manner.

Another approach is a list mode data acquisition system. Every pulse is assigned a time fiducial and stored as a word. The volume of data that accumulates is many gigabytes if the objective is nondestructive assay. LLNL’s unit processes the data into small files in real-time, reducing the significant time that it takes to analyze gigabytes of list mode data.

Government and commercial uses for this technology include nondestructive assay of assemblies containing nuclear material to obtain massive multiplicity of the special nuclear materials.  Some examples of uses include inspection of packed cargo containers and trucks.

LLNL is in the process of patenting this invention.  In the meantime, LLNL is seeking industrial partners to commercialize the invention. 

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's real-time multiplicity counter should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology including any experience in analyzing nuclear materials.  Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 63-04.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's subject title.
