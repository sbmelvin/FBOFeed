<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet this requirement. Princeton Microwave Technology, Inc. is the only known manufacturer of an amplifier in this specific frequency range with the needed high power that is compatible and interoperable with the Government's previously developed RF front end for the data link. This KA Band amplifier is unique to Princeton Microwave and they are the only known source that will satisfy the needs of Government's experiment. If this system is not procured from Princeton Microwave, there will be significant technical capability degradation to the Government's experimental requirement and future experiments, potentially causing flawed results and the inability to meet program milestones. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirement. <br /><br /><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action and NOT a request for competitive proposals.

In accordance with FAR 5.207 (c) (15) (ii); all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Services - Region 7, intends to issue a solicitation for a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to provide information technology (IT) and engineering-based efforts to support the 502d Trainer Development Squadron (502 TDS).&nbsp; &nbsp; 502 TDS is part of the 502d Air Base Wing (502 ABW) which is headquartered at JBSA Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas. The 502 TDS' mission is to deliver and maintain IT based simulation and training systems for its customers. Functioning as a Government Owned Government Operated (GOGO) organization under the direction of Headquarters Air Education and Training Command (AETC), the 502 TDS responds to internal and external Department of Defense (DoD) customers to meet their requirements in support of Technical/Operational Qualification and Continuation Training.
<p>502 TDS researches, designs, develops, fabricates, and maintains the systems it produces. These systems currently support DoD flying, ground, sea and technical training, as well as current and future systems (prototyping, proof of concept, low rate production) which are either already in service or destined to support client agency activities.</p>
<p>The products range from simple classroom training aids to static trainers with moving parts, no power requirements, to powered mockup procedures trainers and other flight, ground and technical training devices, which replicate actual system operation and are able to respond to instructor induced malfunctions and student inputs.</p>
<p>The 502 TDS also provides notable engineering services and support for DoD Multi-Platform Simulation/Training Devices and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs, including the procurement, fabrication, integration, testing, and delivery of intermediate-level test and simulation equipment and ancillary equipment.</p>
<p>The 502 TDS tailors trainers for its intended purpose and the 502 TDS routinely uses low-cost, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), and/or military specification parts that have a proven reliability and availability.</p>
<p>The primary place of performance for development and integration will be at the Contractor's facilities. However, installation and testing may be on site at multiple Government locations in CONUS and OCONUS. Specific places of performance will be defined in each of the individual task orders.</p>
<p>This information in this announcement serves as the pre-solicitation notice. Solicitation number is ID07180011. This is a non-personal, commercial services requirement. The multiple award IDIQ will consist of a five (5) year ordering period. Performance is expected to begin March 12, 2019. Actual performance start and end dates will be specified on the contract line item structure at time of award. The applicable NAICS is 541512. To be eligible for award, the contractor shall have this NAICS on their sam.gov registration. The size standard associated with NAICS 541512 is $27.5M, which means that a company, including its affiliates, would be considered a "small business" if their average annual earnings does not exceed $27.5M for each of the pay periods for the preceding completed twelve (12) calendar months. The Product Service Code is R425.</p>
<p>This requirement is being competed on an unrestricted basis and will be evaluated under a two phase process. The Phase One Request for Proposal (RFP) is tentatively scheduled to be released on or about September 21, 2018 and will remain open for 30 days. Successful offerors in Phase One will be invited to participate in Phase Two. All interested offerors must submit and upload Phase One proposals to GSA's IT-Solutions Shop (ITSS) web-based order processing system. Phase Two proposals, if invited to participate, shall be uploaded into GSA's ITSS web-based order processing system as well. Interested offerors must register in ITSS. The ITSS Help Desk number is 1-877-472-4877. ITSS webpage is https://web.itss.gsa.gov/Login. Before submitting a Phase One proposal for consideration, all interested offerors must send GSA an email identifying (1) offeror's name, and (2) the name of an individual employee who will act as the offeror's GSA point of contact (POC) for this requirement that is "registered in ITSS." OFFERORS MUST IDENTIFY THE COMPANY NAME AND THE POC'S NAME EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS IN ITSS. "Registered in ITSS" or "Registration in ITSS" means an offeror is successfully registered in ITSS such that the Government can select the offeror's designated POC in ITSS to receive the RFP, view an order, and be able to submit a proposal. Some offerors have multiple company divisions and employees registered in ITSS making it difficult for GSA selection. Therefore, to ensure that all interested offerors have successfully registered in ITSS and are able to submit a Phase One proposal, submission of the above ITSS offeror information (offeror's name and POC) is required five (5) business days prior to Phase One RFP closing date . An email must be sent to erin.quinn-neuendorf@gsa.gov.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date, and there shall be no legal liability on the part of the Government, to include liability for contractor's proposal costs.</p>

The solicitation is available by opening the NASA Research Opportunities homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/, selecting "Solicitations," then selecting "Open Solicitations," and, finally, selecting the solicitation number "NSTRF19".</p>
<p>NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) seeks to sponsor U.S. citizen, U.S. national and permanent resident graduate student research that has significant potential to contribute to NASA's goal of creating innovative new space technologies for our Nation's science, exploration, and economic future.<br /><br />This call for graduate student research proposals, titled NASA Space Technology Research Fellowships (NSTRF) - Fall 2019 (NSTRF19), solicits proposals from individuals pursuing or planning to pursue master's or doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees in relevant space technology disciplines at accredited U.S. universities (see solicitation for complete eligibility requirements). Recipients, referred to as NASA Space Technology Research Fellows, will perform innovative space technology research and will improve America's technological competitiveness by providing the Nation with a pipeline of innovative space technologies.</p>
<p>NASA Space Technology Research Fellows will perform research at their respective campuses and at NASA Centers. In addition to his or her faculty advisor, each Fellow will be matched with a technically relevant and community-engaged NASA researcher who will serve as the research collaborator on the award. Through this collaboration, graduate students will be able to take advantage of broader and/or deeper space technology research opportunities directly related to their academic and career objectives, acquire a more detailed understanding of the potential end applications of their space technology efforts, and directly disseminate their research results within the NASA community.</p>
<p>Awards resulting from this competitive selection will be made in the form of grants to accredited U.S. universities. This solicitation has two phases. Phase A is the proposal submission by the current or prospective graduate student. For the student who is selected in Phase A, the accredited U.S. university where the student will be enrolled for the fall 2019 term as a full-time graduate student must submit a Phase B proposal; a complete Phase B proposal submission will result in a grant award.</p>
<p>The financial and programmatic support for NSTRF comes from STMD. These awards are a component of the Space Technology Research Grants Program which engages the entire spectrum of academic researchers, including graduate students. Awards resulting from this solicitation are planned to coincide with the start of the 2019 academic year and are subject to the availability of appropriated funds.</p>
<p>This solicitation covers only new proposals; renewal proposals are handled separately.</p>
<p>All Phase A proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES and are due by 6 PM ET on November 1, 2018. Detailed submission instructions are provided under "Other Documents" on the NSPIRES webpage associated with the NSTRF19 solicitation. Potential proposers are urged to access the NSPIRES electronic proposal system well in advance of the proposal due date to register with NSPIRES, familiarize themselves with its structure, and to enter the requested information.</p>
<p>Comments and questions may be addressed by e-mail to the Space Technology Research Grants Program Executive, Claudia Meyer, at hq-nstrf-call@mail.nasa.gov. Responses to inquiries will be answered by e-mail and may also be included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document located on the NSPIRES page associated with the solicitation; anonymity of individuals/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Research and Development Center-Geospatial Research Laboratory (ERDC-GRL) has a requirement for continued operations research, development, enhancement, operational capability demonstration and training of the Sage geospatial tools, and intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Michael Rainey and Associates, LLC (MRA) upon the basis of the authority provided at FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p><br />Sage is a suite of geospatial tools that were originally developed by ERDC-GRL researchers from fiscal year 2011 through 2014. It has been transitioned to the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) for use on their geospatial workstations and multi-function workstations. The Sage geo-analytics are based on Army doctrine and allow users at all levels to analyze terrain and weather impacts to create Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB) products in support of mission planning. Sage geo-analytics are a complex set of technical models designed by integrating principles of physical science with mathematical functions to support Army Doctrine built into a graphical user interface.</p>
<p>The general scope of this firm fixed-price contract entails the utilization of Sage subject matter expertise to produce technical documentation, conduct technical exchange meetings, design and produce tactical decision aids, conduct operational assessments, prepare instructional material, and provide instructional sessions in support of the Sage system and in response to emerging soldier requirements. In order to execute this work, a Top Secret Level Security Clearance is required.</p>
<p>ERDC-GRL intends to sole-source this requirement to Michael Rainey and Associates, LLC (MRA). MRA possesses the unique intellectual capital to provide the highly specialized services required to meet the Government scope of work. MRA's ability to link geospatial analytical processes to planning considerations for logical decision-making enables MRA to design and develop Soldier centric geo-informed decision aids as well as implement a unique training methodology for terrain-based mission planning. Below is a detailed rationale to support the decision to sole source:<br /><br />a) MRA has developed a unique and innovative training concept that applies the theory of Andragogy (Adult Learning Theory) specifically to the Army Doctrine Publication (ADP) 7-0, Training Units and Developing Leaders, in order to develop competent, confident, agile, and adaptive leaders.<br /><br />b) MRA has developed a unique and ground-breaking approach that incorporates the use of commercially designed geographic information systems in order to provide combatant commands from Theater to Small Unit Level a more thorough understanding of the operational environment. <br /><br />c) MRA possesses the unique intellectual capital to link the geospatial analytical processes to the planning considerations for logical decision-making specific to Army mission requirements in the design and development of geospatially based tactical decision aids. <br /><br />d) MRA has pioneered the employment of Applied Systems Design and Decision Making, Value Focused Thinking, and Multi-Objective Decision Analysis in the production, operation, and assessment of computer aided algorithms with specific features essential for the execution of Mission Analysis (MA) and Course of Action (COA) Development within the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).<br /><br />e )MRA has developed the intellectual capital for geospatially based tactical decision aids specifically designed for US Army doctrinal Health Service Support planning. This unique capability provides medical planners with relevant and actionable terrain based decision support tools that enable direction, management, and/or coordination of assigned medical forces, assets, and resources in the accomplishment of assigned missions.<br /><br />f) MRA has developed the intellectual capital to conduct systematic design of experiments within US Army operational units acceptance testing that assess the relationships between contributing factors that affect the process being evaluated and the output of that respective process.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY<br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL<br />THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The United States Army Project Lead Network Enablers (PL Net E), Product Lead COMSEC (PdL COMSEC) is seeking information on how an interested contractor would manufacture the Army's Next Generation Load Device-Medium (NGLD-M) from a Government provided Technical Data Package (TDP). This effort will also include services such as: engineering, acquisition, logistics and sustainment. The NGLD-M will be a National Security Agency (NSA)-certified cryptographic key loader device that replaces current load devices and provides modern Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) capabilities.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is subject to the provisions of FAR 52.215-3, and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor is it a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Solicitations are not available at this time; Requests for Solicitations will not receive a response. This RFI does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will the United States Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided. Furthermore, the Army is not seeking proposals at this time nor will the United States Government accept any unsolicited proposals.

If a solicitation is released, solicitations will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. Potential offerors have the responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for additional information or opportunities pertaining to the NGLD-M requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>PL Net E is fulfilling the Army's requirement for Next Generation Load Device (NGLD) Family Capabilities Production Document (CPD) requirements. The Army intends to replace the current Simple Key Loader (SKL) device with the NGLD-M device due to obsolescence issues related to the cryptographic engine and the addition of KMI capabilities. The United States Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) is currently developing the Reprogrammable Single Chip Universal Encryptor (RESCUE) which will provide KMI capabilities and modernize various capabilities for a number of other Army cryptographic devices. PdL COMSEC is developing the KMI functionality and modernizing the cryptographic device via an implementation of the RESCUE, that when combined with Ethernet functionality, comprise the NGLD-M. The NGLD-M will be a NSA Type 1 certified fill device capable of receiving key and mission data from Army Key Management Infrastructure (AKMI) Tier 0 through Tier 3, as well as from the NSA Key Management Infrastructure (KMI). The NGLD-M will also be capable of interfacing with the Management Client (MGC), Delivery Only Client (DOC), and specific Mission Planning Management Support Systems (MPMSS). The NGLD-M will be a KMI-Aware and Product Delivery Enclave-Enabled (PDE-Enabled) device capable of connecting and receiving key material, applications, and other KMI products.</p>

Statement of Work
**Please submit request to RAC, SAO East**
I.  Intent 
This is a request for proposal by NCO 02 to solicit proposals from qualified vendors to purchase an MRI-safe eye tracker system for use in the 3T MRI Scanner in suite GD-200 of the JJPVAMC, with the ability to be transported to the MIRECC Lab, room GC-03A. It is needed to monitor eye movements during fMRI tasks and behavioral experiments. We would like to purchase SR Research s  EyeLink  system: to our knowledge, no other product meets our system requirements; and SR Research is the sole source manufacturer and distributor of  EyeLink.  SR Research s  EyeLink  equipment is MRI safe, state-of-the-art, and is used at our academic affiliate, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We have VA IRB approval to use this equipment at Mount Sinai and the JJPVAMC. 

II. Scope of Service 
We request that a contract be set up with the vendor  SR Research Ltd  to purchase the equipment in the attached quote using funds from Project ID: MHBA-014-16S, Project Title:  Neurobiology of Affective Instability in Veterans at Low and High Risk for Suicide  (PI: Hazlett, E). 

III. System Requirements 
To our knowledge, only SR Research s EyeLink meets the below system requirements
See p.2 for sole source letter from SR Research, stating they are sole distributor & manufacturer of EyeLink
Eye-tracking Camera + 2 Host PCs

An MRI-safe video-based eye-tracking camera is needed, with a sample rate of 2000 Hz, accuracy down to 0.15 degrees, resolution down to 0.01 degrees, and real-time data access of 1.4 msec. Must output X, Y, and pupil size data. 
2 PCs are needed that can interface with the camera using gigabit Ethernet. The PCs must run a custom real-time operating system and have a specialized Ethernet hardware to be compatible with that operating system. 2 PCs are needed, one for the MRI suite, and one for the behavioral laboratory. With a desktop mount, the PC must weigh 2.1 kg, with dimensions 29 X 18 X 9 cm.
Camera Mounts
A long-range mount is needed for the MRI suite, allowing eye-to-camera distances of 60-150 cm
A desktop mount and head support is needed for the behavioral laboratory setting. This mount must be easy to transport, require no electronics near the participant s head, support binocular or monocular eye tracking, and boast a configurable 32 x 25 degree trackable range. 
Battery Box 
MRI-safe batteries needed to power the eye-tracker inside the MR room. The battery box must be a lead-acid battery system that is MR-conditional and compatible with the eye-tracker. It must use two LEMO connectors to the camera and illuminator as output.
Software: Experiment builder
We require an experiment delivery system designed to assist in creating eye tracking paradigms.  
Must be cross-platform compatible for Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and have millisecond precise timing of video, audio, TTL and response devices. Must allow for manipulation of text, image, and video clips, as well as drawing of text and graphical objects. Must integrate seamlessly with data visualization software. 
Software: Data Viewer
We require a system that quickly visualizes data and allows for the creation of data reports that are formatted to statistical analysis programs.  
Must be able to show a movie of the trial with eye movements overlaid, to superimpose saccade and fixation scan-path information over an image, and to visualize eye data over time. Must support both static and dynamic interest areas, and generate static and dynamic heat maps for selected trials or groups of trials. Must be able to output eye sample, fixation, saccade, interest area, or trial-based reports for statistical analysis, as well as output time series reports. Must seamlessly integrate with the experiment builder.

<CONTACT>Stumpf, Lora L.
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Advanced Measurement Technology (AMETEK) (ORTEC brand products), to purchase an ORTEC Positron Lifetime Picosecond Timing System.  This is considered a sole source to AMETEK because, to the best of the NETL's knowledge, based on market research conducted AMETEK is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and sole source distributor/provider of the ORTEC Positron Lifetime Picosecond Timing System and therefore, the only known source that can provide this exact item.  The ORTEC Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) system will be used by NETL to test predictions of quantum theory with regard to the differences between electron and positron interactions with matter.  The features of the PALS are needed by NETL since the research testing is going to characterize the nono scale free volume of polymeric membranes produced.  PALS will also be used to probe the size of molecular free volumes at a wide range of temperatures, allowing the identification of important phase transitions which occur in molecular materials.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement.  
 
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 4:30 PM ET on September 21, 2018.  Responses must be submitted in writing to the purchasing agent, Lora Stumpf, via email at stumpf@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received. 
 
A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT<br />NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, in support of the National Weather Service (NWS) is conducting market research to identify potential vendors to: (1) develop and implement design modifications to an existing rotary joint design, or (2) propose a modification of another existing design to meet WSR-88D requirements.</p>
<p>The current azimuth rotary joint design was introduced as part of the implementation of the dual polarized radar modification on all 160 WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radars operated by the NWS, DOD, and FAA. The current rotary joint design does not meet WSR-88D specifications for performance or reliability. Rotary joint failure symptoms/causes include missing wedges of data associated with its IF channels (Ch.3 and Ch.4), excessive air leaks associated with the use on non-airtight N-Type connectors, temperature sensitivity in the main stator rotor seal resulting in increased leakage in cold weather, and failure of various bearing assemblies attributed to heat-related hardening of bearing grease.</p>
<p>The Government has form, fit, and function data on the rotary joint, only, as the design is proprietary to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). In lieu of a complete technical data package, the NWS is prepared to provide qualified offerors with a quantity of units that can be disassembled and analyzed. For those offerors proposing a different design, the Government favors and existing design that can be modified to meet WSR-88D requirements rather than a completely new development. The primary objective of this procurement would be to award the replacement of the entire inventory of the existing Az Rotary Joints used in the WSR-88D radar. This would likely be accomplished by attrition. As units fail, they would be replaced by re-designed or new units provided under the subject contract. Total quantity to be provided would be 220.</p>
<p>PURPOSE<br />a. To determine industry capabilities to fulfil the aforementioned requirement.<br />b. To determine size standard of vendors capable of fulfilling the aforementioned requirement.<br />c. To identify any special requirements associated with this industry. <br />d. To obtain a rough order of magnitude (ROM).</p>
<p>RESPONSE FORMAT<br />In order to better assist in the review of submittals to this notice, respondents are encouraged to prepare a capabilities statement that closely adheres to the following format:</p>
<p>The document format shall be either Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx), or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) formats.

Statement of Work
 Temporary Pacemakers

The CMC VAMC has a need to replace two dual chambers and four single chamber temporary pacemakers which are older and at end of life cycle. 

The temporary pacemaker devices are used in urgent/critical patient care situations where short-term demand (synchronous) or asynchronous pacing is indicated for therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic purposes. 

Currently, CMC VAMC utilizes the single and dual chamber models manufactured by Medtronic. For staff and physician familiarity/competency purposes as well as patient safety, it is the desire of Cardiology to maintain consistency and minimize change.
User Criteria: Easy to configure and operate, ergonomic- small enough to grip with one hand and program with the other; long service life >5 years; ease of use requiring fewer manual device adjustments with no sub-menus; easy to view rate, output and sensitivity settings; and a device that adjusts pacing output voltage in response to changes in lead impedance.
Specifically, CMC VAMC has a need for two dual chamber temporary pacemakers with the following functionality:

<RESPDATE>090918
<ARCHDATE>09242018
<CONTACT>Beals, Trisha
<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is to announce that the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is proposing to negotiate a contract with Li-Cor Bio Sciences on a sole-source basis, for the purchase of one (1) LI-7700 Open Path CH4 Analyzer. This is not a solicitation.  All costs associated with providing information, as requested by this Sources Sought Notice, shall be the responsibility of the submitter.  Submission is voluntary.
The USGS has concluded that this product is unique and only available from LICOR Bio Sciences. The reasons justifying a sole source acquisition is a lack of competition. The specifics of the acquisition that permit limiting competition are:
This instrument will be used to collect accurate and reliable methane concentrations under normal ambient atmospheric conditions with very low power requirements. These measurements will be used in conjunction with a sonic anemometer an open path LI-7500 analyzer that measures carbon dioxide and water vapor, to produce half hour gas fluxes to evaluate the daily net ecosystem exchange of carbon.
The LI7700 open path methane analyzer is unique as it uses a high precision laser application, Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy (WMS) technology, but only requiring 8 watts of power that can be supplied by a small solar panel system in remote locations. Briefly, the laser scans across a single feature in the 2Â¿3 absorption band of methane near 1.6 microns with both high resolution and frequency. The wavelength is modulated at sub-MHz frequency, virtually eliminating 1/f noise of the laser source and allowing detection of fractional absorption (less than 10-5). The LI-7700 demodulates the resulting signal at twice the modulation frequency, and then compares it to a reference signal shape to determine CH4 concentration. WMS provides very rapid measurements, allowing the LI-7700 to output data at up to 40 Hz through the Ethernet.  The analyzer measures methane concentrations of 2000 ppb, with a resolution of 5 parts per billion (ppb) at 10 hertz.  This new laser technology decreases the optical path length required and in return reduces the possible effects of contamination from dirt, dust and water droplets. Additionally, this sensor uses open path technology, which eliminates the need for an external pump that is required by competitive products to measure eddy covariance fluxes at 10 hertz. 
The analyzer can work under ambient atmospheric conditions, outputs methane measurements as fast as 20 Hz, which is necessary for eddy covariance, can run on 8 watts of DC power, and use wavelength modulation spectroscopy, which reduces the total optical path length and the possibility of contamination. The linearity of the methane measurements are within 1% of the reading and the resolution is 5 ppb at 10 Hz and 2000 ppb. The output can be either digital Ethernet, RS232, analog and synchronous device for measurement (SDM) for use with data loggers.
The LICOR Bio Sciences open path gas analyzer meets all the requirements to accurately measure the exchange of methane using the open path eddy covariance technique. There are other companies that produce bench-top methane analyzers using Cavity Output Spectroscopy (ICOS) and Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) laser technology. Both techniques require high reflectivity mirrors and multiple passes in their optical cells to increase their optical path lengths. The long path lengths increase the vulnerability of contamination, something that the LI-7700 is able to reduce. Most importantly, the bench-top methane analyzers require an external pump to measure methane fluxes at 10 Hz. This requirement makes remote application almost impossible without commercial power availability.
LICOR Bio Sciences, is the only known source for this equipment that can meet equipment specifications and integration requirements. This equipment is designed to integrate with our existing eddy covariance greenhouse gas flux tower system.  
Interested firms who feel that they can provide the analysis (based upon the criteria specified herein), are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response must include references with contact names, email address, and phone numbers. These references are to be for contracts similar in scope as the contract under consideration. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Affirmative responses must also include supporting information showing the firm can meet all requirements set forth in this announcement.  
All responses must be submitted NLT 09/09/2018 at 4:00pm MST via e-mail to: tbeals@usgs.gov.

This is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), or Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. Any solicitation that may be issued will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (Fedbizopps.gov) website and no paper copies will be provided.

The USGS has concluded that this product is unique and only available from Cameca Instruments, Inc. The reasons justifying a sole source acquisition is a lack of competition. The specifics of the acquisition that permit limiting competition are:

Cameca is the only known vendor to offer a service contract as well as parts and modifications to the NP2 mass spectrometer and its software system as they own the proprietary rights to the equipment. The vendor does not have authorized resellers to perform this maintenance. 

Nu Instruments, through its parent company Cameca, is the manufacturer of the NP2 mass spectrometer, and is the only one who can provide instrument support and service. When an emergency repair service is initiated during the performance period, the repair will not be considered complete until the instrument is performing to manufacturer specifications.

Interested firms who feel that they can provide the analysis (based upon the criteria specified herein), are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response must include references with contact names, email address, and phone numbers. These references are to be for contracts similar in scope as the contract under consideration. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Affirmative responses must also include supporting information showing the firm can meet all requirements set forth in this announcement.  
All responses must be submitted NLT 09/09/2018 at 4:00pm MST via e-mail to: tbeals@usgs.gov.

This is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), or Invitation for Bid (IFB) and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. Any solicitation that may be issued will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (Fedbizopps.gov) website and no paper copies will be provided.

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice. The Government is seeking to identify qualified sources under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541330Engineering Services. The small business size standard is $15.0 Million. This Sources Sought is for market research purposes only and IS NOT A REQUEST FOR STANDARD FORM 330 OR A REQUEST FOR PRICE PROPOSAL nor does it restrict the government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.

<p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION. <br />The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville (CEHNC) is the designated Mandatory Center of Expertise for the Range and Training Land Program (RTLP).

CEHNC is seeking capability statements from firms interested in proposing on an Indefinite Delivery Contract for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Design Services in support of the RTLP. Any contracts awarded will be procured in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers (formally known as the Brooks Architect-Engineer Act) as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6 and Engineering Pamphlet 715-1-7. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and professional qualifications for the required work. CEHNC anticipate a twenty four (24) month base ordering period and three (3) twelve (12) month optional ordering periods; for a five (5) year total ordering period. The anticipated contract capacity is estimated at $45M.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure this as a full and open acquisition with a portion set-aside for small businesses. As a result, the Government is performing market research in order to determine if small businesses possess the capability to execute the requirements within this acquisition. Respondents need to indicate all small business designations (small business, 8(a), certified HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman Owned, Minority, Native American and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned). Interested small business firms who meet the capability requirements identified in this notice are requested to reply to this notice with a response to the questions attached. If no experience or capabilities are associated with a particular question, so indicate. Based upon small business responses received, consideration will be given to defining what part, or all, of the acquisition will be set-aside for small business competition.<br /><br />2.

Other countries outside the Continental United States may be added if deemed appropriate after an analysis of the regulations and international agreement terms between the United States and the respective foreign country. However, the contract file will be documented accordingly to ensure compliance with the approved acquisition plan. It's been recognized that foreign country contracting may involve unique challenges or require local clauses when preparing solicitation(s) (e.g., Japan requires indirect contracting and Korea requires contractor and tech rep status local clauses to be incorporated), so coordination will be done with the Office of Counsel to ensure all appropriate clauses and provisions are included.</p>

Unique features include a side delivery sample extraction port which allows sampling to be conducted during conveyance unloading. High capacity bin (minimum 5,000 pounds of peanuts) is necessary to allow capture and weight of both high density, high volume materials (corn, peanuts) and low density, high volume material (cotton). High clearance hydraulic cylinders for side dump off-loading are required to transfer materials from the weigh cart to larger conveyances. Side dump off-loading is required because we cannot use auger unloading in peanut and cotton due to crop damage and clogging. Load cell capacity range of 5 to 8000 lbs with a less than 0.5% accuracy is required. Our market research showed there are no other similar systems available that can do this, and there are no other distributors of this system.Our justification to award is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br />All inquiries on this action can be submitted in writing via email to juan.gaytan@ars.usda.gov NO LATER THAN&nbsp;17 SEP 2018 @ 8:00AM EST.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS), Wildlife Services (WS) program in Hawaii intends to award a sole source Purchase Order to Bull Creek Welding and Fabrication, Inc. located in Beebe, AR for 2 (each) Game Changer Jr. brand name, trailer mounted, remote controlled, feral hog trapping systems with associated parts and accessories and cargo shipping to Hawaii. This purchase will be conducted under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i). Bull Creek Welding and Fabrication is the manufacturer and the only source for the purchase of these supplies.<br /><br />The feral hog trapping systems will be used in support of the statewide feral hog damage management program. The USDA APHIS WS program in Hawaii requires a trapping system that can be remotely monitored and activated through a smartphone with Verizon cellular service which has the broadest coverage area in the Hawaiian Islands. Any alternative systems must have an electronically activated trap door and the trap itself must be part of a trailer system for greater setup efficiency and ease of use at different locations. Market research indicated that other traps would need to be loaded into a pickup, or placed on a trailer, which requires additional manpower and effort. This system will cut down on the amount of time to plan, load, deliver, and set up.<br /><br />Item Descriptions of the trapping system required:<br /><br />2 (each) -- Game Changer Jr Trailer with 3500 lb. axle; Hinge panel with spring pin locks for transportation; Front, rear and easy lift hinge panel jack; includes drive-in anchors and pins; all gates and panels are 5'6" tall with 2 x 4 welded wire mesh; Camera and Antenna pole; 2 - 8' Gates with Electronic Latch; 8 - 8" Panels which includes one walk thru gate<br /><br />2 (each) -- Electronic Package (1 - 12v Marine Battery; Live View Camera System with Output Gate Drop; 150W Solar Panel with Charge Controller; Omni Directional Antenna)<br /><br />2 (each) - Game Changer Spare Tire<br /><br />The anticipated Purchase Order value is $25,730.00, including marine cargo shipping. This notice is for informational purposes only. No formal solicitation will be issued. Any questions or inquiries or statements of equivalent capabilities must be e-mailed to the Contracting Specialist Michael.J.Chiodi@aphis.usda.gov as the point of contact in this notice by 4:00pm central time on September 13, 2018.<br />

The RDMR-SEM Obsolescence Engineering Branch evaluates electronics manufacturing trends to assess microcircuit and component obsolescence risks for Army aviation and missile systems and other DoD products. This includes interfacing with part/component manufacturers, vendors, and government personnel to monitor manufacturing and supplier trends against military life cycle production needs (including spares and multiple users).<br />In order to fulfill these requirements, a commercially available subscription tool is required. The tool must contain the following attributes:<br />- Ability to import bill of material information<br />- Identify critical components using search features<br />- Provide form, fit, and function alternates for any part<br />- Access device datasheets directly from the application<br />- Provide aftermarket sources and inventory<br />- Single part of BOM device availability and out-year projections<br />- Access Product Discontinuance of Notices<br />- Generate custom reports based on BOM data<br />- Provide process change and material change notices<br />- Provide material content information<br />- Access alert notices directly from the application<br />- Recognize approximately 90% of current Army part library<br />- Web based<br />- 508 compliant<br />1.2 Background. SiliconExpert Technologies is the only subscription tool that provides all of the above required information and is the only tool that was surveyed that provided counterfeit risk information on electronic components. It is the only tool that provides a list of graded alternatives with multiple manufacturers to include the differences in packaging and parametric features for each part number. It is also the only tool to provide a counterfeit risk calculated based on manufacturer alerts and material shortages. SiliconExpert Technologies is the only tool to provide pricing information which is critical to the development of accurate cost analysis and POM projections.</p>

Military and Industry Standard index data IAW DI-AVCS-80700A. The customized extracts contain the available "metadata" of Military and Industry specifications/standards required to maintain the AMCOM configuration management, spares/major item acquisition, and commercial maintenance and overhaul database (Interactive Configuration Management and Procurement Program (ICAPP)). These data files (military and industry) shall be ASCII files containing all of the tagged fields provided in the Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) sample format. The customized extracts shall also include the families of documents (Military). <br />1.2. The "Metadata" to support the ICAPP maintenance shall be copied by IHS Global Inc. to an IHS Global Inc. identified server that shall be made accessible to specified AMCOM users. AMCOM users will be able to "ftp" the data from the IHS Global Inc. site to an AMCOM server. IHS Global Inc. shall provide the necessary technical support to AMCOM personnel (or AMCOM support contractors) to ensure the extraction of the data files is 100% complete. The files shall contain only the differences from the prior week to the current week. To ensure completeness, IHS Global Inc. shall, at the government's request, provide a complete "refresh" of the data from a specified incremental extract to the most current incremental extract at the time of the request. <br />1.3. IHS Global Inc. shall notify the government via email when problems surface that delay the weekly data extracts from being placed on the IHS Global Inc. ftp site. In addition, the contractor shall provide an estimated date when the data shall be made available.<br />1.4. The contractor shall prepare listings of counts by Kind Code (Military) and Society (Industry) IAW DI-MISC-80508 for each extract and the listings shall be emailed to specified individuals at the time the IHS Global Inc. index data file extracts (reference the CDRL sample formats) are made available on the ftp site. The listings shall show the counts by Kind Code and Society associated with the particular extracts. <br />2.1. The contractor shall be available to answer questions and confirm actions taken relating to any changes in the data extracts offering impact to data counts due to the re-naming of society acronyms, removal of society acronyms, removal or addition of kind codes, etc.<br />2.2. IHS Global Inc. shall evaluate each requested modification to the IHS Global Inc. extraction process to ensure format consistency, e.g., societies encountered in the Military TL field with revisions appended to document identifiers. Based on this evaluation, the parties will, on a case-by-case basis, reach a mutual agreement on how to proceed.<br />

<CONTACT>Jennifer N. Felt, Contract Specialist, Email jennifer.n.felt2.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><br />TITLE: Request for Information (RFI): Department of Defense&nbsp;and&nbsp;Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Staffing Services (DoD VA HCSS)<br /><br /><br />INTRODUCTION:<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued by the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Component Acquisition Executive J-4. The intent of this RFI is to research the marketplace and obtain companies' feedback on the capabilities available in industry to supplement clinical operations in Department of Defense (DoD) Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and/or the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) medical facilities within the Continental United States (CONUS) and its territories. For these requirements, the Government utilizes Product Service Code (PSC) Category "Q" in the Federal Procurement Data System. Specifically, Q201 through Q527 as defined in the Product and Service Codes Manual (https://www.fpds.gov/downloads/top_requests/PSC_Manual_FY2016_Oct1_2015.pdf). This requirement will not include consultants, advisors or subject matter experts, housekeeping, facility maintenance, information technology or food services. <br /><br />BACKGROUND:<br />The DHA has partnered with the VA to determine the feasibility of a joint strategic solution for the delivery of integrated, high-quality health care services to 19 million beneficiaries. Both agencies operate medical facilities in the United States and its territories as shown below. The facilities include clinics (stand alone, non-bedded facilities), community hospitals, and medical centers that are staffed by DoD, VA, military personnel, civilian employees and contractor staff. The contracted staff is comprised of numerous clinical occupations. These include health care providers/workers in the following broad functional categories supporting inpatient and outpatient facilities: Ancillary, Dental, Nursing and Physician Services. See attachment for details on the types of facilities by customer.
<p>A listing of DOD facilities by state is included as an attachment along with a summary and website link to the Veterans Integrated Service Networks. These may be helpful to interested companies as they complete the 56-question survey.<br /><br />GOALS OF THE RFI:<br />&bull; Determine industry practice variations for acquisitions of similar services, duration and performance location. <br />&bull; Determine industry capabilities to fulfill DoD/VA combined requirement..<br />&bull; Verify whether small business is a viable partner for this program.<br />&bull; Confirm appropriate NAICS and size standard.<br />&bull; Determine if DoD/VA requirements and contract structure aligns with industry practices.<br />&bull; Identify industry leaders<br />&bull; Assess competition</p>
<p>The RFI is designed to demonstrate industry capabilities for DoD VA HCSS. Survey information captured from this RFI will only be used for market research and participation is voluntary.</p>
<p>ACRONYMNS/DEFINITIONS:<br />Terms are often misunderstood due to the ambiguous nature of complex health care requirements coupled with military jargon. Therefore, the following should be considered prior to completing the survey. If needed, further definitions clarifying intent are included in the actual survey questions.</p>
<p>1. Ancillary Services: Services provided by qualified workers who deliver patient treatment or assist in the provision of patient treatment including, but not limited to, audiologists, clinical laboratory personnel, dietitians, mid-level providers (i.e., nurse practitioners, physician assistants), occupational therapists, pharmacists, physical therapists, podiatrists, radiology support, respiratory therapists, speech pathologists, and clinical support staff such as medical assistants.</p>
<p>2. Clinical Services: Direct care of acute and chronic medical conditions. This includes all services involved in assessment, diagnosis, treatment, patient movement, advice, recommendations and area/equipment preparation.</p>
<p>3. Deliverable: Anything that can be physically delivered, which may include, but is not limited to, meeting minutes, staff rosters, key personnel or routine reports.</p>
<p>4. Dental Services: Services provided by qualified workers who deliver dental care including, but not limited to, general dentists and specialty dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants and dental lab technicians.</p>
<p>5. Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Employee: For this RFI, a worker is considered a full-time employee if they perform 1920 or more hours annually.</p>
<p>6. Health Care Support Services (HCSS): This RFI is for HCSS which is defined as personnel who provide clinical care in ancillary, dental, nursing or physician service areas (see those definitions). This does not include personnel whose duties are primarily administrative or clerical in nature, or provide maintenance or security services.</p>
<p>7. Health support service: As defined in Joint Publication 1-02, DoD Definitions and Abbreviations, "All services performed, provided or arranged to promote, improve, conserve, or restore the mental or physical well-being of personnel. These services include, but are not limited to, the management of health services resources, such as manpower, monies, and facilities; preventative and curative health measures; evacuation of the wounded, injured, or sick; selection of the medically fit and disposition of the medically unfit; blood management; medical supply, equipment and maintenance thereof; combat stress control; and medical, dental, veterinary, laboratory, optometric, nutrition therapy, and medical intelligence services."</p>
<p>8. Temporary Services (a.k.a., Locum Tenens): A worker filling a position or temporarily covering for another worker for a period of performance of 13 weeks, but less than one year in duration.</p>
<p>9. Military Departments (MILDEPs): Air Force, Army or Navy.</p>
<p>10. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS): NAICS is used as the Federal standard for classifying business establishments.</p>
<p>11. Nursing Services: Services provided by a qualified registered and/or licensed nurse including all types of registered and advanced practice nurses as well as practical and vocational nurses. Technicians and other assistants working in nursing services are considered in the Ancillary Services market segment.</p>
<p>12. Physician Services: Primary and specialty care physicians who deliver routine, preventive, and specialty care services to patients and are subject to privileging by the medical facility.</p>
<p>13. Primary Business: the main purpose, objective and mission of a company. For this RFI, health care staffing services is the primary business.</p>
<p>14. Medical Facility: A DoD or VA hospital or clinic to include dental clinics as well as satellite areas such as standalone clinics and medical operations (i.e., health and wellness centers). The medical facility may be a clinic, hospital, or medical center. Clinics are outpatient facilities offering primary care or simple specialty care (i.e., routine exams, tests, treatments). A clinic may be a stand-alone site or a satellite of a larger clinic, hospital, or medical center, to include patient centered medical homes. Hospitals offer more complex, resource-intensive secondary care (i.e., inpatient care, surgery under anesthesia) and primary care. Medical centers offer tertiary (i.e., sophisticated diagnosis/treatment of any ailment), secondary, and primary care, hospital services, preventive services, blood bank, and other services.</p>
<p>15. Privileging: The process whereby the privileging authority, upon recommendation from the credentials committee, grants individuals the authority and responsibility for making independent decisions to diagnosis, initiate, alter, or terminate a regimen of medical or dental care.<br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:<br />The intent of this RFI is to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR 10.002 and FAR 15.201. It is for informational purposes only. This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any supply or service.

This should help you gather the requirement information prior to entry into the survey program. <br />Completing this survey will allow DHA to collect the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative that the Government may or may not contact for additional information.</p>

<DESC><br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.
<div><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Material Measurement Laboratory (MML), Biomolecular Measurement Division (BMD) in Gaithersburg, MD is planning to acquire a mass spectrometer system capable of generating high quality tandem mass spectra of ions generated by electrospray ionization for a very wide range of ion classes and fragmentation modes. NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 1,000 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice. Note that 13 CFR &sect; 125.6 is applicable to this procurement, and as such, would need to comply with the limitations on subcontracting or qualify as a non-manufacturer (see https://www.sba.gov/contracting/contracting-officials/non-manufacturer-rule/non-manufacturer-waivers).  If a small business cannot meet the requirements of 13 CFR &sect; 125.6 in response to the below requirements, it should indicate so in its response. <br />The mass spectrometer shall acquire spectra for many applications including: building mass spectrum reference libraries of all precursor ions of selected pure compounds under the most widely applied fragmentation modes; analysis of all ions arising from protein digests in order to identify of as many number and variety peptides with high quality spectra as possible; and to acquire good quality spectra for all ionized components in mixtures of metabolites and other mixtures of small molecules including environmental samples and food extracts.  Given the spectra that must be acquired, the relative concentrations over a wide range for selected ions, and the range of samples that must be examined, the required system must have the ability to perform in the following manner:<br />1.	Generate reliable spectra for the scientific community with the employment of two<br />fragmentation methods: a beam-type collision cell at selectable collision energies and an ion trap capable of producing multistage fragmentation.  The instrument must also be capable of passing ions between the ion trap and beam-type collision cell.<br />2.	Capable of performing multi-level fragmentation in the ion trap.<br />3.	Select ions for study at sub 1 Dalton level required for the analysis of ions in very complex mixtures containing isobaric contaminants.<br />4.	Fragment ions from one fragmentation device by another that is required for identification of classes of ions such as glycopeptides, glycans and small molecules. <br />5.	Perform accurate quantitative analysis of isobaric coded tags, such as iTRAQ (Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) and TMT (tandem mass tags) technologies, requires isolation and fragmentation of an ion of the highest intensity to avoid contamination artefacts.<br />6.	Operate in both the nanospray and conventional mode since the instrument is to be used for proteomic and metabolomics experiments. This may require instrument reconfiguration. <br />7.	Does not need to perform electron transfer dissocation (ETD) or come equipped with a nitrogen generator.<br />8.	Include a UPS compatible with the instrument
<p>Instrument Characteristics:  <br />1.	The mass spectrometer must contain multiple ion fragmentation and detection devices.<br />2.	Must be equipped with a complete nanoLC system with all components required for<br />nanospray.<br />3.	All components required for electrospray other than the LC system shall be included.<br />4.	Sensitivity of 100 fg reserpine leading to 200:1 S/N for fragmentation to major ions<br />5.	MS2 maximum scan rate of at least 12 Hz and up to 20 Hz<br />6.	Minimum mass of 50 Da or lower<br />7.	Maximum resolution equal to 500,000 at 200 m/z or higher<br />8.	Mass accuracy of 1 ppm or lower using internal standard<br />9.	Dynamic intrascan range of at least 5,000<br />10.	Low mass ions (50-500 Da) for fragmentation must be isolatable within 0.2 m/z.</p>
<p>Installation and Training:<br />The system shall be installed by the contractor.  Installation, at a minimum, shall include uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, rigging (as appropriate), setup and hook-up of the system, demonstration of all specifications, and removal of trash. Onsite training shall be provided at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD and shall be completed not later than 30 days after delivery.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS: <br />Companies that are capable of providing this mass spectrometer are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to Wendy.Paulo@nist.gov no later than the response date for these sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. <br />Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:<br />1.	Name of the company(s) that offer the required supply. In addition, provide a point of contact for the company(s).<br />2.	Business Size in accordance with NAICS code 334516.<br />3.	Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery.<br />4.	Rough estimate of pricing (if available, not required); and<br />5.	Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

Scope of Work

General Information: 
One replacement camera (new)for Willow Grove CBOC
One new camera for 63rd & Market Street Annex

Scope of Work:
Willow Grove CBOC   Purchase and installation of a replacement fundus camera. The current fundus camera is irreparable, per Biomed department. Fundus photography at Willow Grove CBOC is done on a daily basis and is a vital and necessary adjunct to patient management in all eye clinics.
63rd & Market Street Annex- Purchase and installation of a new fundus camera. 
The fundus camera, an ophthalmic imaging device, is a combination of a high-resolution camera and low power microscope. A fundus camera is commonly used for fundus/retina imaging, external photography, paired optic disk images, and fluorescein angiography. Some of the commonly occurring disorders which are managed through fundus photography are retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinal vascular disease and glaucoma. The greater prevalence of retinal and macula disorders, the increase in geriatric population, and advancements in technologies have driven the usage and necessity of the fundus camera in every eye clinic.

 Advanced Analysis:
After review of feedback from several other VA s , along with market research, it is evident that the Canon CX-1 Hybrid Digital Myd/Non-Myd Retinal Camera System is the most advanced and capable system and should be both the replacement and newly purchased fundus camera for the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center. Of note, this system as well as other manufacturer s brands of fundus cameras can only be purchased with its own DiCOM software

The Canon CX-1 Hybrid Digital Myd/Non-Myd Retinal Camera and software provides the following features:

Color, Red-Free, Cobalt, Fluorescein Angiography and Fundus Autofluorescence Photography modes for both Mydriatic alignment and imaging and Non-Mydriatic alignment  imaging
Optical head Pan/Tilt with 30 degree right/left (pan) and 15 degree up/ 10 degree down (tilt)
Fluorescein Angiography acquisition capable at 1 frame/second for 10 consecutive seconds
Canon EOS 20 Megapixel dedicated external camera body, removable to allow for upgrade to greater Megapixel camera when available
Canon imageSPECTRUM software with DiCOM Modality Worklist and DiCOM Storage compatibility with CPRS and VistA Imaging.
VAMC VistA Imaging Approved DiCOM Modality Device
https://www.va.gov/HEALTH/imaging/docs/VistA_Imaging_DICOM_Modality_Interfaces.pdf
FDA 410 cleared for all five photography modes and two alignment imaging modes

The investigative history for contractor personnel working under this contract must be maintained in the databases of either the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO).Â  Should the contractor use a vendor other than OPM or Defense Security Service (DSS) to conduct investigations, the investigative company must be certified by OPM/DSS to conduct contractor investigations.

3.  Background:  The fundus camera at the Willow Grove CBOC eye clinic is no longer functional. This system is necessary to manage retinal and retinal vascular disease, macula disorders and optic nerve pathology.  The current fundus camera, which was has stopped working.  Repairs have been attempted, however technological advances in fundus imaging systems have now rendered the current camera system archaic and non- functional. Not having a functioning retina camera at this busy clinic, which also receives referrals for fundus photography from other CBOC s, hinders patient care greatly, and thus a replacement unit needs to be purchased as soon as possible. 
The new annex at 63rd & Market Street for the time being will be performing tele-retinal imaging until such time Optometry and/or Ophthalmology begin offering services at this location.
4.  Performance Period:  N/A
5. Type of Contract: fixed price

<CONTACT>Ayi J. Ayayi, Contract Specialist, Email ayi.j.ayayi.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:<br />This notice announces the intent by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Pilot Bioproduction Facility (PBF), to procure HEPA Transfer Cart (with accessories) without competition as prescribed in FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i). Specifically, the Government will procure this system manufactured by Integrated Containment Systems. The required HEPA Transfer system can only be purchased from Integrated Containment Systems who has no resellers.
<p>The HEPA Transfer Cart and the 4 x 4 Cleanroom Module are a combination, customized pairing of equipment. The Transfer Cart is a self-contained Class 100 enclosure with a particle counter. The unit is designed for transport of product from classified areas through unclassified areas back to a classified area. The Cleanroom Module is an integrated containment system for the cart that Allows transfer of aseptic filled vaccine from a Class 100 BSC into the HEPA Tranfer Cart while providing a continual Class 100 air environment during transfer. This continuous Class 100 environment is a cGMP requirement for open vaccine product.</p>
<p>This system is a requirement to allow the PBF to produce manually-filled vaccine material when circumstances prevent them from putting the material into the automated fill line (e.g. a live virus vaccine or other material that may cause a cross-contamination risk, or vial sizes for which we do not have fill line change parts). The HEPA transfer cart is required to move materials between the Biological Safety Cabinet and the lyophilizer because the background air quality is lower than that required by FDA for open product transfer. Due to space constraints and room configuration, the transfer cart must be custom made to fit the space and needs of the PBF. The Current manufacturer is the only vendor capable of providing the customized piece of equipment to meet the specific specification based on the outline and the space provided within the PBF. <br />The system itself must be equipped with an access opening composed of one Lexan sliding door and silicone gaskets to function with the current operating procedures within the current facility. This unit must also be supplied with an integrated particle sampling port that can be connected to an external particle sampler currently used, such as the MetOne system. The Integrated Containment Systems unit is the only manufacturer that can provide the combination of needs in this customized system. There is no alternative to the HEPA Transfer Cart that can be connected to the existing MetOne system external particle sampler currently used, and accommodate the existing room configuration.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 339112 and FSC 6515.</p>
<p>Proposed solicitation number: W81XWH-18-R-0122.</p>
<p>This announcement fulfills the synopsis requirements under FAR 5.102(a)(6) and 5.203(a). USAMRAA intends to publish a solicitation no sooner than 15 days after publishing this synopsis. This Special Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written<br />responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the solicitation will be issued as sole source.</p>
<p>All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to Ayi Ayayi at ayi.j.ayayi.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>Interested concerns must identify their capability in writing to the email address listed above no later than 4:00 PM ET, 20 September 2018.</p>

STATEMENT OF REQUIRMENTS
Intimate Partner Violence Resource Library

Eastern Kansas Health Care System s (EKHCS) Domestic Violence/Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program Coordinator (DV/IPV) is a clinical social worker whose primary responsibilities are to develop, implement and manage EKHCS  Domestic Violence/Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program, ensuring compliance and collaboration with VA Central Office Domestic Violence/Intimate Partner Violence Assistance Program initiatives.  The IPV Program Coordinator provides Veterans, family, Caregivers and staff education on domestic violence and intimate partner violence; community outreach; resource development; continuous quality improvement activities. In addition, the IPV Coordinator provides clinical evidence-based services including, assessments and interventions and evaluation/consultation to Veterans, their families, caregivers, and staff. The program focuses on developing a culture of safety and adopts a holistic, trauma-informed approach to services and support for those who experience and/or use IPV.
This program is mandated nationally throughout the VA.  Because of this mandate, and the newness of the program, the IPV Coordinator is requesting to acquire written materials to assist with providing clinical services to Veterans.  In addition, resources will be available to the Veterans experiencing IPV in order to provide education and resources for them.  Other VA clinicians will be able to access this information in order to be better informed about the program and how to appropriately treat patients that are victimized.  The IPV coordinator has the responsibility to provide education to staff, Veterans, families and caregivers and having resources available to do that will be imperative to meeting their job requirements.
