<ARCHDATE>08052008
<CONTACT>Irie Clarke, Contracting Officer, 202-287-1421, Irie.Clarke@HQ.DOE.GOV;Mary Wideman, Contract Specialist, 202-287-1571, mary.wideman@hq.doe.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Health, Safety, and Security (HSS) intends to extend the period of performance of contract number DE-AC01-06SA06044 with Jupiter Corporation on a sole source bridge basis to provide uninterrupted support to HSS while the follow-on competitive acquisition and transition is completed.  The follow-on competitive acquisition began with a Sources Sought Notice (DE-RP01-06SA06006) which was issued on March 13, 2006. The Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued under Solicitation Number DE-RP01-07HS07014 on October 5, 2007.  Proposals have been submitted, evaluation is underway, and award is anticipated under the RFP in the near future. This extension will continue the performance period of the current contract for an initial three month period and shall include two (2) additional three-month option periods.  However, it is possible that no additional extension will be required (i.e., award is made before the expiration date of current contract). This support is currently being performed by Jupiter under contract number DE-AC01-06SA06044 and will expire on February 18, 2008. The mission of HSS is to develop strategies and policies governing the protection of national security and other critical assets entrusted to the Department of Energy, and to strengthen the Departments National Security posture through conscientious, just and thoughtful application of Federal rules and statues governing personnel security to ensure that only individuals whose character, associations and loyalty are granted access to DOE classified information and materials.  The work performed under this contract includes the following specific tasks: visitor control request processing; initial clearance request processing; reinvestigation processing; reciprocal request processing to include Congressional and White House; clearance terminations, continuations, reinstatements, transfers, and upgrades; clearance notifications; personnel security file maintenance; investigative report screening, analysis, and adjudication; preparation of letters of interrogatory; personnel security interviewing; support to the DOE Administrative Review Program; transcription services; and psychiatric evaluation services.  The estimated level-of-effort for each three-month period is 8,835 Direct Productive Labor Hours (DPLH). The Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Position Qualifications for this Jupiter contract are included as attachments to this synopsis and are provided on the Departments Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS).  There are no solicitation documents available for this requirement. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 USC 2304[c][1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. Jupiter has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security clearances, technical skill and training, who are familiar with the program and requirements, and who are available to provide services pending the award of the competitive follow-on contract.  In addition, all personnel are required to have DOE Q level security clearances to perform work under this contract.  There are approximately 20 individuals working on the existing contract.  If this contract does not get extended, not only would there be a significant delay due to the time required to complete the competitive acquisition, but there would be additional delays in order for individuals to acquire the appropriate security clearances.  Jupiters staff has the requisite knowledge and experience and required security clearances, and can proceed without interruption.  Interested parties submitting responses to this notice must provide a capability statement demonstrating its capability to perform the requirements of the PWS without interruption and at a minimum must include the following:  (1) a statement that proposed personnel are currently employed by the responding party and will be available to perform the contemplated work; or a letter of commitment from personnel that the responding party intends to use to perform the contemplated work who are not currently employed by the responding party, demonstrating that they will be available to perform the contemplated work; (2) a chart or other delineation of the educational and experience qualifications of personnel proposed for the contemplated work consisted with the position descriptions provided with this notice; (3) a chart or other delineation demonstrating that proposed personnel currently hold a Q access authorization; (4) a copy of any teaming, subcontract, or other agreement between any parties that would be performing the contemplated work as part of a team; and (5) a certification that the responding party possesses a facility security clearance and complies with the Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence, FOCI program. Responses to this synopsis must be received via the Departments Industry Interactive Procurement System by 7:00 p.m. EST on February 5, 2008 to be considered.  The web address is http://e-center.doe.gov.  Assistance in posting a submission through the system can be obtained by calling the help desk at 1-800-683-0751 between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. eastern time, Monday through Friday. The information received in response to this notice may also be used for other market research purposes. Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered within thirty (30) days of this notice to the DOE IIPS website. If a determination is subsequently made by the Government to compete for the services (planned to be provided under this bridge contract by Jupiter), a competition will be conducted for the remaining three 3-month option periods. It would not be possible to conduct this competition for the initial 3-month period, and as described above, it is unacceptable to have a break in service for this work. Thus, the bridge contract will continue during the initial 3-month extension period while the competition is being held for the available option period(s) needed until the competitive acquisition under solicitation number DE-RP01-07HS07014 is completed. A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for the option periods based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The intent of this award is to provide the required services until the award and transition of a competitive follow-on acquisition is completed as described in the first paragraph above. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541690. *** Numbered Note 22 Applies.

<DESC>The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), under the Department of Homeland Security, seeks 40 (forty) healthy head of cattle within the weight range of 350 lbs. to 450 lbs. and all with a 50 lbs. weight differential of each other, to be delivered to Orient Point, New York, on Thursday, January 10, 2008.

For this competitive, best value procurement, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certification of the Supplier?s facilities may convey some assurance of an acceptable source.  In addition, the Supplier must ensure and demonstrate that the animals, in particular younger animals, are not overly stressed and fatigued, for instance, as a result of prolonged transportation, which could compromise the animals? immune systems.  Furthermore, in order to minimize any variability between tests, the cattle should come from a homogeneous source without having co-mingled with other cattle.  Any exception to this requirement must be documented and explained.

Prior to departure for Orient Point and PIADC, the Supplier shall verify that each head of cattle has had a veterinary examination along with the appropriate vaccinations (example Bovishield?) and boosters as necessary as well as antibiotics prior to transport to prevent any in transit fever.  Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, each animal shall be issued a health certificate for interstate transportation.  Also, the Supplier shall submit a document with the recent medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments for each animal.  This report shall include, at a minimum, general information identifying the animal by number/ID; the departure date of transport to Orient Point/Plum Island; breed; gender; age or birth date range; (de)horned; weaned; castrated (if applicable); the dates and dosages for vaccines and anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, antibiotic drugs; any other tests and corresponding results; and any other interesting and important information.  Accurate and consistent with the medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments mentioned above, all animals must be:

?	Holsteins;
?	females and/or castrated males;
?	healthy with no overt signs of disease;
?	free of active lameness, respiratory disease, warts, or ringworm;
?	polled or dehorned;
?	tolerant of being haltered (i.e. of tractable temperament and be free of behavioral vices such as charging and kicking); and
?	free of external parasites and have been treated for internal parasites within the last three (3) months (preferably using Ivermectin).

Additional requirements are as follows:

?	the cattle must have un-pigmented (i.e ?pink?) tongues;
?	the hooves of the cattle shall be trimmed prior to shipment; and
?	the ears of the cattle shall be notched for Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).

After notification of award, the Supplier shall deliver (F.O.B. Origin) the cattle, and corresponding documentation to the USDHS/S&T/PIADC Warehouse, 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957 at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, January 10, 2008.  Utilizing a PIADC-owned wooden animal stockade ramp, available at the Orient Point destination, the Supplier shall offload the cattle from their vehicle then load the animals onto a U.S. Government vehicle.

Once the Supplier hands over the cattle to PIADC personnel at Orient Point, the animals will be quarantined and evaluated for seven (7) calendar days.  Any animal that has been delivered but does not meet the criteria listed above or otherwise is considered by PIADC personnel to be unhealthy will be rejected and euthanized.  PIADC personnel will inform the Supplier and prepare an animal incident report and send it, by fax or e-mail or both, to the Supplier promptly (within approximately three (3) calendar days, if reasonable and practicable).  Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, and pending the resolution of any inquires or disputes, the Supplier shall compensate PIADC with an appropriate replacement of cattle for any unacceptable animal(s) following the quarantine and evaluation period.

Please submit your responses before the deadline of 11:59 p.m. on January 3, 2008, to the attention of Ms. Patricia La Riviere-Hom, Contracts Specialist, (Telephone 631-323-3203) via e-mail at patricia.lariviere-hom@dhs.gov, by fax to 631-323-3101, or by mail to Department of Homeland Security, Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:  Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692,  Fax:  (202) 475-3904

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:  Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692,  Fax:  (202) 475-3904

1.0  DESCRIPTION 

State and Local law enforcement agencies, including mass transit agencies have expressed an interest in mobile, low-cost security camera options. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeks to determine the feasibility of low power and low cost, USD $100-200, cameras the memory for which is hardened against possible explosive forces.  Based on state and local discussions, the following factors are particularly desirable:

a. Small form factor, approximately 2 in x 2 in x 1.5 in or less; 
b. Wide area coverage, maximize clarity in recording over the greatest range of distances to the camera without adjustment; 
c. Variable frame rate, allows for adjusting the amount of data recorded and the effective size of memory; 
d. Smart Activation, automated methods through which the camera activates to record interesting events and avoid recording redundant imagery; 
e. Low Power, maximize length of unattended operation of the device using batteries or low power connections available on transport mechanism;  
f. Easy to Install, does not require expert installation and can be readily deployed with no special training; 
g. Operator Friendly, easy to activate and transport as required; 
h. Blast resistance, memory unit hardened to resist blasts; 
i. Tamper resistance, imagery from the device is protected from unauthorized access; 
j. Rolling storage retaining at least one week of continuous coverage.  

The following features are not part of the reference design; their inclusion may lead to additional device costs that exceed the goal. Cost and technical issues related to these features, however, may be of interest:

 Multiple Power Options, at additional cost, makes available solar or power harvesting options for unattended field operation; 
 GPS, capability to receive and record timing and location information from GPS services;  
 Wireless Communications, network capability for reading memory content.  

The camera devices are seen as a mechanism to record events for forensic analysis in mass transportation attacks.  The low cost of the device enables wider coverage, while the reuse of memory and lack of connectivity means that images are likely to be viewed only after an event, thus enhancing privacy. 

2.0 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) OBJECTIVE

The goal of this RFI is to identify whether industry organizations have an interest in producing such a device to realize the minimum functionality indicated in this document.  Through this RFI, DHS is seeking responses to determine the interest of industry and to further refine technical requirements for the device reference design.  Interested parties will be invited to participate in meetings with government and laboratory representatives to discuss the development of the reference design and to better understand requirements for the desired device.  

2.1 RFI QUESTIONS

Q1. Summarize your capability to manufacture low cost/low power electronics.
Q2. Describe the camera that you can design to meet the desired needs.
Q3. How long would it take your to producing the desired camera?
Q4. Describe your interest in the production of the desired camera.
Q5. Project a rough order of magnitude estimate of the cost to produce the desired camera and relationship to desired unit costs at volumes of 10,000 and 100,000.
Q6. What could be done to improve the performance of an existing or near term planned device to achieve a camera product that has the desired characteristics?
Q7. What memory system do you propose and how would it be hardened for blast survivability?
Q8. At what stage of development or maturity is the technology identified in the response to this RFI? 
Q9. What software options, e.g. intelligent scene analysis/storage, can be included as part of the camera? 
Q10. Would the product be upgradeable to utilize optional and/or future advanced memory/software features over time? How? 

3.0  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS 

3.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper, inclusive of answers to the questions posed in Section 2 of this RFI.  Each respondent shall identify its business size.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  White Papers in Microsoft Word compatible format are due no later than 3:00 PM (local Eastern time) on January 18, 2007.   

3.2  DHS reserves the right to review late submissions but makes no guarantee to the order of or possibility for review of late submissions. Responses shall be limited to ten pages and submitted via e-mail ONLY to elizabeth.moya@dhs.gov.  

3.3  Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid DHS, please segregate proprietary information. Be advised that all submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and will not be returned. 

3.4  Responses to this RFI may evaluated by Government technical experts drawn from staff within DHS S&T and other Federal agencies.  The Government may also use selected support contractor personnel to assist in the evaluation.  These support contractors will be bound by appropriate NonDisclosure Agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.

<ARCHDATE>03012008
<CONTACT>Douglas Smith 301-227-1640
<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT ? The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division is soliciting abstracts (?White Papers?) for a Shipboard Selective Access and Retrieval System (SSARS) which captures, lifts and provides omni-directional movement of vehicles and containerized cargo aboard ships at sea based on the Performance Specifications contained at Attachment A (see below).  The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to obtain new, unique and innovative ideas for solutions to technological and operational challenges.  The purpose of the SSARS is to facilitate the ?dense packing? of vehicles and cargo, and enable access to specific items (i.e. selective access) after the ship has been loaded and is at sea.  Current vehicle and cargo handling methods aboard ships require an inordinate amount of time and deck space to maneuver items into and to extract them from stowage locations (i.e. jockeying around corners, parallel parking, etc.). These methods also re!  quire that a large amount of deck space remain open as maneuver area to facilitate offloading.  That deck space is therefore lost as a stowage area.  Multiple contracts may be awarded for the initial conceptual design phase and based on the outcome, the Government may award one or more follow-on efforts to continue through fabrication and testing.  Contractors selected for award of the initial concept design phase shall develop a complete conceptual design of their proposed technologies or systems within 45 days from contract award.  The concept design shall be documented in a substantive white paper describing in detail the operation of the systems or technologies, including lift method, means of omni-directional movement, power sources and utilities required, methods to ensure safe operations on sloped or moving decks, processing rate capability, physical size, maintenance requirements, operational manning requirements, and estimated system cost per unit.  The white paper!   submitted under the concept design phase shall also include a budget  for completing a follow-on Phase II (detailed design) effort. Responses to this BAA announcement shall (1) briefly describe the basic approach the offeror intends to pursue, the range of wheeled vehicles, tracked vehicles, and/or containers the proposed systems or technologies will address, a concept of operations for the proposed systems or technologies, and any prior work that will contribute to the success of the effort; (2) the benefits anticipated should the concept be implemented; (3) a cost estimate for a conceptual design; (4) corporate/personnel experience and ability to successfully perform this effort ; (5) past performance information on similar projects; (6) the offeror?s awareness of the state of the art and technical understanding of the scope of the requirement, including any problem areas; (7) facilities available for fabrication and fabrication approach.  An original and two (2) copies of the white paper shall be submitted on or before 31 Jan 08, 2:00 pm ES!  T to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Code 3320, attn:Douglas Smith, 9500 MacArthur Blvd., West Bethesda, MD 20817-5700.  White papers shall be clearly marked with the BAA number N00167-08-BAA-01.  Proprietary material shall be prominently marked as such.  The selection of one or more sources for contract award will be based on a scientific or peer review process.  The type of award anticipated for the Phase I Conceptual Design is Firm Fixed Price. Contract types for follow-on phases shall be determined.  The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal costs for responses submitted.  Offerors are advised that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government to contract.  All work under this BAA shall be unclassified.   Technical questions in reference to this BAA should be directed to Dr. Stuart Ullman via email at stuart.ullman@navy.mil.  All contractual questions shall be addr!  essed to Mr. Douglas Smith at 301-227-1640 or email to douglas.m.smith @navy.mil.  The Attachment (A) document identified above can be obtained via email by sending a request to Douglas Smith at the email address identified above.  The email title should read ?Request for Attachment (A).  Attachment (A) contains 4 pages of specifications and will be provided as an email reply with the attachment.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate on other than full and open competitive basis with General Sciences Inc., for spaceflight thermite chemical vapor release canisters.  Specific requirements include design, fabrication, ground testing, spaceflight qualification, and sounding rocket flight support for the high metallic vapor fraction barium chemical release canisters.  The chemical canisters must be spaceflight ready in time to support an early 2009 sounding rocket flight opportunity.  General Sciences, Inc., is the only known source that possesses the expertise, knowledge, and experience to perform the required effort in the specified timeframe.  General Sciences holds patents on chemical vaporization technology.  This technique allows for a very high percentage of chemical vapor compared to earlier techniques.  This very high percentage vaporization leads to much reduced payload mass.  Responses detailing an interest in this requirement (referenced in Note 22) must be received within 15 days of this notice.   Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.  NOTE 22.

An alternate      source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification  procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having        jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item         requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is      flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined      adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the          source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have been          solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that  an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an   approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information    detailed in the "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" Naval Inventory Control      Point Philadelphia Source Approval Information Brochure. This brochure           identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's       experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you  have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being          evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which   forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to        provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous   submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be      considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a    source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or   approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to    meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue      based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>DRAFT SYNOPSIS
N62306-08-Q-4009


The Naval Oceanographic Office, Stennis Space Center, MS intends to issue a sole source award toPMD SCIENTIFIC, Inc. in Bloomfield, CT under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  This is a requirement for the purchase of Four (4) EARS SP-400 SENSORS.  These systems are proprietary to PMD SCIENTIFIC, INC.  Four years ago NAVOCEANO conducted extensive market research on seismographic sensors. Among the companies researched were Guralp, Oyo Geospace, Eentec, and PMD Scientific. It was decided that the sensor that best met our needs was the sensor manufactured by PMD Scientific. We then collaborated with PMD to integrate their sensor into our pressure vessel housing as well as the electrical interface requirements necessary for system integration. Testing and analysis of the sensor package has been extensive over the past four years. As all the upfront R&D and testing have been conducted for this sensor, it would not be cost effective for the Navy to integrate an additional sensor that produces the same data into the EARS system.  This action will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The resulting contract will be firm fixed-price.  NAICS Code 334519 and Business Size of 500 employees apply.  This synopsis is published for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive offers.  Any inquiries concerning this requirement are to be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  See Note 22.

<CONTACT>David Bem Contracting Officer 3032360997     David_Bem@blm.gov;
<DESC>Solicitation Number NAR080048 applies and will be issued as a Request for Proposals for the following services: applying various seed mixes on approximately 32,203 acres using Government furnished seed. The six project locations are located in central Nevada within Lander County located near Battle Mountain, Nevada. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: General - The Contractor shall seed an estimated 32,203 acres of designated areas in conformance with these specifications and the detailed specifications.  Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall furnish at work sites applicator(s) experienced in applying seed in rough, rocky or mountainous terrain, all equipment, labor, supplies, and materials required to complete the job.  The Contractor shall service and repair his/her equipment as necessary to maintain satisfactory progress on work.  Estimated start date is February 8, 2008 and all work will be completed by June 1, 2008. Differentially Corrected Global Positioning System (DGPS) - The Contractor shall be required to utilize a DGPS for electronic Navigation.  System must be capable of utilizing ArcGIS or ARC-INFO shape files created by the government and given to the contractor on a standard HD 1.44 mb, 3.5 inch floppy disk, compact disk or USB compatible flash memory stick. (1) On the ground flaggers and an auto-flagger system can supplement the DGPS system, but not substitute for it. Navigation - DGPS is required for tracking, and data collection. The Contractor shall provide all guidance equipment, materials, computers, printers, personnel, and services required for the system to be used.  The system shall be sufficiently sensitive to provide immediate deviation indications (real-time).  The DGPS system must be capable of determining a differentially corrected location with an error of no more than one to two meters in the horizontal plane.  The guidance system shall be capable of updating current position at a rate of a minimum of one time per second.  Differential correction must cover the complete operational area.  During operation, differentially corrected signal must be accurately recorded at least 90% of the operational time.  Differential correction may be, provided by a portable differential station, FM radio fixed towers, or satellite.  Software provided with DGPS must be designed for parallel offset in increments equal to the assigned swath width of the application equipment.  Base of Operations - The Contractor shall provide such landing facilities as may be required for competent performance of contract. The use of any loading area shall be arranged by and at the discretion and risk of the Contractor, and the Government shall not be held responsible for any loss, mishap, or accident due to conditions of any site used.  The Contractor shall provide appropriate warning signs for traffic if roads are used as loading sites. Equipment - The Contractor shall furnish sufficient equipment to satisfactorily seed the designated areas in the time specified as required in the Detailed Specifications.  Equipment shall be capable of traveling at moderate speed and low enough to give proper control and distribution of seed. Communication - The Contractor shall furnish sufficient equipment to have communications with the Government either by using radio frequencies designated by the Project Inspector or by providing a radio to the Project Inspector. Seed Bucket(s) or Hopper(s) - Sagebrush seed presents unique problems due to its bulkiness and its tendency to bridge in the seed bucket.  In addition, it is anticipated that a majority of the sagebrush seed will have a high moisture content which causes seed to compact, clump, and bridge even more severely.  Therefore, seed bucket(s) or hopper(s) shall include a mechanical agitation system to prevent the seed from bridging in the bucket or hopper.  Equipment that cannot perform the specified work shall be modified or replaced by the Contractor.  Equipment shall be equipped for carrying seed with an approved distribution mechanism complete with release, shutoff, and spreading device, which can be calibrated for spreading seed at the prescribed rate in a satisfactory manner and uniform pattern.  Seed bucket(s) or hopper(s) shall include lids, which fasten securely to prevent seed from blowing out. Seeder Calibration - The Contractor shall calibrate seeding equipment prior to application on the project.  The Government will supply seed for calibration.  However, the seed may not be available until approximately two days prior to the approximate start date of the project.  Seed used for calibration shall be recovered for use on the project. Seed - The seed will be furnished by the Government at the location stated in the detailed specifications.  Contractor shall load and transport seed from the pickup point to the operational loading sites and shall be responsible for its protection from loss or damage due to weather, rodents, insects, theft, or any other hazard.  Any seed damaged or lost, while in the custody of the Contractor, will be replaced by the Government, and actual cost to the Government for replacement will be deducted from payments due the Contractor.  All unused seed shall be returned to the pickup point by the Contractor or nearer destination, if so directed, upon completion of work or termination of the contract.  All empty seed bags shall be tied in bundles of 25 bags each and returned to the Government by the Contractor. Seeding Operation - Rate of seeding - Seed shall be distributed at the rate stated in the detailed specifications, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.  Some seeding rates may be slightly reduced due to availability of seed.  The following is a list of the locations and quantities for the required seeding: Description/Pounds of Seed/Estimated Acres Raven Fire/37,650/11,450 Elephant Head Fire/131,500/12,900 Carico Fire/10,600/2,168 Paris Fire/21,100/1,904 Cain Fire/3,100/1,593 Elephant Fire/2,000/2,188 This is a 100% set-aside for small business.

<DESC>This proposed procurement is a follow-on of a portfolio management application essential to the execution and performance measurement phase of the Office of Education?s portfolio management process and the related support services. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Expert Choice for the Periscope software package in order to align programmatic decisions with Organizational objectives/criteria; implement a structured, repeatable and justifiable decision making approach; leverage organizational expertise; improve top-down and bottom-up communication; develop consensus and buy-in among stakeholders; and create in organizational decisions. In November of 2006, the NASA Office of Education executed a task order under an existing GSA contract to acquire software and related services from Expert Choice. The purpose of the software acquisition was to equip NASA with software that would enable the Office of Education to meet requirements set by the NASA Administrator and the Office of Management and Budget.  The goal was to restructure agency-wide the management and implementation of the entire NASA Education Program. Expert Choice has previously worked closely with NASA Education in the implementation of Expert Choice (the software?the company?s standard prioritization/selection product) to prioritize the 450 projects in the NASA education portfolio, and align them with NASA education outcomes and objectives.  Now that the Prioritization and alignment have been accomplished the next step in the process is to be able to measure and mange project performance.  The company?s Periscope software package provides one centralized interface to measure and manage organization/project portfolio performance.  Periscope is a software package that provides performance management monitoring capabilities for all projects in the NASA education portfolio.	Periscope is a module to be added to the existing performance measurement system which NASA purchased in 2006. No other software product will work with the existing system, which is proprietary to Expert Choice.  The software will allow the Office of Education to have a single entry point for retrieving information on project schedules, benchmarks, key decisional points, relevance and cost for each of the projects.  Periscope will also allow the Office of Education to move to the consolidation phase of its performance measurement process as required by the Office of Management and Budget (OBM) and the Office of the NASA Administrator. NASA/HQ intends to award a purchase order for finalizing the development of our portfolio management measurement application with Periscope software with Expert Choice. The authority is FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(A) ?only one responsible source?. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organization may submit their capabilities and qualification to perform the effort in writing by FAX or E-Mail, to identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m., local  time on December 27, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualification will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to be conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has a requirement to expand the scope of the Raytheon contract HQ0006-06-C-0012 to provide a vehicle to analyze the feasibility and impacts of future Early Warning Radar (EWR) applications for the Missile Defense System.  MDA intends to award a modification to the contract to Raytheon Corporation for this effort.  This contract modification will be under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.3012-1(a)(ii)  only one responsible source.  Raytheon, the developer of the upgrades of the EWRs at Beale, Fylingdales and Thule is the only company that can provide the required studies without significant duplication of costs to the Government.  An award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in performing the required analyses.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Getinge USA, Inc. 325 Channing Lake Dr., Lawrernceville, GA 33043, as the only responsible source that can provide BLUEMMSA Surgical Ceiling Light that is approved for use in mobile ISO shelter structures used in Navy Field medicine. Getinge Surgical lights will be used in deployed medical temporary structures in Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM).

The government intends to create a Requirements type Contract for the Getinge BLUEMMSA Surgical Lights. The resultant contract will not exceed 5 years in duration. The estimated quantity is 52 units over the duration of the contract. However, the government anticipates a delivery order for quantity 8 units will be issued shortly after contract award. Delivery will usually be to Williamsburg, VA.

The following are essential characteristics of the Getinge BLUEMMSA light:

1.	Shall be a ceiling mounted surgical light; Shall be a dual light head operating room light that has a minimum luminance of 80,000 Lux per light head.

2.	The suspension arm shall rotate 360 degree in the tight constraints of the ISO shelter structure and allow for maximum head clearance in the low 7 feet 0 inches ceiling heights. The lights shall not use gas piston arm supports to hold light in position.  The light shall hang down no more than 12 inches, with the lowest point of the suspension no more than 6 feet 0 inches. 

3.	The mount plate shall be specially designed and fabricated to allow the surgical shelter light to attach to the existing mounts in the ISO shelter ceiling. 

4.	The Power supply is specially designed for redundancy in the field with two transformers.  The transformers shall be housed in a Nema enclosure that quickly mounts with quick disconnects for incoming power and low voltage output to the light.  The Power Supply shall be designed to be quickly dismantled and packed away during ISO shelter transport.  The power supply will have 110VAC to 120 VAC 60 Hz single phase incoming power and output power shall range from 24.5 VAC to 27.5 VAC. The power supply and mounting plate of the Getinge BLUEMMSA Light is specially designed to quickly connect to the existing equipment integral to the ISO shelter.

5.	The light kit shall provide all necessary wiring cables and conduits to allow a quick change from the existing operating room lights to the new lights in the field. The installation manual must be specially written to detail the step by step replacement.

6.	Any specialized installation tools necessary for the installation shall be included in the kit.

7.	The light heads and power supply shall be protected within a MIL specified case.  The light heads and transformer can be quickly disconnected and secured in the case.  The kit tools shall also be stored in the case. 

8.	The operating light shall be a cool & shadowless reflector style system. 

9.	The operating room light shall maintain a natural white light, true to tissue color. The Color shall be approximately 4300 Kelvin with a Color Rendering Index (CRI) of approximately 93.

10.	The operating room light shall be easy to focus and light weight when lifting the light head.

11.	The operating room light shall utilize an easy access on/off switch and easy bulb assembly replacement.

12.	The operating room light shall use a removable sterilizable handle to manipulate the light during surgery.

The complete kit for the quick installation dual light system, Getinge BLUEMMSA, is specifically designed for Department of Defense ISO shelters and has been approved by the DMSB (Defense Medical Standardization Board) for the following reasons:

1.	Main Arms Changes:  The upper arm was reduced to the shortest standard arm (Typically the upper would be the longest).  The Lower of the two main light arms were shortened to 27.5 inches and curved upward. These enhancements allowed the suspension to rotate 360 degree in the tight constraints of the ISO shelter structure and allowed the lights to have maximum head clearance in the low  ceiling heights. The spring arm post was also shortened by 3 inches to help head clearance. The lowest point of the suspension is 6 feet 0 inches. 
2.	Ceiling Mount Plate Change:  The mount plate was specially designed and fabricated to allow the BLUEMMSA light to attach to the existing mounts in the ISO shelter ceiling. The plate design maximizes light clearance. 
3.	Power Supply Change: The Power supply was specially designed for redundancy in the field with two transformers.  They are both housed in a Nema enclosure that quickly mounts with quick disconnects for incoming power and low voltage output to the light.  The Power Supply is designed to be quickly dismantled and packed away during ISO shelter transport. 
4.	Wiring conduits and connections: The light kit provides all necessary wiring cables and conduits to allow a quick change from the existing lights to the new lights in the field. The installation manual is specially written to detail the step by step replacement. 
5.	Tools: Specialized installation tools are included in the kit necessary for the installation. 
6.	Hardigg Case enclosure.  The light heads and power supply are protected within a MIL specified case by Hardigg while in transport. The light heads and transformer can be quickly disconnected and secured in the case within a few minutes. The kit tools are also stored in the case. 

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable surgical light is manufactured by Getinge USA.
 
This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 339113 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including price, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by the closing date of this publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word, Excel, or Adobe PDF attachment to Richard Taylor at richard.taylor@med.navy.mil. Statements are due by 1200 (12:00 PM) Eastern Time 09 JAN 08.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, in Key West, FL., intends award a purchase order (base plus 4 option years) for a computer monitoring system, subscription and the administration of two Kiosks located at the Florida Keys Eco-Discovery Center. The Florida Keys Eco-Discovery Center (FKEDC) is an educational facility that can launch visitors on an exploration into the Keys? legacy as an environmental jewel and historical treasure. The Eco-Discovery Center features 6,000 square feet of interactive exhibits on the Florida Keys, with a focus on human interaction with the environment, the management of marine protected areas and the maritime culture and history of the area. Typically at Center?s such as the FKEDC, visitors expect to be able to get information about local businesses (restaurants, stores, etc.) Government employees or volunteers at the information desk may not refer a visitor to a specific business or show preference to a specific business. When asked to make a referral for a service they will direct the visitor to the ?Information and Reservations? kiosk .The goal of the kiosks is to provide a service to the visitors at the FKEDC and relieve staff from being put in a compromising situation of recommending businesses. The government currently has two ?Information and Reservations? kiosks at the FKEDC.

<SUBJECT>66--Establish Basic Ordering Agreements to Machine Parts
<SOLNBR>SB1341-08-RP-0004

<CONTACT>Carol  Wood, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8172, Fax 301-975-8884, Email carol.wood@nist.gov - Todd Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), has a requirement to establish multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) for machining of parts in accordance with NIST provided drawings on an as needed basis.

The NCNR, in pursuing its mission to be a world leading facility for neutron scattering research, services a large and diverse group of outside users.  To that end, it seeks to equip its laboratories with state-of-the-art parts that interface with the equipment and machines that are used to perform this research. 

The NCNR designs, builds, operates and maintains a suite of cold and thermal neutron scattering instrumentation used in the conduct of material structure research. The NCNR is under a new expansion directive that will include the construction of a new Guide Hall.  This Guide Hall will house at least four (4) instrument guides.  

During this expansion phase, the NCNR anticipates the need of machined parts and assemblies in quantities that would exceed NIST?s on-site manufacturing capacity.  The BOAs will provide a mechanism for purchasing completed parts, custom-made to satisfy the parameters and specifications provided by the NCNR.  

While these BOAs will be open to all operating units within NIST, the NCNR shall be the primary user.
	
The Government intends to award multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs).  

The period of performance shall be one year from the date of award with four one year option periods.

These BOAs shall be procured using the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.    

The NAICS code for this requirement is 332710 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under RFP number SB1341-08-RP-0004.

THE RFP IS ANTICIPATED FOR RELEASE TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY ON OR ABOUT DECEMBER 21, 2007, AND WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET AT THE ABOVE WEB SITE.  

POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCESSING THE WEB SITE.  

Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant Basic Ordering Agreement.  

THERE IS NO WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT AVAILABLE, TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED, AND NO BIDDERS LIST WILL BE MAINTAINED. Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via email to Carol.Wood@NIST.GOV.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Evaluation factors include Past Performance, Technical Proposal and Price.  The Government intends to award without discussions, therefore, the offerors initial proposal shall contain its best terms. Since the Air National Guard is seeking to minimize t he risk of alkali silicate reaction (ASR), they will require the following testing procedures and results: ASTM C 1260 and ASTM C 1567 with the following two test conditions: (A) 1N sodium hydroxide at 80 degrees C for 28 days and (B) 6.4N potassium acetat e at 80 degrees C for 28 days. The limits for these tests at 28 days shall not exceed 0.08%. The testing must be done by an independent certified testing compan y. The course aggregates and fine aggregates will be tested in accordance with specification 32.13.11 Concrete Pavements for Airfield and Other Heavy Duty Pavements more than 10,000CY. This section of the specification may be viewed at the following web pa ge: http://www.nationalguardcontracting.org/Ebs/AdvertisedSolicitations.asp. Offerors must include test results and design mix in their proposal. We want to emphasize that passing results for these tests MUST be included with the proposal.  Proposals with test results which do not pass these tests WILL NOT be considered for award.  The MeANG performed ASR screening tests using the protocol prescribed above and found that some coarse aggregates (marble and coarse grained granite) available within a reasonabl e haul distance from the project site meet the screening limits when blended with Class F low lime fly ash (CaO less than 3%) at a cement substitution rate of 25%. The MeANG has also found that some coarse aggregates (quartzite and processed glacial deposi ts) when combined when Class F low lime fly ash at 25% did not pass the screening tests. All four of the local fine aggregate sources tested (glacial deposit) did meet the above-mentioned standard when tested with the addition of 25 % Class F low lime fly ash.

(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, E-Mail Division (IRM/OPS/MSO/EML). This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of StoneGate Equipment and Maintenance. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the StoneGate product as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet.  The equipment listed above is required to replace existing equipment that has reached the end of its life cycle.  The firewalls will continue to aid in the process of filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the Department of State's mission critical operating environment. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure.<BR><BR>

<DESC>KC-10 Cargo Net Elevation Tool (CNET)

  The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to a lighter KC-10 cargo net with integrated hoisting system that will minimize manpower and reduce time necessary to manually raise and secure cargo net during cargo operations.  The system proposed should be low profile, lightweight and integrate with the current cargo net attach points. The new net must meet all current KC-10 G-Ratings.  
  The lifting system must not interfere with the net?s rated cargo restraint capability nor will it reduce the internal contour limitations of the cargo compartment.  Hoist can be manual or motorized but must be able to support the raised cargo net (approximately 235lbs) whenever it is not required to be fully lowered and installed for cargo operations. The new net and integrated lifting system must not weigh more than current net, approximately 235lbs.
This Request for Information (RFI) may be followed by a request for proposal to conduct a Battlelab Concept Demonstration.  All possible offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.

<DESC>Modification 01: For this solicition, DHS PIADC is seeking only castrated male Holsteins.  Therefore, in the bullet point list of criteria below, please change the requirement from "all animals must be...females and/or castrated males" to ""all animals must be...castrated males." [End of Modification 01] 

The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), under the Department of Homeland Security, seeks 40 (forty) healthy head of cattle within the weight range of 350 lbs. to 450 lbs. and all with a 50 lbs. weight differential of each other, to be delivered to Orient Point, New York, on Thursday, January 10, 2008.

For this competitive, best value procurement, Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) certification of the Supplier?s facilities may convey some assurance of an acceptable source.  In addition, the Supplier must ensure and demonstrate that the animals, in particular younger animals, are not overly stressed and fatigued, for instance, as a result of prolonged transportation, which could compromise the animals? immune systems.  Furthermore, in order to minimize any variability between tests, the cattle should come from a homogeneous source without having co-mingled with other cattle.  Any exception to this requirement must be documented and explained.

Prior to departure for Orient Point and PIADC, the Supplier shall verify that each head of cattle has had a veterinary examination along with the appropriate vaccinations (example Bovishield?) and boosters as necessary as well as antibiotics prior to transport to prevent any in transit fever.  Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, each animal shall be issued a health certificate for interstate transportation.  Also, the Supplier shall submit a document with the recent medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments for each animal.  This report shall include, at a minimum, general information identifying the animal by number/ID; the departure date of transport to Orient Point/Plum Island; breed; gender; age or birth date range; (de)horned; weaned; castrated (if applicable); the dates and dosages for vaccines and anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, antibiotic drugs; any other tests and corresponding results; and any other interesting and important information.  Accurate and consistent with the medical history and record of vaccinations and/or treatments mentioned above, all animals must be:

?	Holsteins;
?	females and/or castrated males;
?	healthy with no overt signs of disease;
?	free of active lameness, respiratory disease, warts, or ringworm;
?	polled or dehorned;
?	tolerant of being haltered (i.e. of tractable temperament and be free of behavioral vices such as charging and kicking); and
?	free of external parasites and have been treated for internal parasites within the last three (3) months (preferably using Ivermectin).

Additional requirements are as follows:

?	the cattle must have un-pigmented (i.e ?pink?) tongues;
?	the hooves of the cattle shall be trimmed prior to shipment; and
?	the ears of the cattle shall be notched for Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD).

After notification of award, the Supplier shall deliver (F.O.B. Origin) the cattle, and corresponding documentation to the USDHS/S&T/PIADC Warehouse, 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957 at approximately 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, January 10, 2008.  Utilizing a PIADC-owned wooden animal stockade ramp, available at the Orient Point destination, the Supplier shall offload the cattle from their vehicle then load the animals onto a U.S. Government vehicle.

Once the Supplier hands over the cattle to PIADC personnel at Orient Point, the animals will be quarantined and evaluated for seven (7) calendar days.  Any animal that has been delivered but does not meet the criteria listed above or otherwise is considered by PIADC personnel to be unhealthy will be rejected and euthanized.  PIADC personnel will inform the Supplier and prepare an animal incident report and send it, by fax or e-mail or both, to the Supplier promptly (within approximately three (3) calendar days, if reasonable and practicable).  Unless otherwise agreed to by PIADC and the Supplier, and pending the resolution of any inquires or disputes, the Supplier shall compensate PIADC with an appropriate replacement of cattle for any unacceptable animal(s) following the quarantine and evaluation period.

Please submit your responses before the deadline of 11:59 p.m. on January 3, 2008, to the attention of Ms. Patricia La Riviere-Hom, Contracts Specialist, (Telephone 631-323-3203) via e-mail at patricia.lariviere-hom@dhs.gov, by fax to 631-323-3101, or by mail to Department of Homeland Security, Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), 40550 Route 25, Orient Point, NY 11957.

The successful offeror will be notified by the DHS/OPO/PIADC Procurement Office.

<DESC>Introduction: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), of the United States Department of Transportation, is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths on highways resulting from vehicle crashes.  

Specific Requirements:  NHTSA intends to procure Hydrogen Vehicle fuel System Safety Research of which the objective is to generate data to assess the safety performance of hydrogen fuel cell vehicle fuel systems under similar crash conditions to those prescribed in the existing FMVSS, and to identify and assess any additional life-cycle safety hazards imposed by utilization of these unique propulsion systems.  The contractor shall: 1) provide the facilities, personnel, expertise, material, and equipment necessary to perform fuel system integrity testing and evaluation of hydrogen vehicle fuel systems and fuel system components; 2) prepare a work plan, subject to COTR approval, for conducting safety performance research testing on hydrogen fuel containers, container arrays, packaged fuel systems, purpose built fuel systems (e.g. sleds or modified production vehicles) and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) hydrogen vehicles; 3) have the capability to design and assemble purpose built test articles for evaluation.  An example of such a test article would be the retrofit of a commercially available hybrid electric/gasoline fueled vehicle with a hydrogen fuel system and fuel cell stack for safety testing of the high pressure storage system and postcrash electrical isolation; and 4) propose a research test plan in general accordance with current or proposed hydrogen fuel component/system safety assessment testing. The test plan shall include a test matrix and schedule, based on availability of components, vehicles, and the time required to fabricate test articles when vehicles are not available.

<DESC>The Office of Contract Operations, Major Systems Acquisition Division, of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Headquarters expects to release Request for Proposal (RFP) No. HSCG23-08-R-ADA011 to procure Increment 2 Phase I of the Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS).  The expected release date for the RFP is on or about December 20, 2007.  The USCG contemplates an award of one hybrid type contract.

The NAIS, which uses international standards-based Automatic Identification System (AIS) technology for ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and shore-to-ship communication of navigation information to support Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), is being implemented by the USCG incrementally.  Increment 1, which was completed at the end of FY 2007, is operational and providing receive-only capability in 55 critical ports and 9 coastal areas across the country.  Increment 2, to be implemented over two phases, will establish coastal transmit and receive capability nationwide.  Increment 3 will provide long-range receive capability nationwide.  Phase 2 of Increment 2 and Increment 3 will be the subject of separate procurements.

Increment 2 Phase I, which is the subject of this RFP, involves the work necessary to design, develop and deliver the core NAIS capability, achieve NAIS receive and transmit coverage for three designated Coast Guard Sectors to establish Initial Operational Capability (IOC); and, to provide systems engineering, physical and logical shore stations hardware and software, initial logistics, and Sector coverage design services to support post-IOC deployment towards achieving Full Operational Capability (FOC) or complete receive and transmit coverage.

This core system shall provide all of the necessary I-2 functionality for a fully-capable system, albeit with a limited number of Physical Shore Stations (PSSs) and Logical Shore Stations (LSSs).  The core capability of the NAIS, which is a subset of the IOC, is defined as the following system elements or capabilities:

     ** Centralized storage and enterprise services for the Enterprise Data Center (EDC), to include data storage, data retrieval, and external data capture services, as well as the interfaces to the External Data Providers and External AIS User Systems as described in the PSPEC; 

     ** The AIS Service Management at the System Operations Center (SOC), to include the SOC User Human System Interface as described in the PSPEC; 

     ** Three Physical Shore Stations (PSSs) ? one at Government designated site within Sector Delaware Bay and two at the Coast Guard Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN);

     ** Two Logical Shore Stations (LSSs) ? functionality to be provided at the SOC and  C2CEN;

     ** Both the Sector Command Center User and SOC User Human System Interface components;

     ** Incorporation of Increment 1 AIS data feeds into the EDC; and

     ** All network functions and capabilities associated with connecting these elements into a fully integrated and monitored system that meets the information assurance requirements of the SOW and the PSPEC.

The USCG will be hosting a site visit at the Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, New Jersey on or about January 8, 2008 to familiarize interested Offerors on Government infrastructure relevant to the NAIS procurement.  Presentations will be provided on NAIS/Rescue-21 integration testing, existing Rescue-21 sites within the designated IOC Sectors, Sector Command Centers within the IOC Sectors, NAIS Increment-1 sites within the IOC Sectors and USCG Centers of Excellence, including the Coast Guard Navigation Center (NAVCEN) and the Operations System Center (OSC,  Martinsburg, WV) facilities and capabilities.

In addition, potential Offerors will have the opportunity to visit the Cape May, NJ, Rescue-21 Remote Fixed facility (RFF) where the Coast Guard has conducted an initial assessment of the feasibility and interoperability of collocating NAIS systems at Rescue 21 remote sites.

Potential Offerors interested in attending the site visit must register on the NAIS I-2 RFP Development Website:  www.naisproject.net.  At this time, attendance is limited to two representatives per company.

The NAIS Project Office has established a Technical Library to provide a variety of relevant technical information on system design guidance and existing capabilities.  To view the contents of the Technical Library, Potential Offerors are required to register for access at the following location: http://www.naisproject.net/NAIS_External/NAISDiscussion/tech_registrationform.asp.

Registration requires completing a registration form, signing a non-disclosure agreement, and sending in the non-disclosure agreement via fax or e-mail (if the signed agreement is scanned as a PDF beforehand).  The NAIS Contracting Officer will review submitted registrations.  If approved, a unique username and password will be electronically mailed to the registrant.

<DESC>The Request for Proposal is amended to incorporate the responses to the following questions:

Question 1) In RFP Attachment 3, Statement of Work (SOW), Task 2, reference is made to synthesis and analysis of up to 40 compounds per year with the phrase ?(see page 18, D. Schedule of Work, for year 1 quantities)? included as part of item (1). We note that the SOW Attachment does not have 18 pages. However, under Section D of Attachment 3, reference is made to a total of 25 synthesis in Year 1 with performance during years 2-5 essentially the same as described in Task 1-5. We understand that Task 1 would only be performed by contractors other than the incumbent, and only in Year 1. Since annual funding for years 2-5 can not exceed the amount estimated for Year 1, please clarify whether offerors should base estimates on 40 compounds for Task 2 in all five years of the contract term. 

Answer 1)  The number of compounds  is herby changed from 40 to 25 in Task 1 (SOW), under parenthesis, (first six months 10 compounds and then next six months 15 compounds). You can delete the sentence, "(see page 18. D Schedule of work, for Year 1 quantities)".

Question 2) In RFP Attachment 3, SOW, Task 2, item (5), the last sentence references Task 1, Phase-In. Please confirm that this reference to additional synthesis was intended to apply to the Task 2, Synthesis effort.

Answer 2) Task 2, Item 5.: Yes it applies to Task 2. (that is in addition to 25 compounds).

Question 3) In RFP Attachment 3, SOW, Task 3, can NIDA provide additional information regarding any special requirements for shipping?

Answer 3) Task 3. There is no NIDA specific requirements. Requirements for the shipping of hazardous materials such as radioactive and volatile solvents are regulated by government.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Emergency and Environmental Health Services (EEHS) contemplates award of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract on or about May 1, 2008.  The contemplated contract will have a one-year base period and four, one-year options.  The total estimated ceiling price is $50 Million (approximately $10 Million per year).  Individual task orders may be either firm-fixed-price (FFP) or cost plus fixed fee (CPFF).  The attached draft statement of work describes the requirement in detail.  Included with the draft statement of work are the evaluation criteria and sample task order projects representative of the organization?s anticipated requirements.  Such samples should not be considered a comprehensive representation of all requirements.

1. Capability Statement:  Interested offerors are requested to submit a capability statement to the contracting officer Mr. Lionel (Lee) Nadeau, CDC Procurement and Grants Office, via e-mail at lnadeau@cdc.gov no later than January 25, 2007.  The capability statement should, as a minimum, address the following topics:

a.	Describe your organization?s experiences which relate to the statement of work occurring during the previous three years from the date of this synopsis.  Briefly explain the relationship to the draft statement of work. The attached project samples may also be considered for purposes of identifying and describing relevant experience.

b.	Describe the breadth and scope of technical expertise and experience relative to the 12 primary tasks identified in paragraph C of the draft statement of work.
c.	Describe your organization?s capacity to support the diverse needs described in the draft statement of work.

Describe the depth and breadth of the personnel expertise within your organization as related to the requirements described in the draft statement of work.
d.	Explain your organization?s ability to quickly identify appropriate technical personnel that may not be available from within your organization.  If possible, provide specific examples of successful accomplishments that demonstrate timely responses to provide technical personnel outside your organization upon short notice.  

Respondents are cautioned that ?standard? marketing brochures may not provide sufficient and specific information to enable the government to evaluate an offeror?s capabilities relative to the contemplated requirement (as reflected in the draft statement of work) and thus offerors should tailor the capability statement accordingly.  The capability statement is limited to 10 pages.  

2. Comments to Draft Statement of Work and Evaluation Criteria:  in addition to submitting a capability statement, offerors are invited to submit comments to the draft statement of work and evaluation criteria.  Due to time constraints and limited resources, the government does not  intend to respond to specific questions at this time but will consider comments and questions received in developing the final statement of work and evaluation criteria.

3. Business Size Status: The government will evaluate responses to this sources sought synopsis to determine the acquisition strategy (e.g. full and open competition versus a set aside).  Accordingly, offerors are requested to indicate their business size status relative to the NAICS code 541690 $6.5 Million and indicate any other applicable socio-economic business subcategory status (e.g. HUBZone, Small Disadvantage Business etc.).

Offerors? responses should be divided into three, distinct sections as follows:  1. Capability Statement; 2. Comments to Draft Statement of Work (as applicable); 3.  Business Size status.  

This sources sought synopsis does not obligate the government and is submitted as market research for acquisition planning purposes.  Offerors responding to this synopsis do so voluntarily and assume all costs incurred in preparing and submitting such response.  This synopsis is not a solicitation and therefore formal proposals are neither requested nor required.  Thus the CDC will reject any such proposals received in response to this sources sought synopsis.

<RESPDATE>010208
<ARCHDATE>12202008
<CONTACT>RAFFAELA SMITH CHIEF, SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS 7036487388     RMSMITH@USGS.GOV;
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Department of the Interior, is a science based organization with approximately 10,000 employees located at roughly 400 field offices.  USGS Headquarters is the largest facility and is based in Reston, VA. Each USGS location is typically connected into a common WAN backbone (Verizon Business VBNS+ VPN) at no less than T1 (1.5Mbps) speeds. The Reston HQ has at least an OC3(155Mbps) connection into the WAN backbone as do other key locations including Menlo Park, CA, Denver, CO and Sioux Falls, SD. Currently multicast is not enabled on the WAN backbone nor is Quality of Service (QOS).  The USGS desires to deploy a live streaming audio/video application.  The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a live audio/video broadcast of various content to all USGS employees simultaneously at their desktop via the USGS Intranet. As an interim goal, they would like to be able to send one live stream to each of the 400 field locations simultaneously via the USGS Intranet.  The secondary goal of this project is to provide employees access to archived presentations and to conduct live streaming presentations to the public over the common Internet.  INFORMATION REQUESTED: The primary intent of this RFI is to identify current and future industry standards-based solutions to broadcast live streaming audio/video presentations as well as the capability to store archived presentations and stream those as needed.  This capability must scale to serve these presentations to all USGS employees across the USGS Intranet as well as to the public community over the Internet without severely impacting a particular site's bandwidth and its ability to perform its mission.  Please provide the following information and specifications: - Solutions that are Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS). - Solutions that are standards based and which can perform both unicast and multicast functions. - Description of any potential network constraints (WAN/LAN) that must be considered prior to deploying such an application, including QOS provisioning as well as provisioning multicast on both LAN and WAN infrastructure.   - Solutions that can accommodate both live streaming and archived audio/video downloads. - Solutions that have the capability to control bandwidth or delivery speeds per stream (adaptive bandwidth controls).  -  Solutions that have the capability for various frame rates, color depths, and resolutions. -  Solutions that support various video formats such as: MPEG, Real-Video (RM, RAM), AVI, WMV, ASF, ASX, QuickTime (MOV), FlashVideo (SWF/FLV) and/or other video format standards that are not inclusive in this list that are preferred and why. -  Solutions that support various audio formats such as: MP3, AAC, OGG, Real-Audio, WMA and/or other audio standards that are not inclusive in this list that are preferred and why. -  Description of standard protocols, what the preferred standard is, and why.  -  Solutions that can accommodate and scale to enough streams to service the entire USGS.   -  Specifications of any and all necessary hardware and software such as servers, recommended operating system platforms, memory and hard-drives, cameras, control devices, and capture and recording devices required to produce and store broadcasts. -  Which solutions could be portable, i.e., installed on a movable cart to be used in several locations. -  Recommendation for the preferred (standards based) viewer software/client such as: Real Player, Windows Media Player etc. and why. -  Descriptions of the functions and capabilities of the system that comply with the Federal Government's Section 508 Accessibility law (such as captioning etc.) -  Availability of training for up to 10 USGS employees on operation of system -  Availability of maintenance and service contracts as well as technical support. This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bids, a request for proposal (RFP), a solicitation, a request for quote (RFQ) or an indication that the government will contract for items provided by the submitter. This RFI is for planning purposes only.  The government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with the preparation or submission of the information requested nor for the government's use of that information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the government's assessment of the information received.  No basis for claims against the government shall arise as a result of response to this request for information, or in the government's use of such information as either part of a USGS evaluation process or in developing any subsequent policy or announcement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) is planning to award a contract for a program entitled, 'Development of the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)'.  This sources sought announcement is presented in an effort to locate small businesses with the ability to perform the requirements of the program.  ONLY SMALL BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

The Contractor will work with NCI program staff and with NCI-sponsored clinical trial networks to develop the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of symptom elements that are contained within the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).  The Contractor must be able to support the development of an electronic-based and psychometrically-robust patient-reported outcome version of the symptomatic adverse events (AE) to complement the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).  

The ideal PRO-CTCAE will: 1) be comprehensive to capture a range of symptoms and functioning that enhances monitoring of adverse events; 2) have minimal burden on the patient in terms of survey length and comprehension; 3) be adaptable for translation into multiple languages to accommodate the diversity of patients who participate in NCI-sponsored clinical trials; 4) include both paper and electronic administration; 5) be fully integrated and complement the revised CTCAE (version 4.0); 6) meet the standards of compatibility within the CaBIG specifications; and 7) have minimal administrative burden for health care providers who will collect and interpret data for reporting adverse events and for informing patient care.  The contract proposal will also validate the PRO-CTCAE and demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the system within NCI-sponsored trials.  

It is anticipated that a resulting contract will utilize a phasing approach.

Phase I
Identify Barriers and Ideal Conditions to Develop, Implement, and Validate the PRO-CTCAE in Cancer Clinical Trials
Develop the PRO-CTCAE assessment system fully integrated with the CTCAE reporting system

Phase II (Option)
Evaluate the validity, reliability, and feasibility and clinical utility of the new PRO-CTCAE within the NCI clinical trials network.
Create Training Materials to Support the PRO-CTCAE


The NCI intends to award a cost-reimbursement contract for a one-year base period of performance on or about 9/30/2008. The contract will also contain the FAR provisions for the consideration of the optional Phase II task.  

All capability statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Elizabeth B. Dean, Contract Specialist, at deane@mail.nih.gov  in either MS Word, Wordperfect or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by 3:00 PM EST on January 23, 2008.

The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, facilities, and services in support of the efforts.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) starting in December 2008 with a one year Base Period and four Optional Periods of 12 months each.  Approximately 15,000 LOE hours are anticipated for each contract period with contractor?s needing to provide as much as an additional 15,000 hours for a total of 150,000 hours in total for all periods if all the potential LOE hours are realized.  The applicable NAICS code is 541690 with a size standard of $6,500,000.   In the previous acquisition, EPA restricted the following types of firms from receiving award due to an inherent conflict of interest posed by the implications of the products to be produced under the contract:  firms that were chemical producers/importers; pesticide or agricultural products producers/importers; and waste management/ waste disposal firms. Any interested firms should submit a capability statement which demonstrates the firm?s ability to perform the key requirements described above.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified Hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern.   The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses if it determines that there are two or more small businesses able to compete in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery.  If set aside, a small business would be required to perform at least 50 percent of the direct labor costs incurred under the contract with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14).  Capability statements from small businesses should address their ability to meet this requirement.  Responses to the above should be submitted to David Plagge, USEPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH 45268, or plagge.david@epa.gov) no later than 21 calendar days from date of posting.  A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources source synopsis. The EPA is also interested in soliciting ideas that firms may have as to the appropriate means of incentivizing contractor performance from a contractor?s perspective.  Firms may provide suggestions for EPA consideration as to appropriate performance incentives.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Emergency and Environmental Health Services (EEHS) contemplates award of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract on or about May 1, 2008.  The contemplated contract will have a one-year base period and four, one-year options.  The total estimated ceiling price is $50 Million (approximately $10 Million per year).  Individual task orders may be either firm-fixed-price (FFP) or cost plus fixed fee (CPFF).  The attached draft statement of work describes the requirement in detail.  Included with the draft statement of work are the evaluation criteria and sample task order projects representative of the organization?s anticipated requirements.  Such samples should not be considered a comprehensive representation of all requirements.

1. Capability Statement:  Interested offerors are requested to submit a capability statement to the contracting officer Mr. Lionel (Lee) Nadeau, CDC Procurement and Grants Office, via e-mail at lnadeau@cdc.gov no later than January 25, 2007.  The capability statement should, as a minimum, address the following topics:

a.	Describe your organization?s experiences which relate to the statement of work occurring during the previous three years from the date of this synopsis.  Briefly explain the relationship to the draft statement of work. The attached project samples may also be considered for purposes of identifying and describing relevant experience.  Identify the period of contract performance and dollar value of the contract for the experiences submitted.
b.	Describe the breadth and scope of technical expertise and experience relative to the 10 primary tasks identified in the draft statement of work.
c.	Describe your organization?s capacity to support the diverse needs described in the draft statement of work.  What specific resources does your organization have available to support the requirement?  Describe the depth and breadth of the personnel expertise within your organization as related to the requirements described in the draft statement of work.
d.	Explain your organization?s ability to quickly identify appropriate technical personnel that may not be available from within your organization.  If possible, provide specific examples of successful accomplishments that demonstrate timely responses to provide technical personnel outside your organization upon short notice.  

Respondents are cautioned that ?standard? marketing brochures may not provide sufficient and specific information to enable the government to evaluate an offeror?s capabilities relative to the contemplated requirement (as reflected in the draft statement of work) and thus offerors should tailor the capability statement accordingly.  The capability statement is limited to 10 pages.  

2. Comments to Draft Statement of Work and Evaluation Criteria:  in addition to submitting a capability statement, offerors are invited to submit comments to the draft statement of work and evaluation criteria.  Due to time constraints and limited resources, the government does not  intend to respond to specific questions at this time but will consider comments and questions received in developing the final statement of work and evaluation criteria.

3. Business Size Status: The government will evaluate responses to this sources sought synopsis to determine the acquisition strategy (e.g. full and open competition versus a set aside).  Accordingly, offerors are requested to indicate their business size status relative to the NAICS code 541690 $6.5 Million and indicate any other applicable socio-economic business subcategory status (e.g. HUBZone, Small Disadvantage Business etc.).

Offerors? responses should be divided into three, distinct sections as follows:  1. Capability Statement; 2. Comments to Draft Statement of Work (as applicable); 3.  Business Size status.  

This sources sought synopsis does not obligate the government and is submitted as market research for acquisition planning purposes.  Offerors responding to this synopsis do so voluntarily and assume all costs incurred in preparing and submitting such response.  This synopsis is not a solicitation and therefore formal proposals are neither requested nor required.  Thus the CDC will reject any such proposals received in response to this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy (DoN), Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) (www.cnic.navy.mil), is conducting preliminary planning to determine whether competitive sourcing, under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A -76 (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_incl_tech_correction.html) and consistent with the President?s Management Agenda (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf), is the optimal methodology for sourcing the issuance of Common Access Cards (CAC) and Teslin Cards via the Real-Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS) presently performed by military, civilian, and contractor personnel at CNIC Pay/Personnel Administrative Support System Services (PASS) Personnel Support Detachments (PSD) and Customer Support Detachments (CSD) and CNIC Installation Security Department Pass & ID Offices throughout the United States.  A tentative list of PASS PSD/CSD and Security Department RAPIDS Site locations, which are subject to further refinement under the current OMB Circular A-76 preliminary planning effort, is set forth in Attachment 1. 

 This Request for Information (RFI), which is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise pay for the information solicited, is intended to seek industry assistance in determining whether there is sufficient industry interest and demonstrated capability to compete for these activities to support a decision to pursue competitive sourcing as the strategic sourcing solutions.  Please note that this market research is a follow-on to that originally posted via FedBizOpps.Gov on 13 Jun 07 (reference number N69450-07-R-0568) in which CAC/Teslin issuance was originally included in the overall scope of the Pay/Personnel Administrative Support System Services (PASS) study but has since, for programmatic reasons, been separated as it?s own study under OMB Circular A-76.  Only United States Citizens, as defined by DOD 5200.2-R, are authorized to issue CAC and Teslin Cards via RAPIDS and must undergo and receive a favorable National Agency Check with Law Check and Credit (NACLC)/Access National Agency Check with Inquiries (ANACI) prior to performing the issuance function.  Interested parties are requested to complete and return via email the Attachment 2 CNIC CAC/Teslin Market Research Questionnaire no later than 4:00 PM Eastern, 3 Jan 08.  E-mail responses should be sent to the attention of the Contracting Officer, Ms. Candice Borden, at candice.borden@navy.mil.  If you have questions concerning this RFI, please contact Ms. Borden at 843-820-5945.  Your participation in this market research endeavor is greatly appreciated and will be instrumental in assisting CNIC in making the right competitive sourcing decision.

<DESC>The Government is seeking potential offerors for the rapid development and deployment of a rifle-mountable rangefinder for the M320 Grenade Launcher Module (GLM). Vendors are requested to provide information to the U.S. Army Product Manager Soldier S ensors and Lasers (PM SSL). The GLM will provide an improved capability to range and engage targets from 31 to 350 meters day and night. The GLM grenadier will have the capability to point to targets for other members of the squad to distances out to 800 m eters.  <BR><BR>Information on the XM320 can be found here: <BR>http://www.peosoldier.army.mil/factsheets/SW_IW_M320.pdf<BR><BR>For more images of an M4 carbine equipped with a GLM and associated day/night sight, please contact Ms. McCoy Klink, telephone ( 703) 704-0035, email mccoy.klink@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Key requirements for the GLM pertaining to its associated rangefinder are that the subsystem provide a weapon-mounted range determination capability out to 800 meters with a measurement accuracy of ? 3 me ters. The rangefinder should at least provide repeatable and accurate range determination capability for man-sized targets out to 200 meters and tank-sized targets out to 300 meters.<BR><BR>The Armys intent is to procure a rangefinder for grenadiers that is mountable on an M4 carbine equipped with the GLM and associated day/night sight. The rangefinder should be backward-compatible with the legacy M203 grenade launcher system. The rangefinder shall minimize weight impact to the Soldier. Cost, size, weight,  and ergonomics are critical to the rangefinder program. As such, PM SSL will consider any configuration which will fit on the limited MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail space on the M4 not already occupied by the GLM itself or the day/night sight, primarily on  the top rail, including stand-alone systems or systems integrated into other equipment (day sights, aiming lights, etc.) common to the M4 carbine. <BR><BR>The solution procured shall be a commercial-off-the-shelf or non-developmental item. There is a pote ntial to procure 72,000 rangefinder systems beginning in FY09.<BR><BR>The Government requests information on any materiel solutions for this rangefinder, including cost to develop, unit cost, and schedule including delivery date after receipt of order. <BR ><BR>Point of contact for this action is Ms. McCoy Klink, telephone (703) 704-0035, email mccoy.klink@us.army.mil.

<DESC>A. General Information. <BR><BR>The Northwest Region TRBO Region 11, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 8 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in Washington and Alaska announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Surgical Drains. <BR><BR>The product line consists primarily of: sterile drains, to include end-and mid-perforated, flat, round, sump, PVC, silicone, closed (such as Jackson-Pratt type) and open (such  as Penrose).  Sterile drain/reservoir combinations, with or without trocars; reservoir types should include those with high or low negative pressure.  Standardized products will be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. <BR><BR>The primary objecti ve of this program is to standardize products or product lines obtaining the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price based on volume pricing discounts utilizing a best value determination process. <BR><BR>The secondary objectiv e of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match  product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included i n a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Region include but are not limited to: Basset Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK 99703; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA 98312-5000; Fairchild AFB C linic,Fairchild AFB, WA 99011-8701; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK 99702; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK 99506-3620; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA 98431-5000; McChord AFB Clinic, McChord AFB, WA 98438-1150; Oak Harbor Naval  Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA 98278-8800<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must ha ve, or be in process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor (Cardinal Health).  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR ><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated selection date is April 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, c linical, and pricing factors. The Technical/ Company and Clinical/ Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical results become more equal, price becomes more im portant. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or  more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability<BR> <BR>Point of Contact: Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at (253) 968-0898; Email - patricia.cordier@us.army.mil<BR><BR>B. Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Northwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Drains. The product line consists primarily of: ste rile drains, to include end-and mid-perforated, flat, round, sump, PVC, silicone, closed (such as Jackson-Pratt type) and open (such as Penrose). Sterile drain/reservoir combinations, with or without trocars; reservoir types should include those with high or low negative pressure.. At a minimum this product line includes the following high volume usage items: <BR><BR>VALVE HEIMLICH CHEST DRAIN<BR>DRAIN HUBLESS EVACUATOR 100CC SILICONE<BR>EVACUATOR LICONE 100 CC STERILE<BR>EVACUATOR MINI HEMOVAC 100ML<BR>DRA IN PENROSE 18X1 IN STER OPAQ RUBBER<BR>DRAIN PENROSE 18X1 IN STER OPAQ RUBBER<BR>DRAIN SILICONEFLAT X-RAY OPAQUE STRL<BR>JP 400CC KIT W/10FR SIL W/TRO<BR>JACKSON PRATT 7MM FLAT DRAIN FULL PERF<BR>DRAIN BLAKE SILICONE 10MM<BR><BR>The Regions estimated annu al demand for this product line, based on PV purchases for the previous 12 months is: Northwest Region: - Total $55,954<BR><BR>Upon request, vendors will provide no cost samples, on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinica l use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, pricing information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information on products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C. Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>This process will incl ude vendor electronic responses to technical criteria & product literature, upon request no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and upon request submission of electronic pricing quotes. DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization i nitiative, email your:<BR><BR>1.   Company name and address<BR><BR>2.   POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, (we suggest more than one POC)<BR><BR>3.   Your responses the technical criteria below to patricia.cordier@us.army.mil no later than Close of Business (COB) 4:00PM PST TBD (five weeks after the FBO is posted).<BR><BR>4.   Please email product literature only to: Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at patricia.cordier@us.army.mil<BR><BR>5.   The TRBO will request that vendors send the no cos t sample set directly to participating MTFs, the TRBO will provide addresses at that time. <BR><BR>Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.<BR>	<B R>D. Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board for the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Region. They are th e deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in th is announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company criteria listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northwest Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during t he evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit efficient competition among vendors. <BR><BR>Phase I Plan: Technical/ Company Evaluation:  <BR><BR>1.	The sources sought notice will be posted to the F BO for a period of five weeks. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of Close of Business (COB) 4:00PM PST listed on the FBO for responding to the announcement will be disqualified from further consideration. Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO point of contact that their response and literature act ually arrived at the Region via email. We strongly recommend that vendors confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission. <BR><BR>2.	At the 3 week mark if response has been  less than anticipated, all vendors with current usage for the product line in the Region will be contacted via email. (2 week notice)<BR><BR>3.	Vendors respond to the FBO announcement by e-mail stating their interest in participating in the standardizatio n process, addressing the technical/company criteria, and providing literature about the products to the POC listed on the announcement. <BR><BR>4.	Vendor replies should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company requirements liste d in this announcement. <BR><BR>5.	The TRBO team will compile the technical/company criteria responses and send to the CPT for review.<BR><BR>6.	The CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and which vend ors are disqualified based on their responses to the technical/company criteria. Generally, responses to the following criteria demonstrate that: <BR><BR>(1) the vendor offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of Surgical Drai ns <BR><BR>(2) based on the vendors responses, the Region has reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services<BR><BR>(3) the vendor has, o r is obtaining a DAPA for the items<BR><BR>(4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region<BR><BR>(5) the vendor offers discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standar dization initiative <BR><BR>(6) the vendors information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)<BR><BR>7.	The vendors who meet the technical/company criteria will be invit ed to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process.<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted criteria: <BR>     <BR>1.	Vendor is required to pro vide a full range of open and closed surgical drains.  Please list the types, brands, and sizes of drains available from your company, to include sterile drain and reservoir combinations.  Drain types should include end- and mid-perforated, flat and round,  sump, PVC and silicone.  Reservoir types should include those with high or low negative pressure.  Please note that additional requirements may become required items of supply in the future.  Overall a complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requ irements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  See DMMonline for the statement of work .  <BR><BR>2.	Vendors that do not meet the following criteria will be disqualified:<BR>	a. Vendor must have a DAPA for this product group (provide DAPA number).<BR>	b. Vendor must have a distribution agreement with Cardinal Health, the regions prime vendo r.  Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health.<BR>	c. Vendor must offer committed volume discounts off their DAPA price for this product group.<BR><BR>3.	Identify which surgical drains in your product line that ha ve a radiopaque indicator. (Depending on the application, it is sometimes necessary to verify drain placement on X-ray.) <BR><BR>4.	Regional Supply Servicing Re quirements:  Required elements include a distribution network that allows products to reach the Prime Vendor Distribution Center in sufficient quantities to meet the regional demand history in a timely manner.  In addition, vendors must also have vendor re presentation sufficient to provide product implementation services and inservicing to all eight facilities in the region.  Please state your plan for providing the above services.  <BR><BR>5.	Vendors must provide a standard industry warranty, at a minimum,  Please provide your companys returned goods policy. <BR><BR>6.	Detail any history of backorders and/or recalls for this product group.  Please include: (a) Dates and duration, (b) Cause, (c) Resolution. If there is no history of back orders or recalls, s o state.<BR><BR>Phase II Plan: Clinical/ Performance Evaluation:<BR><BR>1.	Using their clinical expertise, the CPT will develop a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set is based on advances in technology and/ or patient safety, and on historical usage for the product line.<BR><BR>2.	The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date. Each vendor will send the samples directly to the par ticipating MTFs. Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process. Due to the potential for samples to become lost, the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO point of contact tha t their samples actually arrived at the MTFs via email. We strongly recommend that vendors confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first shipment.<BR><BR>3.	The CPT will evaluate the p roduct against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or 'no'; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or 'yes'; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations. The CPT has set a threshold of 3.1 for clinical acceptability for standardization. The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.1 depending on the 'break' in t he average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the clinical acceptability target threshold of 3.1.  Below this threshold, products will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization. <BR><BR >4.	Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and/or teaching material prior to the clinical evaluation for facilities in the Northwest Region<BR><BR>5.	Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to t he CPT/TPRB members in the Northwest Region for review.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted criteria:      <BR><BR>1.	Sterile packaging allows the prod uct to be aseptically delivered to the sterile field.<BR><BR>2.	Product packaging readily identifies whether the item contains latex.<BR><BR>3.	Product is easy to assemble for use during surgery (limited number of steps, intuitive procedure, takes little t ime, can be accomplished with gloved hands).<BR><BR>4.	Reservoir is easy to activate for use (takes little time, requires minimal force, can be accomplished with gloved hands). <BR><BR>5.	Trocars (provided with drains) are sharp and penetrate tissue readil y.<BR><BR>6.	Emptying reservoir requires simple, intuitive steps.<BR><BR>7.	Post-operative emptying and re-activating of reservoirs takes little time, follows simple steps, and allows for safe handling of contaminants.<BR><BR>8.	Reservoirs have accurate vo lume gradations (tested by instilling a known and independently-measured quantity of liquid into reservoir and checking accuracy of gradations).   <BR>  <BR>9.	 Reservoirs have easily-readable volume gradations (gradations can be seen at a glance, markings are clear).<BR><BR>Phase III Plan: Pricing Analysis: <BR><BR>1.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization/ Conversion Costs), (2) Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs (i.e. potential for inventory reduction) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the im pact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.   <BR><BR>2.	Vendors who meet the clinical acceptability threshold considering the 'break' will be asked to submit pricing for analysis. 14 calendar days from the da te of the request will be allowed for responses in the requested format. Vendors that do not meet the deadline and those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from consideration. Due to the potential for email to become lost in tran smission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO point of contact that their pricing actually arrived at the Region via email. We strongly recommend that vendors confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re -submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.<BR><BR>3.	The TRBO will conduct a price analysis. The Regio n intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's  best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is  determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>4.	The price analysis will be sent to the Northwest Region TPRB for review. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible (3) three one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<BR><BR>5.	Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price. As the technical and clinical results become more equal, price becomes a determinant. <BR><BR>6.	The TPRB reviews the data for acceptable performance and price analysis.<BR><BR>7.	The Designated Senior Logistician (DSL) will ensure that the offered prices in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment will be a good value considering the costs associated with standardization, operational impact, and regional clinical preferences.<BR><BR>8.	The TPRB selects a vendor(s) for standardization.<BR>

Consortium members will participate with their Government counterparts through  four working groups to plan and adjust the Joint Ground Robotics Enterprises  annual research plan.  These working groups will focus on four of the  Departments Joint Capability Areas: Battlespace Awareness, Force Application,  Protection and Logistics.  It is expected that consortium members will provide  input on a wide array of technologies, to include interoperability, mobility,  autonomy, sensors, manipulators, payloads and collaborative operations. The purpose of this event is to increase awareness of opportunities for  entering into Other Transaction Agreements among researchers and developers in  Academia, Industry and Government. The following information and opportunities  will be available to attendees: -	Overview of the Ground Robotics efforts and each of the Department of  Defenses four Joint Capability areas -	Preview of the Ground Robotics Broad Agency Announcement topics ($150M  total available for funding FY08-FY16 projects) -	Other Transaction and proposal requirements No sensitive or classified information will be discussed. Foreign-owned,  controlled, or influenced firms are advised that security restrictions may  apply that may preclude their participation in these efforts.

<DESC>Only authorized resellers of McCabe IQ annual software maintenance products should reply to this posting. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541519.  The NGA plans to issue a firm fixed price purchase order under FAR Part 12 and 13.     The requirement is for the following items:

1) Annual Maintenance of 56 McCabe IQ perpetual software licenses (Part Number M-IQ-SERVER).  The period of performance for maintenance shall be 01 Feb 2008 through 31 Jan 0009.  

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:    

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has a requirement for annual software maintenance as outlined above. All of the products referenced in this posting are proprietary products of McCabe. The McCabe suite of software products have already been integrated into the NGA enterprise. Due to this fact, it would be extremely costly to switch to a new type of software. Personnel would have to be trained to use the new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to the implementation of the software. The McCabe IQ suite of products is the only software suite that fulfills the form, fit, and function requirements of the NGA at this time.      

Delivery is FOB Destination.     Delivery will be made to:     NGA Arnold, 3838 Vogel Rd., Arnold, MO 63010-6238.

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(b) Responsibility for supplies. 
(1) Title to the supplies passes to the Government upon delivery to? 
(i) A post office or common carrier for shipment to the specific destination; or

(c) Preparation of invoice.

(i) Prepare an invoice as provided in this contract, order, or blanket purchase agreement; and 
(ii) Display prominently on the invoice ?FAST PAY.? Invoices not prominently marked ?FAST PAY? via manual or electronic means may be accepted by the payment office for fast payment. If the payment office declines to make fast payment, the Contractor shall be paid in accordance with procedures applicable to invoices to which the Fast Payment clause does not apply. 
(2) If the purchase price excludes the cost of transportation, the Contractor shall enter the prepaid shipping cost on the invoice as a separate item. The Contractor shall not include the cost of parcel post insurance. If transportation charges are stated separately on the invoice, the Contractor shall retain related paid freight bills or other transportation billings paid separately for a period of 3 years and shall furnish the bills to the Government upon request. 
(3) If this contract, order, or blanket purchase agreement requires the preparation of a receiving report, the Contractor shall either?

(i) Ship-To Point. (ii) Mark-For Point. 
(iii) FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP document number, if in the contract. 
(5) Where a receiving report is not required, the Contractor shall include a copy of the invoice in each shipment.

(e) FAST PAY container identification. The Contractor shall mark all outer shipping containers ?FAST PAY? When outer shipping containers are not marked ?FAST PAY,? the payment office may make fast payment. If the payment office declines to make fast payment, the Contractor shall be paid in accordance with procedures applicable to invoices to which the Fast Payment clause does not apply. 
(End of clause)  
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1: Caterpillar part and no other manufacturer/distributor source will satisfy Coast Guard requirement.

STATEMENT OF WORK  OA MOSS (Studio One) Specialized IP/TV Video Broadcast and Video Engineering, Systems Engineering, Integration, Maintenance, Parts Repair/Replacements, Performance testing, Installation and Training Support Services Background US EPA requires highly specialized broadcast video engineering support services, equipment repair and replacement needed to keep its mobile and studio based broadcast and post production facility operating 24/7. The Office of the Administrator, Multimedia Operations and Services Staff (MOSS) operates EPA's IPTV Video Broadcasts, Studio One and soon Studio Two (for radio/podcasting) and provides video services among other services to the Offices of the Administrator. At present, Studio One records, broadcasts over IPTV, EPA Channels 11 and 13, send and receives video to and from Verizon?s Audio Visual Operation Center (AVOC), re-broadcasts incoming IP video and conduct live, remote and post captioning of video. EPA's IPTV reaches approximately 17,000 desktops across the nation over its wide area network. Studio One's post-production and film-making services depends on its multiple editing suites and legacy video archives. The Video Archive stock tapes are being converted to digital format. EPA Studio One Control Room is connected by multimode fiber to 12 EPA HQ campus rooms through its 40 x 40 routing matrix switcher and jack fields mobile broadcast production racks link with live video and intercom during regular EPA events. Studio One is located at 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., Ariel Rios North Building, Washington DC Room 6330. Managing and maintaining Studio One services and its Control Room has become increasingly complex with its multiple overlapping functions and on going efforts to move from analog to digital. The recent jump to digital studio cameras and robotic pan/tilt and pedestal controls is an example of the nature of continuing equipment integration. Keeping Studio One operational while updating control systems requires part-time engineering support to handle recent changes, fine tune day to day operations, increase quality assurance, and keep Studio One compatible with the Television industry standards. The main purpose of this support contract is to continue integration of existing legacy analog video and audio and newly procured digital video, audio, web-based multimedia and video conference equipment.  EPA Studio One is on the path to become digital by the year 2009 meeting federal requirement for all TV production and transmission to be digital.  It is critical that EPA maintain legacy hardware and its compatibility with new media technology. Other equally important purposes of this contract include engineering support for periodic performance testing, and calibration of studio systems prior to and/or during major EPA events, the service and repair of video systems and training of EPA staff as new system/equipment are installed.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine to procure software from Collexis, Inc., Five Concourse Parkway, Suite 3000, Atlanta, Georgia, 30328-7106, on a sole source basis for the National Institutes of Health, Office of Portfolio Analysis and Strategic Initiatives (OPASI).  
 
An integral function of the OPASI is to identify and facilitate the development of resources that would help the NIH?s IC?s in managing their large and complex scientific portfolios. Currently, Collexis is assisting OPASI with that function by supporting the development of the RCDC enterprise information system, an ongoing NIH wide multi-million dollar project. The RCDC enterprise software application is being developed with the intent of distributing the application across the NIH and integrating it within the various NIH Institutes and Centers.  Because of their extensive knowledge of the NIH and their inimitable expertise of the Collexis software engine, OPASI seeks a sole source task with Collexis to continue providing support and maintenance on the existing NIH wide contract that is responsible for implementing the RCDC enterprise information system.   
 
Immediate interoperability and intimate knowledge of the NIH is critical for the successful scheduled rollout of the RCDC enterprise information system. More specifically, Collexis is the creator the software engine and has the only required expertise to support RCDC through development to deployment. We strongly believe that Collexis is distinctively positioned to assist the NIH in continued development of this technology, not only for the RCDC system but for NIH wide enterprise and IC specific data and text mining solutions.  Therefore, Collexis has been identified as the only vendor that fully supports the text mining matching process and the current software engine that is being used to develop the RCDC enterprise information system.
 
The selection of a different vendor to provide continued support of the Collexis software engine, would delay development and create a timeline risk in the scheduled deployment of the RCDC enterprise information system. This impediment would possibly result from delays involving; training the new vendor on the functionality of the RCDC application and the Collexis engine, understanding interoperability issues, and acquiring essential knowledge of the NIH. 
 
The RCDC enterprise information system is currently on schedule and within 1 year of its deployment date. Therefore, it is imperative that Collexis be retained to support the Collexis software engine and provide required maintenance of the RCDC enterprise system thus allowing the NIH to comply with the requirements stipulated in the NIH Reauthorization act of 2006. 

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items. A Request for Quotations (RFQ) for RFQ-NLM 08-049 is not available. Organizations interested in responding to this requirement must submit your software product to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention:  Em?Ria J. Briscoe, Contracts Specialist, at briscoee@mail.nih.gov.       Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-450-08

<DESC>EPA's Tampa Bay Region Ecosystem Services Research Program:
Opportunities for Collaboration

OPPORTUNITY:  
Tampa Bay is a major focus of EPA's Ecological Research Program because of its unique, sensitive ecosystems, highly urbanized economic centers of commerce and development, extensive eco-tourism areas, and projected rapid growth in population, industry, agriculture, and infrastructure.

The EPA is inviting partners to collaborate in quantifying the services that terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the Tampa Bay region supply to society, and how these services depend upon anthropogenic stressors and location in the landscape. The research will address the cumulative economic and social values of ecosystem services in the context of existing and proposed environmental policies and decisions. Our goal is a comprehensive, spatially and temporally dynamic decision support system designed in cooperation with Tampa Bay regional partners. 

We invite interested organizations, public or private, to participate in this challenging research as partners with EPA in a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). 

TO INDICATE INTEREST:  
Please reply to Frances Richards at Richards.frances@epa.gov or 919-541-3453 by March 1, 2008 if you would like to express an interest in partnering on this CRADA. For more information on CRADAs please see the website: http://www.epa.gov/osp/ftta.htm or contact Dr. Ray Wilhour by phone at 850-934-9213 or email Wilhour.ray@epa.gov.

OVERVIEW:  
Society needs scientifically sound tools to estimate the values of services provided by healthy, intact, sustainable ecosystems and how these services and values affect human health and welfare. Lacking these tools, environmental managers cannot balance the needs for population, economic, and associated infrastructure expansion against the true costs of resulting changes in the environment. As a result, cost-benefit analyses generally have undervalued gains and losses in ecosystem services that result from environmental policy, regulation, management, and economic or land-use decisions.

The Tampa Bay Ecosystem Services Project will address four specific research questions: (1) How does the level of human use (i.e., drivers of change) influence the delivery of ecosystem services in the landscape; (2) How does the spatial arrangement of landscape parcels contribute to ecosystem services provided by different land uses; (3) What data are required to generate adequate information for valuation of ecological services at the regional scale, and how transferable are the results to other systems; and (4) What decision support tools are needed to protect, enhance, and restore ecosystem services at the regional scale? Research products envisioned include: (1) Delineation and quantification of the services currently provided by Tampa Bay ecosystems; (2) assessment of the likely changes in environmental stressors and land use patterns from 2005 through 2050, (3) models that specify the relationships among stressors (anthropogenic and natural), ecosystem structure and functioning, and ecosystem services for the Tampa Bay ecosystem, (4) valuation of the ecosystem services of the Tampa Bay ecosystem in terms of human well-being, (5) examination of future options for economic development and land use changes and their projected impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being, and 6) a web-based tool to characterize the effects of economic development and land use change on the ecosystem services and human well-being of the Tampa Bay region.

SPECIFICATIONS:  
EPA is seeking partners interested in collaborative research to quantify ecosystem services in the Tampa Bay region, understand the effects of anthropogenic stresses on those services, and provide a sound scientific basis for assigning values to existing and proposed environmental policies and decisions in the context of ecosystem services. All collaborative studies must: (1) specifically address the research questions and contribute to the products described above; (2) focus on regional and national scales (it may be necessary to consider local-scale factors, but only as they contribute to the larger scales that are the focus of this project); (3) have sufficient generality to support efficient integration of the Tampa Bay research into ecological services tools applicable to every region of the United States; and d) effectively communicate with technical leads so that we are dealing efficiently with common themes and problems.

The exact form of collaborative actions may range widely: through active participation in the research by staff of collaborating organizations, by serving in an expert advisory role to the program, by funding research to fill specific technical gaps, or by supporting development of improved tools for applying the research.

PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY:  
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA).

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Seattle, WA requires the service of a contractor to develop an interim list of environmental indicators for the Puget Sound that can be used to characterize and communicate the condition of the ecosystem. This list of indicators should assess all 6 components of the Puget Sound ecosystem (water quality, water quantity, habitat and processes, species and food webs, human health, and human socio-economic and cultural well being) and reflect the goals and narrative outcomes identified by the Puget Sound Partnership.  This interim list of indicators and criteria and the process by which they were selected will be presented to the Science Panel for their review and use in developing a final set of indicators for Puget Sound, in consultation with the Leadership Council. Contractor will help with the following task:

Task 1: Identify the types of environmental data (endpoints) potentially needed to assess progress towards desired ecosystem goals and outcomes.

Ecosystem attributes associated with narrative outcomes and indicators of human well-being outlined (2006 Partnership) will be mapped to specific ecosystem elements (e.g. herring, salmon, orcas) to identify the environmental datasets (endpoints) that could be used to develop environmental indicators for each ecosystem component. If possible, conceptual models for each ecosystem component will be used to map these linkages. The availability of such environmental datasets will be determined, thereby providing a gap analysis of potential data needs. 

Task 2: Inventory, summarize and evaluate regional indicators and identify ?practical constraints? associated with indicators.

An inventory, summary and evaluation of indicators currently and formerly used or proposed for use in the Puget Sound region is needed to determine the types of environmental indicator available.  The types of indictors that will be inventoried include those developed by PSAT, the Governor?s Forum on Monitoring, Puget Sound Georgia Basin Trans-boundary Indicator Workgroup, Sustainable Seattle, TNC, Biodiversity Council, etc.  This summary would include those indicators for the whole ecosystem: terrestrial ecosystems, freshwater and marine environments, species diversity, and human well-being (i.e., health, socio-economic, cultural).  The indicators will be evaluated to determine if they are linked to the goals and outcomes identified by the Partnership and if they are ?a proximate gauge or evidence of, the state of the condition of Puget Sound?.  This process will also identify practical constraints to using particular indicators (e.g., whether there is financial support for the indicator, whether the spatial scale encompassed is appropriate, etc.).

This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

MANDATORY CLAUSE: The Western Region Acquisition Division required all contractors doing business with this acquisition to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).                                                                                               NO award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 002 TO THE	COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR AEROSPACE ACQUISITON EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS USING PARAMETRIC MODELING TECHNIQUE.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to address the following offeror's questions: 1. RFQ / RFIs - I understand that the subject effort has been an ongoing activity for the past number of years.  At one time Northrop Grumman (NG) was providing such services (through the CEPPAD sole source procurement in 9/2005) from its Huntsville, Alabama site.  Now I see that Cost, Inc. is also an incumbent.  Qa) Are both NG and Cost, Inc. staff still currently supporting the subject effort?   Ans.a) Cost Inc. is the current incumbent.  Qb) Are there any other contractors /consultants supporting this effort now?   Ans.b) No. Qc) Is this RFQ intended to augment the Cost modeling support to a desired/planned staffing level? Ans.c) No.  Q2) Is this RFQ intended to recompete the incumbent staff provided by Cost, Inc.?  Or, does it cover a wider scope? Ans.2) No.  The purpose of this RFQ is as stated in the attached SOW. Q3)  RFQ - What is the state of the current parametric cost modeling efforts at OSSMA/RAO?  Is the RAO using both a legacy system (NG?) and a new COTS based system (Cost, Inc.?) at the same time?  How long a legacy system, if any maintained, be used for this effort? Ans.3) RAO is using the current legacy system with minor modifications. Q4) What is the current cost modeling system environment?  What COTS and tools are being used to support the cost modeling effort now?  Will the Government furnished them all to the contractor, either on-site or off-site, to support the subject effort? Ans.4) Individual desk and/or laptop (PC and/or MAC).  COTS GB Stat statistical application suite or equivalent and Microsoft application software, i.e., Access, Excel, and SQL. There is no Government furnished equipment.   Q5) SOW Scope - The period of the contract notes the subject effort to last for 3 years.  The On-line RFQ notes a Delivery Date of 1/31/2010 (2 years from January 2008).  should they both match to say a 3 year contract period? Ans.5) The correct Period of Performance End date is 1/31/2011. Q6) SOW #2 - This requirement provides a summary of the NASA's total Workload environment in terms of missions, spacecrafts and instruments, etc	What percentage would reflect an average annual workload for the cost modeling requirements (collect, analyze, validate, etc.)? Ans.6) The SOW provides the necessary information of the workload required for this effort. Q7) SOW 7.3.1 - Would NDAs excited between the contractor/incumbent and the third party data suppliers disqualify the incumbent contractor from pursuing other work at other NASA GSFC Codes? at Other  NASA Centers?  If so, What would be the extent of the disqualification period?  Does OSSMA/RAO requires an Conflict of Interest Plan to help mitigate the NDA restrictions on the contractor? Ans.7) NASA has not included a Limitation of Future Contracting Clause in this Order.  Should organizational contracting issues arise during performance, they will be handled in accordance with FAR Part 9.5.   Q8) SOW 7.3 - Does the contractor need to provide a secured facility to protect third part cost data?  Or, the implementing of confidentiality procedures will be acceptable to safeguard and protect the third party cost data? Ans.8) No. NASA has no secret clearance for this Order.  Please refer to the NASA FAR 1852.237-73, RELEASE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION Clause (JUNE 2005), included in the original solicitation. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.
