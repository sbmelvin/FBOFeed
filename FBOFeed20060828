<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information.  This announcement IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR OFFER (RFO) of any kind.  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense. The purpose of this Market Survey/Request for Information is to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace, obtain information on available resources, technology and innovative approaches that may fulfill its mission need, and gain insight into industry capabilities and best practices. Attachment A describes the performance requirements that must be addressed.  Attachment B is the vendor response template.  Interested vendors are required to provide full and complete responses to the items in Attachment B.  Special emphasis is being placed on identifying innovative solutions to meet the FAA's need for a Power Per Hour (PPH) engine maintenance coverage program for their fourteen (14) Pratt & Whitney 305A engines and also for identifying performance criteria and best practices that will improve the quality of the FAA's proposed acquisition.  Excessively elaborate responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review.  Respondents to the Market Survey/Request For Information may be requested to provide additional clarification information at the option of the Government.  No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.  Information obtained from Attachment B will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for a PPH engine maintenance coverage program. At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  This market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small business concerns, or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other competitive procurement procedures.  The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 336412, with a size standard of 1000 employees.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form, and if applicable, a copy of their SBA SEDB 8(A) Certification letter. The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate small business participation in this Markey Survey MAY result in a determination to conduct this procurement under full and open competitive procedures. All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 20 pages taking into account the page count limitations specified in Attachment B.  No type font less than 12-point may be used.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  All responses, including attachments, should be submitted electronically to the following email address: richard.conyac@faa.gov.  (Reference market survey DTFAAC-06-S-000201).

<DESC>Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC), herein known as Contractor, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide the services described below to pre-qualified bidders only.  To be deemed pre-qualified to bid on the RFP, potential bidders must respond affirmatively and with sufficient detail to the "Pre-Qualification Criteria" section, Questions 1 through 9, addressing their specific areas of expertise and qualification. 

Summary Scope of Work:

Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) has a need to obtain services for drilling and monitoring well completion for the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE).  These drilling activities to geotechnically and geophysically characterize the soil and rock that underlies planned buildings and other structures being designed for a high-level nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, in Southern Nevada.  All drilling activities will occur within Area 25 of the Nevada Test Site.

BSC is planning to conduct a drilling and well completion program consisting of approximately 44 boreholes.  These 44 boreholes will consist of two basic types:

Approximately 32 of these boreholes are planned to be drilled using sonic coring and sampling methods through alluvium and the softer, unwelded to partially-welded, volcanic ash and tuff layers that underlie the alluvium in the drilling area.  The goal of these boreholes will be to tag the top of the hard Tiva Canyon tuff formation that underlies the alluvium and softer ash/tuff units.  These boreholes will vary in depth from approximately 150 feet to approximately 650 feet, with the vast majority falling in the 300 to 650 foot range.  If sonic coring methods fail to reach the desired contact depth of the Tiva Canyon formation in these boreholes, then conventional coring methods will be used below the sonic cored portion in order to complete the boreholes to the desired depth.  Upon reaching total depth, these holes will be plugged and abandoned in accordance with the requirements of Nevada state law.

The remaining approximate 12 boreholes will be drilled to greater depths and then completed as monitoring wells with grouted-in PVC casing in order to conduct downhole seismic measurements in the completed wells.  These wells will initially be sonic cored through the alluvium and into, or through, the softer ash/tuff units below, or to the maximum extent of the sonic system.  Upon reaching the harder Tiva Canyon tuff formation, or the maximum extent of the sonic system, the wells will be conventionally cored to a particular geologic horizon within the harder rock unit.  The total depth in these holes is estimated to vary between approximately 350 to 1300 feet, depending on the formations encountered.    Because these wells must be completed with 3" minimum inside diameter PVC casing that is grouted in place, the conventional coring operations can occur in either of the following two ways: 1) using a large diameter coring system, large enough to accommodate the PVC casing and necessary annular space for grouting operations in one pass, or 2) using a smaller diameter coring system (e.g., HQ) along with a reaming system to ream the holes to the final diameter necessary to grout the PVC casing in place.   In either case, 100% of the borehole must be cored (sonic and conventional).  Upon reaching total depth in each hole, geophysical and video logs will be performed in the wells by YMP personnel, prior to completion with PVC casing cement grout by the drilling subcontractor. 

A state of Nevada licensed well driller is required for this drilling program.

Location of Work:

There will be a three-year basic period of performance with options of up to five additional years, for a total potential period of performance of eight years.

<RESPDATE>091106
<ARCHDATE>10112006

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to AeroVironment, Inc., 900 Enchanted Way, Simi Valley, CA 93065 for the procurement of RQ-11B Raven Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) NATO Standards Agreement (STANAG) 4586 analysis and reporting services.  The contract will include an option for a demonstration of a RQ-11B Raven SUAS system with STANAG 4586 interface capability. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) interoperability has become of great interest to the UAS operator community and the Department of Defense.  The Marine Corps is pursuing procurement of the RQ-11B Raven through the U.S. Army’s contract W58RGZ-05-C-0338.  The RQ-11B Raven Small Unmanned Air Vehicle (SUAV) system includes a ground control station.  The NATO Standards Agreement (STANAG) 4586 is a standard that governs the interoperability of UAS ground control stations.  While STANAG 4586 has primarily been focused on interoperability of larger tactical UAS’s, the current edition of the standard has not necessarily excluded capability for SUAS interoperability and does not currently address all the capabilities necessary for handling SUAS operations.   Therefore, it is necessary to perform an analysis of the STANAG 4586 requirements as they may apply to the RQ-11B Raven as a SUAS.  AeroVironment, as the sole manufacturer of the Raven, has the explicit knowledge and understanding o!  f the system necessary to perform the analysis of STANAG 4586 and how it should apply to the SUAS.  AeroVironment also is in the unique position to identify and recommend a form of standard SUAS messaging with respect to STANAG 4586 and recommend possible changes to the STANAG and/ or changes to the existing SUAS messaging.  Finally, AeroVironment has the inherent knowledge and ability to prepare a Raven UAS system with STANAG 4586 interface capability in support of test demonstrations.  No Request for Proposal (RFP) is available for competitive bidding, however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement no later than close of business on 11 September 2006 to the contact person listed above.  Numbered Note 22 applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>The government is seeking sources for procurement and installation of simulated ship on land at Camp Lejeune NC.  The ship on land would be used for training Marines in all vessel boarding search and seizure tactics, techniques and procedures.   The assembly of the ship on land is anticipated to use a quantity of shipping containers modified to replicate a control room, berthing areas, passageways and limited engineering spaces.  It must be at least three levels high and contain ladder wells, ladders, water-tight hatches, knee-knockers, simulated overhead piping and wires as are common on commercial and military ships.  The entry point into the ship on land would be on the second level to be accessed using a removable exterior ladder or gangplank.  Exterior areas must have guard rails and line handling equipment, cargo handling equipment, all to create realistic shipboard obstacles for the training force.  The first level must have a simulated helicopter landing pad.  !  It must have a public address system to replicate sounds associated with shipboard life.  Both red and white light illumination is required in all spaces and must be capable of being powered by generator.  The upper level must have communications antennae and radar dishes as are common on ships.  The training system must be modular for possible expansion in the future.  This training system will not be used for live fire. The award will be approximately $240,000 with an anticipated delivery date of 90 days after contract award.  This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  It should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the US Government to issue a solicitation.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  Written response is requested within 15 days after publication of this notice. No phone calls will be accepted.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.

All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The sol icitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  This is SET-ASIDE 100% for SMALL BUSINESS under NAICS Code 541612 (SIC 8742) with size standard as $6.5m.  The US Army Engineer Res earch and Development Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, Mississippi, has a requirement for providing technical support for the ERDC Laboratory Personnel Demonstration Project.  1.  Scope.  The objective of the work is to provide technical support for the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Laboratory Personnel Demonstration Project. 2.  Background.  The ERDC is reengineering its civilian personnel system to improve laboratory effectiveness.  The reengineering is occurring as a personnel management demonstration project under the auspices of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  T he demonstration project, called Lab Demo, has introduced changes such as replacing General Schedule pay grades and steps with pay bands, simplified position classification, and establishment of stronger links between performance and pay. Lab Demo was authorized by Public Law 103-337 (FY95 Defense Authorization Act) and is intended to give laboratory directors more authority and flexibility in managing their civilian personnel.  The intermediate goal of Lab Demo is to have a more capable an d motivated workforce; the ultimate goal is improved scientific quality and performance and improved customer satisfaction with research and development (R&D) products. 	Under the oversight of OPM, the U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES) , Vicksburg, MS, began designing personnel system changes (referred to as interventions) in 1995.  In 1997 and 1998 the interventions were announced to the public and the workforce in Federal Register notices (published in March 1997 and March 1998).  After several changes and refinements that were based on employee feedback, Lab Demo was implemented at the WES site on September 13, 1998. 	Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, subsequently decided to consolidate its R&D Laboratories (the Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory, Geotechnical Laboratory, Structures Laboratory, Environmental Laboratory, and Information Technology Laboratory, a ll co-located at WES; the Topographic Engineering Center (TEC), Alexandria, VA; the Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL), Champaign, IL; and the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), Hanover, NH) into a single R&D Command .  The new command was named the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and is headquartered in Vicksburg, MS.  The business operations (Resource Management, Logistics, Public Works, Security, etc.) at all locations were consolidated int o the ERDC on 1 October 1998, and all technical functions (laboratories and executive elements) were consolidated into the command on 1 October 1999.  The ERDC continued R&D at all four locations (WES, CERL, TEC, and CRREL) but now functions as a single Ar my Science and Technology (S&T) Reinvention Laboratory and operates only one Personnel Demonstration Project (see Federal Register, Vol. 63, No. 200, dated October 6, 1998).  The proj ect coverage was expanded to cover participating employees at CERL, CRREL, and TEC on October 25, 1999. 	Lab Demo is being monitored by the Department of Army (DA), the Department of Defense (DoD), and OPM and is being evaluated annually.  Public Law 103-337 requires evaluation of personnel demonstration projects to support decisions about permanent changes in the personnel system and to assess the potential value of the interventions for other government agencies.  The law also requires extensive workforce training to keep employees informed of personnel system changes resulting from Lab Demo.  Evaluation be gan in 1996 in order to establish a pre-implementation baseline; training began in 1998 and will continue as long as Lab Demo is in operation. 	Lab Demo is being monitored and evaluated annually by DA, DoD, and OPM to track project impacts.  At appropriate intervals, Lab Demo will be evaluated by senior laboratory leaders to address overall impacts and by DA and DoD to determine if the project is  to be made permanent or terminated.  Evaluation results will be used by OPM to assess applicability to other government agencies. 3.  Requirements.      a.  The Contractor shall perform work under this contract in accordance with Title 5 of the U.S. Code (USC), Chapter 71, and in accordance with policies or directives established by the Project Manager for the ERDC Laboratory Personnel Demonstration P roject.      b.

Reponses to questions on this solicitation that were received prior to August 24, 2006 are as follows:

1.	Could you give us more information on what will be covered during this meeting?  Is it primarily an overview of GSA standards and requirements, or will specifics for the Nogales Border Station be presented as well?  
The pre-submittal conference is intended to clarify the requirements for AE firms interested in competing for this specific project.  Any submittals which do not meet the submittal requirements will not be considered, so it is strongly urged that interested firms attend the conference.

2.	Is the meeting mandatory?  Does not attending disqualify a firm from participating in the selection process?  If not, will information that is disseminated at the conference be electronically available to interested A/E?s?
The pre-submittal conference is not mandatory and attending will not affect the selection process.  However, if a firm neglects to adhere to the submission requirements for this project, their proposal will not be eligible for evaluation or award.  Questions, clarifications, and announcements will be made available to interested parties via the FBO website, 

3.	Will participants in the meeting be able to tour the present facilities?
Yes, please contact David Leites (david.leites@gsa.gov) no later than August 31, 2006 if you are interested in touring the existing facilities in Mariposa POE.  See the description in this Amendment 0001 of this solicitation.

This announcement does not reference any purchasing opportunities; however the estimated cost of construction is described in this Amendment 0001 of this solicitation.

8.	Is there Any Extension to the Bidding Deadline?
At this time there is no extension to the submittal deadline.

9.	Will there be a CM solicitation issued for this project as well? Is it anticipated to be a set-aside?
There will be, but it is unknown as to when and how that solicitation will occur, however these services are not anticipated to be a set-aside.

10.	Aside from the 35% local team requirement in Stage II, is there preference at all in Stage I for a Lead Designer who is geographically located in Arizona?  What are Names of countries that will be eligible to participate in this tender?
The evaluation criteria for selection of Stage I have not changed from the FBO announcement.  The 35% requirement refers to the amount of contract effort which must be performed in the State of Arizona.  This does not preclude firms based outside of Arizona from being selected for this contract, nor is there any preference for local design firms.  However, this is only a nationwide Request for Qualifications.

11.	Who is on the ?Board? for the Stage I selection of Lead Designer?
The members of the selection board have been described in the FBO announcement; however no names will be released in this solicitation.

We are soliciting sources that are able to conduct simultaneously multiple and complex preclinical toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies in a timely and efficient manner.  The studies must be conducted in compliance with 21 CFR 58, Good Laboratory Practices regulations and will be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a component of an Investigational New Drug Application.  Products for study will be either small organic new chemical entities, or complex biologics for the treatment of or prophylaxis against infectious diseases.  It is expected that the Contractor shall have experience and 	expertise conducting preclinical safety and pharmacokinetic studies using biologics (e.g. DNA plasmids, therapeutic vaccines, antibodies, and/or proteins) in addition to organic chemical molecules.  There also will be the need to develop and validate bioanalytical methods, and develop experimental formulations, as needed for GLPcompliant IND enabling studies.  The work will require the development of protocols and conduct and evaluation of studies for the evaluation of: (1) acute and subchronic systemic toxicities, and pharmacokinetics, in multiple and diverse experimental animal species, including dogs and non-human primates; (2) target organ toxicities, such as central nervous system, immune system, cardiovascular system, etc; (3) in vitro genetic toxicity and in vitro metabolic potential.  In addition it will be expected that the contractor will develop test systems and models in cutting-edge scientific subdisciplines such as toxicogenomics.  Potential sources must demonstrate and document the ability to perform multiple required studies simultaneously in a timely manner in relevant animal and in vitro models, and to promptly and efficiently evaluate the data and promptly prepare reports suitable for submission to FDA. 
 
All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about July 24, 2006, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps.

Request for Information (RFI)

***POC Phone # and FAX # correction***

Description
The Warner Robins Air Logistics Center Support Equipment Commodity Council (SECC) is conducting market research into potential cost savings associated with the purchase of remanufactured equipment items versus the procurement of new equipment items.  This acquisition strategy concept is for those items being maintained solely at the field level (ERRC=U) without the benefit of depot level repair.  The service life cycle of this equipment ranges from 5 to 20 years.  Many of these items are sent to DRMO even though they still have value and can be refurbished to ?like new? condition.  Considerations to be looked at are carcass transportation cost & turn in value at time of procurement of remanufactured item, field level ordering and service life of the remanufactured item.   Initial research indicates that this approach may be an attractive alternative to buying new equipment & cost 40-70% of what a new item would cost.     
Some examples are as follows:  Powered Construction Equipment, Tow Tractors, Trailers, Dollies, Maintenance Stands & Platforms, Test Stands, Maintenance Fixtures, Hoists, Slings, Cradles, Maintenance Stands, Hydraulic Jacks, Forklifts and Towbars. 
The SECC is interested in obtaining information from industry and academia relevant to the costs, schedule, benefits, trade-offs, in addition to the positive & negative aspects of 1) acquiring these types of items as remanufactured, or 2) initiating a depot level maintenance strategy in which the items are inducted for overhaul and returned in a like new condition.  Emphasis is placed on existing commercial capability.
The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to promote DoD Sustainment Transformation Initiatives.  SECC goals are to reduce material costs by 20%, reduce acquisition cycle times by 50% and increase material availability by 20%.  The SECC takes a strategic approach to acquisition by leveraging spend through an Enterprise-wide Acquisition Strategy to and apply and incorporate Commercial Best Practices to the AF business process. 
Please submit responses to the 542d Combat Sustainment Wing, 583 CBSS/GBMRC (Ralston), 380 Richard Ray Blvd, STE 104, Robins AFB, GA 31098-1638, NLT COB 20 September 2006. Data submissions may be via: Email attachment for unclassified data using MS Word or PDF Formats. 
Mark all proprietary information ?For Government Use Only?. 
This solicitation is for information and planning purposes only. This announcement must not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract based upon this Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<DESC>The scope of work outlined in the original announcement issued on 24 AUG 2006 shall be changed to the following:  Offerors shall provide 25 reusable or 75 disposable sensors and at least two sets of sampling system data collection hardware and softwa re, if the proposed system includes the data transmission and collection as part of the overall system.  Sensors provided shall be specific for MeS and meet the following technical specifications: Real-time sensor performance requirements include threshold  and objective requirements.  Threshold and objective requirements are identified by (T) and (O), respectively. A threshold requirement denotes a minimum acceptable performance requirement while an objective requirement denotes the desired operational capa bility to meet system performance goals.  If a requirement is not identified by (T) or (O), then the requirement is to be considered a threshold requirement.  (a)  Sensors shall respond to exposure to the simulant Methyl Salicylate (MeS) in challenge conce ntrations of 100 plus/minus 15  ng/ m³ (T) and 25 plus/minus 2.5 ng/m(3) (O).  (b)  Sensors shall respond and clear down in less than 30 seconds (T) and  0.5 seconds (O) to an exposure. (c)  Sensors shall demonstrate capability to measure concentration of MeS present to within 10 percent of the actual value.  (d)  Sensors shall provide a measurement with 95 percent Reliability and 95 percent Confidence over a range of detection from 25 ng/m(3) to 1 mg/ m(3) (T) and  25 ng/m(3) to 100 mg/m(3) (O).  (e)  Sens ors shall make accurate, reliable measurements under conditions of 20  100 percent RH and 50-125 degrees F (T) and 0-125 degress F (O). (f)  Sensors shall be disposable (T) and re-usable (O).  If reusability is required to mitigate cost, sensors must demo nstrate that they can be cleaned, disinfected, calibrated, and meet the performance requirements for each successive use.  (g) Sensors shall operate continuously for four (4) hours.  The power source shall be contained within the sensor envelope.  (h)  Cos t shall not exceed current operational costs of $60 per sample (T) at an individual location.  The goal is to reduce testing costs to at least $5 per sample (O) at an individual location.  Requirement may be attained by a low-cost, single use sensor or a m ore expensive multiple use sensor.  (i)  Sensors shall present no short term or long term health effects to the test participant.  Offeror shall provide any MSDS information available. (j) Sensor dimensions shall be no larger than 1-1/2 inch x 1-1/2 inch x   1/4 inch (T) and 1 inch x 1-3/8 inch x 1/8 inch (O). (k)  Sensors shall maintain performance requirements after being subjected to a four (4) foot (T) or six (6) foot (O) in accordance with MIL-STD-810F section 516.5. (l)  Sensors  shall be capable of op eration for 4 hours (T) and 12 hours (O) after calibration.  Offeror shall provide sensor calibration procedures. (m) Sensors shall be capable of operation for 4 hours (T) and 12 hours (O) after operational maintenance.  Operational maintenance is defined as the required maintenance procedures to prepare the sensors for each successive test trial, for example, cleaning the sensor, disinfecting the sensor, battery replacement, etc.  Offeror shall provide sensor maintenance procedures.  (n)  Sensor data outpu t shall be in analog (T) or digital (O) format for compatibility with current data collection system.  Offeror shall provide sensor data output format. (o)  Offeror shall identify any current wireless data telemetry capability, along with specifications of  the system used for data transmission and collection.  If not data telemetry enabled, offeror shall specify the signal and data output format.  (p)  Sensors shall be designed to be worn on the test participants skin in the locations as shown in figure 1, at a minimum. (q) Sensors shall operate in accordance with performance requirements without interference from water or other common gas-phase compounds emitted from a body during exercise.  (r) Offeror shall provide a plan for the production of the sensors if selected.  Offorer shall describe process used for production of current sensors and changes from this process required to meet production requirements of t hese specific sensors.  If the sensors are disposable, sensor production will be based on 10,000 sensor per year consumption rate.  If the sensors are not currently produced in any form, a plan must be developed for ultimate production of sensors in larger  quantities or as multiple systems.  The plan shall include subcontractor tasks that are or will be used to support the effort and a description of their capabilities.

The Department of the U.S. Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund is assessing the market to gain information to support research on the community development finance industry. The CDFI Fund is seeking information on how to design and implement such research. 

ABOUT THE CDFI FUND
The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund was created in 1994 for the purpose of promoting economic revitalization and community development through investment in and assistance to CDFIs. CDFIs include community development banks; credit unions; housing, business, microenterprise, and community facilities loan funds; and community development venture capital funds. The CDFI Fund also manages the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program which was authorized under the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000. 

The CDFI Fund achieves its purpose by promoting access to capital and local economic growth in the following ways: 1) through its CDFI Program by directly investing in, supporting and training CDFIs that provide loans, investments, financial services and technical assistance to underserved populations and communities; 2) through its New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program by providing an allocation of tax credits to community development entities (CDEs) which enable them to attract investment from the private-sector and reinvest these amounts in Low Income Communities; 3) through its Bank Enterprise Award (BEA) Program by providing an incentive to banks to invest in their communities and in CDFIs; and 4) through its Native Initiatives, by taking action to provide financial assistance, technical assistance, and training to Native CDFIs and other Native entities proposing to become or create Native CDFIs. To date, the Fund has made more than 1,800 awards totaling over $729 million, and tax credit allocations totaling $8 billion.  For more information on the CDFI Fund, go to www.cdfifund.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)----The Program Executive Office, Missiles and Space on behalf of the United States Army is conducting a market survey to identify available technological solutions and approaches in support of the Integrated Air and Miss ile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) and to obtain information on risk, capability and price. The IBCS Component concept provides for an IAMD Common Battle Management, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) with Int egrated Fire Control (IFC) hardware/software product design, integration, and development that supports fielding of an IAMD Increment 2 Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY11.   	This notice is published in accordance with FAR Parts 10.002 and 15.201 and is a Request for Information (RFI) only in support of a market survey. All information received will be used for planning purposes only. This notice does not constitute an Invitat ion for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotes. The Government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it. I.  IAMD PROGRAM OVERVIEW: 	The U.S. Army transformation calls for a network-centric system-of-systems capability (also referred to as Plug and Fight) that integrates all Air and Missile Defense (AMD) sensors, weapons (including launchers) and BMC4I.  This future IAMD System of Sy stems (SoS) architecture will enable the distributed support of engagements with available sensor assets not limited to system-centric organic sensors.  AMD materiel transformation, along with  other Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership a nd Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) changes, will be conducted in increments of improved capability  through FY17.    	The IAMD Program represents a shift from a traditional system-centric weapon systems acquisition to a component-based acquisition approach.  This component-based acquisition approach will provide the most efficient way to acquire and integrate the compone nts of the incremental IAMD architectures.  Unlike traditional acquisition programs that focus primarily on the development of a single system or platform, the IAMD Program is structured to enable the development of an overarching net-centric capability wi th all participating AMD components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems.  The IAMD Program achieves this objective by establishing the incremental IAMD architecture and dev eloping the following:  the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) that provides the common IAMD BMC4I capability, IFC Network capability to provide fire control connectivity and enabling distributed operations, and the Common Plug & Fight (P&F) Interface modif ication kits that will enable weapon and sensors connectivity to the IFC network. Development of the component-unique part of the P&F Interfaces remains within the purview of the affected components project/product office. 	The IAMD Program will employ an evolutionary acquisition strategy consisting of multiple capability increments leading to an objective capability in FY17. This approach provides the opportunity for technology insertions into the program throughout each in crement as high-payoff technologies mature and are ready for integration.  This enables an orderly and cost-effective migration from the current system-centric architecture to the IAMD net-centric architecture. The first increment, Increment 1, is being im plemented by the User Community, primarily involving non-materiel changes as the basis for follow-on incremental capabilities.  Increment 2 is the focus of the IAMD Project Office.  	Increment 2 is structured to meet the emerging requirements for an integrated net-centric AMD capability by FY11.  This capability is supported by an early Risk Mitigation phase for advancing key enabling initiative s while concurrently developing the Increment 2 architecture. The desired end-state of the IAMD Increment 2 physical architecture, consisting of PATRIOT, Surface Launched Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (SLAMRAAM) Fire Unit, Advanced Sentinel, Ter minal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated and Netted Sensor System (JLENS), and Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) components working in an integrated manner via an IFC network to support the engage ment of targets. The IFC Network will include high bandwidth communications and integrated network management.  The IFC Network will be Joint Net Ready Key Performance Parameters (KPP) compliant and will support AMD Composite Battalion Task Force (TF) oper ations.  The IAMD Increment 2 will maintain current force interfaces into Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAADC2) and will include new interfaces into Future Combat System (FCS), while maintaining connectivity to the Army Battle Command Syste m (ABCS).   	Other Increment 2 significant capabilities consist of the following: 1) Common battle command and control using common open services and software, and common hardware; 2) Elevated (JLENS Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD)), and ground-based 360° radars; 3) Integrated combat identification (CID) across the IFC Network and with Joint networks; 4) Networked AMD sensors with common track management enabling both situational awareness and fire control for Air Breathing Targets (ABTs), Unmanned Aerial V ehicles (UAV), Cruise Missile (CM), and Ballistic Missiles (BM) threats; 5) Integrated fire control across IFC Network that allows for engage on network data using PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC) 3, PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE), and/or SLAMRAA M weapons; 6) Integrated engagement operations across an IFC Network that provides for  composite battalion TF battle management and engage on network data battle management: and 7) Integrated Force Operations / Engagement Operations (FO/EO) with collabora tive planning and embedded training. 	The IAMD Program includes Increment 2 Systems Engineering, Integration and Test (SEI&T) activities and the development of enabling End Items (EIs) consisting of an IBCS Command Post (CP) and P&F Interface Modification Kits for applicable IAMD weapons and sensor components. These EI products are built from modular hardware and software configuration items:  open architecture computing environment, IAMD common software, communications, common platforms, common shelters, and Command Center System (CCS).  Comm on configuration items will be evaluated and selected from Joint, other Services, and Army programs as applicable and feasible. 	The IAMD strategy is based on incremental consolidation and migration of BMC4I, weapons and sensor efforts using the international MEADS program and related PATRIOT-MEADS Combined Aggregate Program (CAP) extensions where appropriate.  The IAMD architectur e provides the underlying standards and protocols for the net-centric, P&F capability.  The IBCS CPs and P&F Interface Modification Kits will include Joint solutions (as made available) such as a Joint Track Manager (JTM) and a Common Data Link Interface ( CDLI) manager.  Additionally, the IFC Network provides the framework to transfer fire control quality data over a high bandwidth communications channel between the IBCS and various weapons and sensors to prosecute engagements.  The Joint Tactical Radio Sys tem (JTRS) is identified to fill the IFC Network communications capabilities.  Use of interim solutions in lieu of the Joint solution will be considered if the Joint solution does not meet near term milestones for development or production. II.  IBCS STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES 	A.  OVERALL PROGRAM OBJECTIVES  The overall objective of the Increment 2 IBCS System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase is to design, develop, integrate and test the IBCS CP and P&F Mod Kit comp onents necessary to enable the IAMD Network-centric Increment 2 architecture.  1.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Trial Sight Training
<DESC>The statutory authorities for this acquisition as a sole source are 41 USC 253(c)(1) - Only one responsible source and 41 USC 253(c)(2) - Unusual and compelling urgency.  The Office of Trademark Quality Review and Training has utilized the e-learning system in this acquisition request for over four years to great success.  The e-learning modules supported by this system have been authored on proprietary software owned by the requested source and are not transferable to another source.  As the need for continuing access and use of these modules is essential to the mission of training trademark examining attorneys and others within the Trademark Office, loss of this source would require re-authoring the modules and would be burdensome and inefficient at best and otherwise damaging to the agency.  Use of the current source is further warranted as the current contract with the source has lapsed and therefore must be renewed or face immediate loss of the ability to utilize the e-learning modules already authored.  These modules are essential to the training of new trademark examining attorneys as well as others within the Trademark Office.  This is an unusual and compelling urgency, as 60 or more new trademark examining attorneys in Fiscal Year 2007 will require the training provided through the current source, as will other current employees.  The use of the e-modules in part fulfills the Trademark Office?s responsibilities under the current Strategic Plan.

<SUBJECT>36 -- Notice of Intent to award to a Sole Source Procurement.
<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source firm-fix-price purchase order for these Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Power Filter Cabinet Systems to Tyco Electronics Corp, PO Box 3608, Harrisburg  PA 17105.  The EMP Power Filter Cabinet Systems need to be purchased in order to enable operations to continue 24x7 in DSCS Support Building.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because Tyco/CORCOM is currently the only manufacturer that produces EMP Power Filter Cabinet Systems that consistently meets the technical electrical and mechanical specifications required.  Additionally, CORCOM Filter Cabinets have a long history of use in DoD facilities that are protected against EMP.  There is extensive experience with maintaining and testing the operation of CORCOM filter Systems.  CORCOM Filter Cabinets are currently installed in three other Offutt EMP protected facilities. All filter cabinets have identical filter elements, and there are spare filter elements available for immediate replacement if one fails. This interoperability is a critically important justification for sole-source, because these facilities are required by JCS to be continually EMP protected and available for supporting the National Command Authority. Lead time for procuring these filter cabinets or filter elements can be upwards of 12 Weeks. The last time a filter system failed, we were able to install the on-hand spare filter elements and quickly restore full operational capability. We were then operating under increased risk (i.e., if another filter system failed we didn't have adequate on-hand spares) for the 12 weeks it took to replace the spare elements. In addition, life-cycle maintenance costs (inspection, periodic testing) are reduced by employing identical Power Filter Cabinet systems (joint usage and identical systems minimizes maintenance process development and training, spare parts, specialized tools, and unique electronic testing apparatus).  The customer conducted a web search that did not provide information on any additional acceptable EMP filter manufacturers.   Mechanical/Electrical Compatibility, form-fit-function. Physical and electrical design of the CORCOM filter cabinet system will minimize installation costs: simply remove old system and replace with new.   The mechanical/electrical configuration afforded by proposed filter are key to a successful installation because changing the HEMP shield penetration points will substantially increase the expense, installation time (including additional testing) and the chance of acceptance test failure when compared to exploiting the existing penetrations and provisions for mechanical attachment of the existing filter filter/cabinet. The procurement of these EMP filters for the DSCS Support building must be completed in a timely manner in order to meet mission requirements.  Questions should be directed to SSgt Joseph J. Luetke in writing via email to: joseph.luetke@offutt.af.mil or via facsimile at (402) 294-7280.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Trimble R7 Base and Rover GPS Kits - ISP
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole-source award with Marinel Inc for Trimble R7 Base and Rover GPS Kits- ISP.  MacDill AFB Contracting intends to issue a purchase order to Marinel Inc under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(i) unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.

This is a Brand Name and Sole Source justification based on the requirement to purchase identical previously purchased equipment.  This equipment is on the Program?s approved Basis of Issue (BOI).  The current Mission Familiarization Virtual Reality (MFVR) software used by this program for Survey missions requires special software code written to allow the GPS and its components  to properly function and communicate with the MFVR software.  The communication and diagnostic test code software took six (6) months to develop at a cost of over 150K.  Based on this investment in time, effort, and funds, the Trimble R7 Base and Rover GPS Kit is required.  

The request to use the same Vendor is due to the time, effort, and funds required by this program to teach the Vendors local based technicians how to test the equipment when it is utilized with the MFVR software.  Cost to the program to teach and maintain technical requirements with this local Vendor over the past Eight months is in excess of 50K to date.  

Once this equipment is setup with the MFVR software, it can not be sent directly back to the manufacturer due to the manipulation and integration of the equipment, software, and software code.  On all but one occasion, the faults within the equipment were associated with the interface between the equipment and the software.  If a different vendor is required, there will be an additional requirement and cost to train their technicians at their facility on how to use our system in relation to the equipment.  The current vendor is only 15 minutes from this installation, and provides assistance 24/7 within a 6 hour notification.   The amount of time, effort, and funds to change brand names and companies will exceed 200K. CLINs:

CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Gateway All-in-One workstations.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST has identified the Gateway Profile 6.0 workstation as a key component for overseas Consular interviewing booths and staff offices.  The Profile 6.0 was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The Gateway Profile 6 is only low form factor PC that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1)	It is the only low form factor PC now manufactured that combines the screen display, processor, and all other components in one compact unit.  It occupies less than 1/3 of the space used by conventional mini-tower PCs deployed by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and eliminates overcrowding common to interviewing booths and visa issuance desks. 2)	The Profile 6 is Gateway’s 6th generation low form factor PC.  It is a tried and known device. Several thousand Profiles have been purchased and installed in Consular settings since 2000 and have experienced extremely low meantime between failure (MBF) rates.  3)	The Profile 6 complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. 4)	Unlike low form factor PCs assembled by some other manufacturers, Gateway guarantees that all parts specified in the Profile configuration (other than processors, which are replaced by new versions every 3 months on average) will be obtainable throughout the period in which the model is manufactured (usually 12 months). 5)	The Profile 6 is the only low form factor PC outfitted with a powered Firewire port. The presence of this port enables Consular staff to connect fingerprint scanners directly to the PC, thereby obviating the need to rely upon jury-rigged power supply and adapter arrangements that have caused a number of visa applicants to receive electric shocks when their fingerprints were captured.   In summation, CA/EX/CSD believes that the Department’s best interests will be served if the Gateway Profile 6 is procured at this time.  No other BAA/TAA compliant all-in-one workstation fully meets the Department’s requirements. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Gateway Profile 6.0 workstation has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board

BIDS MUST BE VALID FOR 30 DAYS AFTER COMPETITION CLOSE. FOB DESTINATION CONUS GFMS will work in concert with the recently implemented Regional Financial Management System (RFMS) that uses the same COTS software and technical architecture. The same technical architecture is also used for the Joint Financial Management System (JFMS) project with USAID. GFMS requires an expansion to the existing Storage Area Network (SAN) development environment in BIMC and Charleston, SC to accommodate the increased volume of domestic financial data. The CFMS development environment is estimated to be 12 terabytes. This estimate includes the space required for primary storage for several development and test environments (e.g. development, integration, production simulation, etc.) as well as sufficient mirror backup copies.   Data must be fully mirrored to an existing Network Appliance secondary SAN to replicate the current 23x6 ½ worldwide operation. Charleston currently supports 178 posts and Washington at the consolidated facility. Data must be continuously "mirrored" to secondary databases to support the high availability required by 23 hour per day operations, as well as reporting, backup and recovery without affecting online production. Likewise, the SAN must support high volumes of data updates from both batch and online sources and be able to "simulate" all key production storage operations. In order to debug performance issues, test new releases of operating system software, and ensure consistent operations support to production, the development SAN environment must be the same as the production SAN.  In addition, GFMS requires a second SAN for its corresponding COOP installation at the Beltsville, MD (BIMC) COOP site. BIMC already uses Network Appliance technology to support the COOP operations of a number of Bureaus including RM, AF, DS and WHA. This COOP SAN will be used to support the implementation of GFMS. Industry Data Both State and USAID have an extensive investment in Network Appliance SAN hardware and software technology. Network Appliance SAN hardware is used by State and USAID for the current production operations of the RFMS and Phoenix financial systems as well as the RFMS COOP site. The State Department has taken extensive advantage of the Network Appliance SAN software technology in the bureaus to support Network Appliance mirroring of bureau data to consolidated databases. Network Appliance SAN hardware/software technology is currently installed in IRM, DS, EUR, WHA, AF and RM and has been approved by the ITCCB (Ref # H-AS-NA-AS-0024). Network Appliance technology has also been adopted by the State Department's preferred database vendor (Oracle) as its own internal corporate SAN in one of the largest (several hundred terabytes) corporate SAN installations supporting Oracle's worldwide operations. The Impact of Not Requiring Brand Name The Department's financial system must be available worldwide on a 23 x 6 ½ basis at the consolidated facility in Charleston, SC. (CONTINUED)  The Department has already deployed Network Appliance hardware for the production versions of RFMS that supports all overseas financial activity. GFMS will use the same technical architecture as RFMS and ultimately will be combined into a single database. The development environment that GFMS is built and tested in must be 100% compatible with production RFMS. This means the same release of software, the same ability to "mirror" databases, and the ability to test new releases of the Network Appliance operating system software before they are moved onto the production Network Appliance SAN.The Department is also in the midst of an important effort with USAID in the implementation of a Joint Financial Management System (JFMS) that consolidates both State and USAID on a common technical platform to be hosted by the State Department in the Financial Services Center in Charleston, SC. Again OMB is closely monitoring the progress of this initiative. USAID has already installed Network Appliance SAN hardware/software for their Phoenix financial system. The selection of different SAN by State would mean that State and USAID could not share common components within the JFMS Charleston technical environment, thus eliminating planned savings on software and hardware.   Recommendation Based on the current production installed base of Network Appliance SAN hardware/software and the critical need for the GFMS and JFMS projects to stay consistent with their production storage operations, RM recommends this one time acquisition (Brand Name Justification) of Network Appliance SAN hardware and software for the GFMS development environment and the GFMS COOP site.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

FAR 52.212-2   Evaluation  Commercial Items (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

M.1. PREPARING THE PROPOSAL
Offerors shall submit a copy of their technical and cost proposal.  Proposals shall, at a minimum, contain the items described in this section.  Each proposal shall contain sufficient information to enable a thorough evaluation.  Proposals must specifically address the goals and requirements of the specifications.  The offerors capabilities to accomplish the requirements of this solicitation must be clearly demonstrated.  All proposals which merely offer to conduct a program in accordance with the requirements of the Governments statement of work will be considered non-responsive and will not be considered further.  

M. 2.   EVALUATION CRITERIA
Technical Proposal  The following is listed in descending order of importance:
1.  Experience.  Describe experience performing requirements similar during the past 3 years.  Include accurate information that will allow the evaluators to contact contract administrators involved with the referenced work.  Names, phone numbers, dates, locations, type of work, etc. are critical.  Specifically identify a foreman that you will provide for the performance of this contract as a Key Personnel.  Provide information about his/her experience. Provide sufficient information so that the evaluators may make contact with anyone who can verify these experiences.
2.  Past Performance.  Provide details on quality of work performed on all similar contracts within the past 3 years.  List and discuss any work not paid at full bid price.  Address specific performance failures and how you mitigated the cause of those failures.  Provide details regarding timeliness of performance or lack thereof.  Discuss business performance statement that describes relationships and cooperation with customers.  Include any investigation of alleged or actual violations of labor or immigration laws committed by your firm within the past three years and the disposition of those cases. 
 3.  Technical Approach. 

Understanding of the Governments Requirements.  The Government will evaluate each offerors relative understanding of the Governments requirements on the basis of its written submittals addressing the following sub factors:
a.)	Any information that indicates the extent to which the site for this project was visited.
b.)	The results concluded from the site visit.
c.)	The resources (personnel and equipment) which are planned for use on the project, and how realistic that plan is given concurrent obligations.
d.)	Site-specific safety plan.
e.)	Plan of work.
f.)	Where applicable, estimated production rates.
	4.  Price Proposal. The price proposal should consist of itemized pricing as listed in the Schedule of Items.  Award may not necessarily be made to the offeror submitting the lowest offer.  Also, the award may not be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for successful performance of the work.  The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest of the Government.  It is anticipated that the award will be made to the firm with the best value, considering price, technical proposal, and technical capabilities. 

M. 3.    BASIS FOR AWARD
The Government will award the contract to the offeror(s) who (a) asserts to the terms of the solicitation, and (b) has the best combination of experience, past performance technical proposal, and price.  Experience is a matter of the number of opportunities an offeror has had to do similar work and to encounter the kinds of problems that the Contractor is likely to encounter in the performance of this contract.  Past performance is a matter of an offerors reputation for integrity and customer satisfaction.  Quality control and the understanding of the work is a matter of the offerors familiarity with the nature of the work and with the kinds of problems the Contractor is likely to encounter during performance. 

Award(s) may be made without further discussions.  Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a technical and cost standpoint, which the offeror can submit to the Government.  However, the Government may, after evaluation of the proposals, conduct further oral or written discussions as appropriate with offerors whose proposals are within the competitive range. 

Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to provide histologic services for the NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) Office of Habitat Conservation requires the services to be acquired using simplified acquisition procedures, FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Background: Over 35 coral diseases have now been reported from around the world. Limited information is currently available on many of these diseases, including few available data on their abundance, distribution and impact. Furthermore, published reports and grey literature refers to a recent emergence of new conditions, but there are concerns that a number of these diseases are being incorrectly identified.   Services are needed to obtain accurate information on the prevalence and impact of diseases and to develop and train teams that are able to respond to unusual disease outbreaks as a part of the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program coral disease efforts and the Coral Disease and Health Consortium=s National Research Plan, to which NOAA has committed its support.  This represents three separate tasks, one involves field monitoring and mapping and the other two tasks involve training in coral disease rapid response. Specifically, the contractors will contribute to NOAAs duties under these projects: 1) Conduct surveys off the west and south coast of Puerto Rico four times over one year to assess the population dynamics, condition and prevalence of coral diseases, 2) Map the spatial distribution of Acropora palmata colonies off La Parguera, Guanica, Ponce, Guayanilla, Boquer?n, Mayaguez and Rincon, and assess the condition of these corals, 3) Train a team of researchers to identify diseases in the western Atlantic, and respond to unusual disease outbreaks, including approaches to collect ecological data and to sample affected corals for histology, TEM/SEM, microbiology and molecular biology. The classroom and field activities must be conducted in Puerto Rico and/or the USVI and must involve researchers and/or graduate students based in the U.S. Caribbean, 4) Train a team of researchers to identify diseases in the Pacific, and respond to unusual disease outbreaks, including approaches to collect ecological data and to sample affected corals for histology, TEM/SEM, microbiology and molecular biology. 

Scope of Work  

Task 1 - NOAA Coral Disease and Health Consortium -The contractor will establish a program in Puerto Rico to evaluate the abundance and distribution of coral diseases and the condition of Acropora palmata colonies on nearshore and offshore reefs around the west and south coast of the island and the offshore U.S. affiliated islands of Mona and Desecheo.   The number of diseases present, the prevalence of these diseases and the species they are affecting shall be identified. The spatial extent, distribution and condition of A. palmata on nearshore reefs shall be characterized by the contractor.  
1) Through the use of belt transects and reexamination of tagged corals within permanent sites in different reef environments (e.g., back and fore reef habitats) and different distances from land (nearshore, mid shelf and shelf edge reefs), the prevalence, incidence and impact of coral diseases will be examined. Specific objectives include: i)Characterization of the prevalence of diseases (type of disease, species affected and proportion of the population with active disease signs) on reefs off the south and west coast. Data will be collected on species diversity and size frequency of corals; percent live tissue and extent of recent mortality; and cause of mortality, ii)Characterization of changes in live tissue (planar surface area) and spreading rates of diseases under different environmental conditions (e.g., relationship with depth, temperature, visibility/turbidity and distance from population centers) on tagged corals, iii)Extent of regrowth of coral tissue on colonies affected by disease, which have gone into remission and patterns of recruitment on exposed coral skeletal surfaces, iv)In addition to field surveys, additional corals will be tagged if a disease outbreak is documented, and samples of diseased tissue will be collected for histological examinations.

2) To aid in the management and regulatory activities related to ESA listing of two ESA corals (Acropora palmata and A. cervicornis), the extant spatial distribution in south and west Puerto Rico will be mapped and compiled in a GIS database.  Specific objectives include: i) Mapping the perimeter of extant stands of A. palmata and specific points of living colonies in areas where they occur as isolated corals or in small aggregates, ii) Assess the condition of corals within each area, characterizing size, percent live tissue and presence of disease or other causes of mortality, iii) Tag representative colonies for long term monitoring, iv) Identify and characterize patterns of recruitment

Task 2  - Disease Outbreak Investigative Procedures Training for Pacific Corals:

The shell shall be watertight and rigid.  The front of the shell shall be removable to permit replacement of the cylinder and the shell seams shall not pass through the drain valve opening.  The shell shall consist of the following: openings for a door; cylinder shaft; four-compartment automatic and manual supply dispensers; water piping and steam heat exchanger; drain outlet; overflow and vent outlet; and water level and temperature indicator.  
The cylinder construction shall be rigid.  Perforations in the cylinder shall be sized and spaced for efficient washing, rinsing, and extraction.  It shall be provided with a hinged door as part of the front head and a means to prevent laundry from 
falling between the cylinder and shell during loading and unloading.  The door shall not be less than 150 square inches for each 50 pounds of rated capacity.
The washer-extractor shall be provided with an electric and pneumatic power-operated brake for rapid deceleration and stopping of the cylinder.  The brake shall stop rotation of a loaded cylinder within 60 seconds during any part of the extraction cycle.
The contour and configuration of the shell plating and the location and configuration of the booster heater shall be such that the water consumption will be kept to a minimum.  Water levels shall be readily adjustable in the field.
Piping valves and fittings shall have a working pressure of 100 pounds per square inch.
The drain valve, hot and cold freshwater inlet valves, and steam inlet valve shall be electric and automatically controlled by the automatic formula control unit.

Means shall be provided for adjusting tension of the V-belts.
Gears shall be in accordance with AGMA 2000-A88 and AGMA 2001-B88.  The gears shall transmit full rated horsepower throughout the speed ranges without failure for the expected serviced life of the washer-extractor.
Safety and interlocking devices shall function for both clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the cylinder and when the ship is rolling or listing at not less than 12 degrees from its normal position.  
The driving arrangement shall permit changing from the wash to the extract cycle and vice versa with interlocking feature to ensure smooth transfer.
The main brake shall be normally closed and prevent cylinder rotation while the machine is off.  Also, in the event of power loss and/or loss of low pressure air, the brake shall close automatically.
The shell door shall be fitted with an electric interlock that prevents the door from being opened when the machine is in the extract mode, and prevents rotation of the cylinder when the shell door is open except in the JOG mode.

Wherever the words offer, proposal, offerors, or similar terms are used in this solicitation or any provision, they shall be read to mean quote, quotation, quoter, vendor or similar corresponding term to refle ct that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids.

Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current acces s information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), co mmercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  The se gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days o n which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate dela ys in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt con crete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicle s (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as app ropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, cont ractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the  Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for a ny reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be iss ued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Pro gram shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification b adge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program  contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for con ducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast a ccess identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet  the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g. , quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar da ys of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An emp loyees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may ch ange the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identific ation badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both t he FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduct ion is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s ).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all ident ification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation. Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are  being requested and a more detailed solicitation is available on the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FEDTEDS) Web Page at http://www.fedteds.gov/  or at https://www.fedteds.gov/fedteds/start.nsf/frm.VendorLogin?OpenForm&SolicitationNumber=W912HZ-06-T-00 42 , which includes exhibits that could not be posted as this site. Offerors should check the FEDTEDS Web Page often for new solicitations and/or changes (AMENDMENTS) to existing ones. Solicitation Number W912HZ-06-T-0042 is being issued as a request for q uotation (RFQ) with the intent to award as a simplified acquisition. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  This procurement is SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE under NAI CS Code 561990 (SIC 7389) with a size standard of $6.5 M. The USACE, Vicksburg District, Consolidated Contracting Office, proposes to award a simplified acquisition to furnish all the necessary labor and materials to dewater a section of the upstream area of the American Dam, El Paso, Texas, and to remove the ground water in the inspection area along the upstream edge of the concrete apron and sheet pile cutoff, (USIBWC will excavate the inspection pit) to permit inspection of the sheet pile by Government E ngineers.  Dewatering of the inspection area will be to approximately 3 ft below the base of the excavated pit.  The base of the excavated pit will be approximately to a depth of 9 ft below the upstream concrete apron, corresponding to approximately elevation 3,667 f t MSL (see profile in Figure 2).  The dewatered ground water level will be maintained 3 ft below this elevation for a period of approximately 5 days.  The excavated work pit will consist of:  a)  approximately a 15 ft long x 15 ft wide x 9 ft deep excavated area against the upstream edge of the sheet pile cutoff wall, and  b) an excavated approach area with approximately a 1V:5H slope to permit working in the excavated area without the requirement for shoring.  The total excavated area may be modified slightly because of the site conditions or excavation requirements for the  equipment.  However, it is expected that the total excavated area will measure approximately 60 ft x 60 ft and will be dewatered to provide access for equipment and inspection of the upstream sheet pile cutoff. The inspection can only be done during the non-irrigation season which extends from approximately September 1, 2006 through March 10, 2007.  The dates for inspection of the sheet pile will be coordinated with ERDC, the Contractor, and the IBWC.  The dewate ring and inspection shall be performed during the non-irrigation season.  The dewatering and inspection will be completed no later than the March 1, 2007.  There is always some degree of flow in the river and the chance of precipitation is likely. The USIBWC will provide an excavator and an operator to open the pit.  The USIBWC will provide the necessary State or Federal permits for surface water discharge and/or other required permits to support environmental compliance. The contractor shall furnish all necessary labor and materials to dewater the excavation to permit inspection and sampling of the sheet pile by ERDC engineers.  The contractor shall provide all pumps, installation of wells, drains, etc., to perform the nec essary dewatering.  The contractor shall be responsible for the security of their equipment and its service (fuel and maintenance).  The contractor shall dewater the area such that the ground water is at least 3 ft below the base of the pit and the extende d excavation area and will maintain this level of dewatering for approximately 5 days to permit the inspection and sampling of the sheet pile .  At the end of the project, the contractor shall remove the dewatering system and/or grout the wells in accordance with the State of Texas rules and regulations.  The Contractor shall submit a dewatering plan for approval by ERDC and USIBWC before work c an commence.  The plan shall contain a schedule for mobilization, execution, and demobilization, including removal and/or grouting of the well system. Quality Control and Quality Assurance The contractor shall establish a quality control program to assure the requirements of the contract are provided as specified. Quality Assurance:  The Contracting Officer Representative (COR) will troubleshoot issues and inspect/accept services provided under the contract.  The COR will help resolve problems due to unusual site conditions, answer any questions that may arise, and assist with the coordination between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission (US IBWC or IBWC) representatives for the American Dam Dewatering. Performance:  Performance will begin after award of the contract and the notice to proceed has been given.  Performance factors will include the approval of the dewatering plan by the ERDC and IBWC representatives.  This approval must be granted before any  work can proceed.  A plan of progress for the dewatering will be developed to include performance based measures.  One metric for contract performance will be to measure the water table in the dewatering area and maintain a log of water table measurements  on a fixed schedule to identify drawdown levels in the dewatered area.  A record of water table elevations in the dewatering area will provide measured performance levels of accomplishment. Deficiencies:  Deficiencies will include the failure to meet the proposed time schedules for dewatering, after an agreed upon date for the work is accepted by all three parties involvedThe Contractor, ERDC, and the IBWC.  Deficiencies will also include fa ilure to dewater to the maximum elevation specified under this contract.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Gateway All-in-One workstations.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST has identified the Gateway Profile 6.0 workstation as a key component for overseas Consular interviewing booths and staff offices.  The Profile 6.0 was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The Gateway Profile 6 is only low form factor PC that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1)	It is the only low form factor PC now manufactured that combines the screen display, processor, and all other components in one compact unit.  It occupies less than 1/3 of the space used by conventional mini-tower PCs deployed by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and eliminates overcrowding common to interviewing booths and visa issuance desks. 2)	The Profile 6 is Gateway’s 6th generation low form factor PC.  It is a tried and known device. Several thousand Profiles have been purchased and installed in Consular settings since 2000 and have experienced extremely low meantime between failure (MBF) rates.  3)	The Profile 6 complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. 4)	Unlike low form factor PCs assembled by some other manufacturers, Gateway guarantees that all parts specified in the Profile configuration (other than processors, which are replaced by new versions every 3 months on average) will be obtainable throughout the period in which the model is manufactured (usually 12 months). 5)	The Profile 6 is the only low form factor PC outfitted with a powered Firewire port. The presence of this port enables Consular staff to connect fingerprint scanners directly to the PC, thereby obviating the need to rely upon jury-rigged power supply and adapter arrangements that have caused a number of visa applicants to receive electric shocks when their fingerprints were captured.   In summation, CA/EX/CSD believes that the Department’s best interests will be served if the Gateway Profile 6 is procured at this time.  No other BAA/TAA compliant all-in-one workstation fully meets the Department’s requirements. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Gateway Profile 6.0 workstation has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board

CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation as a key component for overseas Consular interviewing booths and staff offices.  The Dell Optiplex GX520 SFF was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The Dell Optiplex GX520 is only small form factor workstation that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1)     It is a specific all-in-one configuration that includes three separate components: the Dell Optiplex GX520 small form factor workstation, a 19-inch Dell flat panel monitor, and a stand.  It occupies less than 1/3 of the space used by conventional mini-tower PCs deployed by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and eliminates overcrowding common to interviewing booths and visa issuance desks.  Moreover, the Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation provides additional space with an opening underneath the monitor that can be used for keyboard storage or to corral small office supplies. This space can be significantly useful to users with limited workspace.   2)       It is the only small form factor PC manufactured that combines the screen display, processor, and all other components in one compact unit, while still allowing the components to separate from each other.  This feature is useful when one piece of the all-in-one configuration is malfunctioning and must be replaced.      3)       The Dell Optiplex GX520 small form factor workstation complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. The following Consular Affairs overseas applications were tested for functionality: ACRS, ACS, ACS+, ST, CST_PWD, INK, IVO, and NIV. 4)       The Dell GX520 has BTX (balance technology extended) chassis, power supply, and motherboard that are designed for thermal efficiency providing improved reliability and quieter operation. Dell’s HyperCool thermal management technology uses variable speed fans that provide optimal cooling with less power and enables quieter operation. 5)       The workstation is a modular unit and uses industry standard components, which will decrease the amount of time needed service this workstation. The Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation offers a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 processor, with an Intel 945G Express chipset. The Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation comes equipped with an 80 gigabyte SATA drive, and 512 MB of RAM. In summation, CA/CST believes that the Department’s best interests will be served if the Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation is procured at this time. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.

CA/CST has identified the Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation as a key component for overseas Consular interviewing booths and staff offices.  The Dell Optiplex GX520 SFF was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The Dell Optiplex GX520 is only small form factor workstation that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1)     It is a specific all-in-one configuration that includes three separate components: the Dell Optiplex GX520 small form factor workstation, a 19-inch Dell flat panel monitor, and a stand.  It occupies less than 1/3 of the space used by conventional mini-tower PCs deployed by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and eliminates overcrowding common to interviewing booths and visa issuance desks.  Moreover, the Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation provides additional space with an opening underneath the monitor that can be used for keyboard storage or to corral small office supplies. This space can be significantly useful to users with limited workspace.   2)       It is the only small form factor PC manufactured that combines the screen display, processor, and all other components in one compact unit, while still allowing the components to separate from each other.  This feature is useful when one piece of the all-in-one configuration is malfunctioning and must be replaced.      3)       The Dell Optiplex GX520 small form factor workstation complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. The following Consular Affairs overseas applications were tested for functionality: ACRS, ACS, ACS+, ST, CST_PWD, INK, IVO, and NIV. 4)       The Dell GX520 has BTX (balance technology extended) chassis, power supply, and motherboard that are designed for thermal efficiency providing improved reliability and quieter operation. Dell’s HyperCool thermal management technology uses variable speed fans that provide optimal cooling with less power and enables quieter operation. 5)       The workstation is a modular unit and uses industry standard components, which will decrease the amount of time needed service this workstation. The Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation offers a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 processor, with an Intel 945G Express chipset. The Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation comes equipped with an 80 gigabyte SATA drive, and 512 MB of RAM. In summation, CA/CST believes that the Department’s best interests will be served if the Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation is procured at this time. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board FOB Destination CONUS

<DESC>NIGMS Science Writing, Electronic Content Development and Planning,
and Outreach Strategy

August 2006


Purpose

The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) requires an on-site contractor for science writing, electronic content development and planning, and outreach strategizing. The contractor will function as the Institute?s expert advisor on electronic opportunities and trends, and will conduct outreach activities related to the NIGMS Web site and other communication products and events.  These products include the NIGMS Feedback Loop electronic newsletter to grantees and approaches to promote two-way interaction with the scientific community.

Background

NIGMS is one of the 27 institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the principal biomedical research agency of the Federal Government.  NIGMS supports basic biomedical research that lays the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.  With a budget of nearly $2 billion, the Institute funds more than 4,000 research grants at universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions across the country. Unlike most other NIH components, NIGMS does not conduct research in its own laboratories on the NIH campus.

The NIGMS Web site (http://www.nigms.nih.gov) plays a critical role in supporting the Institute?s mission.  The site currently receives more than 60,000 visits a month from a wide variety of users.  University-level scientists and academics, including grant applicants and recipients, are a major audience.  The site is also frequently visited by teachers and students; policymakers and their staff; NIGMS and NIH staff; staff of other government agencies and the individuals they serve; staff and members of professional societies, foundations, and organizations; print and broadcast journalists; library professionals; and the general public.

The NIGMS Web site is hosted by the NIH Center for Information Technology (CIT) on two servers.  The first, a Microsoft Content Management Server (CMS), contains the bulk of the Institute?s Web content, which is presented dynamically from a database via a collection of templates developed by CIT.  The rest of the Institute?s Web content, consisting primarily of online publications and forms, is hosted on an Active Server Page (ASP) server.  Most of the pages on this server are coded as static HTML files (with an ?.htm? file extension).  Other types of documents on this server include a number of Adobe Acrobat (PDF) files and a few ASP scripts (mainly for user feedback forms and a publication ordering form).

The templates on the Microsoft CMS use a horizontal banner graphic at the top of each page with links to a Google search box, the NIGMS and NIH home pages, a Site Map, and a Staff Contacts page, as well as tabs for accessing major sections of the site.  Pages throughout the site also include ?breadcrumb? links that serve the two-fold purpose of indicating where pages are located within the site as well as allowing visitors to easily find contextually relevant content. 

Web Coding and Design Standards

The contractor shall work with NIH/CIT Web developers and other NIGMS staff and contractors to maintain and extend the functionality of the NIGMS Web site in support of the Institute?s communications and outreach goals.

The contractor should feel free to suggest other Web technologies, when appropriate, that enhance the capabilities of the NIGMS site.  These include Macromedia Flash files, JavaScript scripts, and cascading style sheets (CSS).  However, wherever these technologies are used, standard HTML equivalents should also be available as ?defaults? if a particular user?s Web browser does not support these technologies.  For example, a Flash-enabled banner should have a standard GIF-image equivalent, and if there is a JavaScript-enabled image rollover (say, that provides a description of a graphic), there should be an ALT-attribute equivalent for that image.

Other design considerations include the following:

?	Accessibility and usability?All work by the contractor should adhere both to best practices in Web site usability engineering and to Federal standards (Section 508) regarding Web site accessibility for users of assistive technologies, as mentioned in the Web site design guidelines below.
?	Screen size?The layout for all Web pages should be optimized for a screen size of 800 by 600 pixels, in order to make the best use of the space available in a typical Web browser window on today?s computer monitors.  However, pages should ideally be flexible enough to expand or contract according to how a user resizes a browser window.
?	File size?The total file size for each Web page?including graphics, linked files (e.g., cascading style sheets, JavaScript source files, etc.)?should be no more than approximately 50 kilobytes.  This limit is to ensure that visitors connecting to the NIGMS Web site over slow dial-up connections can still access the site without unreasonable delays.
?	Fonts?Web pages should be designed using standard fonts and font sizes, as would typically be found on most Windows and Macintosh systems.
?	Colors?There is no required color scheme for either graphics or fonts used in Web pages.  However, the contractor should take into consideration issues of colorblindness and other forms of visual impairment when selecting colors.  For example, there should be adequate contrast between foreground and background colors so that icons can be clearly distinguished and text can be easily read.  Color should not be used as the sole means to convey information.
?	Cascading Style Sheets?Recommended CSS files should be used to control the attributes of text and layout elements as much as possible, in order to provide consistency across the Web site.
?	Cross-browser, cross-platform compatibility?Web pages should look as identical as possible on commonly used Web browsers, on Windows and Macintosh systems alike.  If needed, separate CSS files optimized for certain browsers should be provided.  For older browsers, the templates should still be functional and pose no impediment to accessing the navigational aids or contents of the page.

Contractor Requirements

NIGMS requires on-site contractor support for science writing, electronic content development and planning, and strategic outreach for its Web site and other electronic communication activities and products.  Specifically, the work to be performed includes, but is not limited to:

Science Writing

?	Writing and editing a variety of documents such as the NIGMS Feedback Loop electronic newsletter.
?	Editing content for the NIGMS Web site for grammar, formatting, and scientific accuracy.

Electronic Content Development and Planning
?	Determine the need for new or updated material and solicit, write, edit, clear, and post such material as appropriate.
?	Interact with technical, scientific, communications, and managerial staff and contractors at NIGMS and NIH, particularly CIT, to facilitate the involvement, input, and enthusiasm of all parties who are or will be involved in content development.  These interactions may be in person, by telephone, or via e-mail.
?	Work with NIGMS staff to consider and, when appropriate, implement their ideas regarding additions to and augmentation of Web site content and tools.
?	Organize and present the content in effective and aesthetically pleasing ways.
?	Identify appropriate uses of images, animations, and other multimedia technology on the site.  Solicit, develop, or contract for such products.  Obtain permissions to use and post this material.
?	Work with other contractors and OCPL staff to ensure that content is up-to-date and accurate and that all links on the NIGMS Web site are appropriate and functional.
?	Work with designers, graphic artists, and technical personnel from NIGMS, CIT, and other organizations (including contractors) as necessary to redesign, develop, enhance, and maintain the Web site.
?	Participate in meetings at OCPL, NIGMS, NIH, DHHS, and other parts of the Federal Government and biomedical/communications/Web communities.  Attend meetings such as the NIH Web Authors Group (WAG), CMS Users Group, American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) survey meetings, and meetings with CIT as the NIGMS or OCPL representative and report back to NIGMS staff as appropriate.  Serve on OCPL, NIGMS, NIH, or other committees as assigned.  Attend OCPL staff and other meetings.
?	Keep abreast of Web technical developments to ensure that the best, most current technologies and practices are implemented, as appropriate, on the NIGMS Web site.
?	Evaluate and recommend relevant Web design, development, and management software, hardware, and contract services; advise on justifications/purchase requests necessary to acquire and license the selected and approved items; and implement the transition to such software, hardware, and contract services.
?	Strategize new and improved features and coverage areas for the NIGMS Web site and determine how best to present these materials.
?	Recommend improvements to existing Web material.
?	Work with NIGMS staff to help them meet their Web-related communication needs.
?	Establish Web-related policies and guidelines and communicate them to NIGMS staff.

1.	Question 1: Section 2.1.1 shows 2 wireless lapel mics, and 6 handheld wireless mics, but only 6 receivers. Are the lapel mics and two of the handheld mics to share a receiver? If so, they cannot be used at the same time ? only a total of 6 wireless mics can be used at once. The system will require two additional receivers to use all 8 mics at once. 
Answer 1: Should read as 7 receivers with only 1 wireless lapel mic.
2.	Question 2: Section 2.1.2 appears to be for the equipment rack, but it also has 4 monitor speakers there. Are these the stage monitors, to be installed at the stage, or are they to be used at the equipment rack area? If so, any specifications for these? The EV QRx112/75 specified in the next section can be used as a stage monitor. 
Answer 2: Yes they are to be installed on stage.  Use of EV XW15 or similar.  
3.	Question 3: Section 2.1.2.1 has the EV QRx112/75 listed as 4 surround speakers, but they do not match or meet the specifications listed. Is there a different model speaker to be installed? 
Answer 3: The EV QRx112/75 is fine to be installed.
4.	Question 4: Section 2.1.2.2 lists a subwoofer. The model that meets those specifications is a Klipsch KPT-684 ? except it is a dual 18? model. There is no model which meets the specifications in a single 18? K-47 woofer. OK to change to a dual sub model? 
Answer 4: Change is fine.
5.	Question 5: 2.1.2.4 is for an audio/video receiver. There are already 3 amplifiers in the system. Is this to be used as the main amp for the 4 main speakers, with two of the three other amps used for the monitors, and the third used for the subwoofer? Please clarify the intended use of the power amplifiers. 
Answer 5: Yes, you are correct
6.	Question 6: 2.1.2.5 lists an I.O. processor. The specifications appear to be for a discontinued EV model. The current model is not the same. We can meet or exceed the spec?s with a different make and model (Symetrix Sym-net). This OK? Also, at the bottom, it says to be capable of receiving 16 channel mixing board audio output from band. Is this a separate mixer from the 32x4 channel one requested in 2.1.2.7? 
Answer 6: Change is fine.  Should be a 32 channel board.
7.	Question 7: 2.1.2.5 Lists an I/O expander. The specifications are exactly the same as the I/O processor. Please clarify what type of expander this is - additional inputs, or additional outputs? 
Answer 7: Expander to meet the requirement for 32 channel board
8.	Question 8: 2.2.6 The scaler/switcher specified is a Kramer VP-723DS or VP-724DS. Both have been discontinued. Replaced by VP-724xl, which has slightly different specifications. Functionality is the same, however. OK to use replacement? 
Answer 8: Change is fine.
9.	Question 9: 2.2.8 Specifications are for a Kramer TP-100 transmitter. A better model would be the TP-104, which has enough CAT-5 outputs for the three projectors. 
Answer 9: Change is Fine
10.	Question 10: 2.2.9 Specifications are exactly the same as 2.2.8. I assume a TP-200 receiver was wanted here, but there are three projectors. A better choice would be three TP-120 receivers. 
Answer 10: Change is Fine
11.	Question 11: 2.2.12 What is Optical video out?    
Answer 11: Optical Video out is a typo
12.	Question 12: On site, we had discussed the mixing board to be located at the operators station some distance away from the stage. Are the only input to this board to be the 6 wireless mics? What about any instruments at the stage? If hardwired connections from the stage are to be provided, how many are needed? Should they go into the walls, or a stage pocket? We also discussed an additional PC input, located in the front at the podium. Should we propose this as an add alt? 
Answer 12: 12 Hardwired connections through stage pocket.  Propose the PC input.

Q:  The 40ft containers that you need come in 2 sizes.  
1.  40 ft long x 8 ft wide x 8 6 ft high (40 standard container)
2.  40 ft long x 8 ft wide x 9 6 ft high (40 high cube container)

Can you take both sizes of the 40ft containers for this solicitation?  

 
A:  Yes we can   


Q:  If we have trucks that can roll-off the containers, would you still require a crane service?
