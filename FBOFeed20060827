SOLICITATION NUMBER: 	263-06-504
ISSUANCE DATE:	08/27/2006
CLOSING DATE/TIME:	4:30 pm Cairo time on 10/02/2006
POSITION TITLE:	Regional Water Advisor - Middle East and North Africa
MARKET VALUE:	GS-14 
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	2 years with possibility of extension. 
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/Cairo, Egypt
SECURITY ACCESS: 	Employment Authorization
AREA OF CONSIDERATION:	U.S. Citizens or U.S. resident aliens who are able to obtain the required security clearance.

Note: A candidate who is otherwise qualified, but does not meet full requirements of the position, may be appointed as a trainee and be required to serve at a lower grade level for the period of one year.

A. 	ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION:
Although the position requires extensive travel to the Middle East, the incumbent residence will be in Cairo, Egypt.  Cairo is the largest city in Africa and the Middle East.  It has a number of urban problems such as severe pollution, and traffic congestion.  However, it is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites, and most sports.  The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are easily reachable and provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba diving.

B.	POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR:
The Regional Water Advisor - Middle East and North Africa will be supervised by, and will report to, the Supervisory General Development Officer of the OMEP office (Office of Middle East Programs) at USAID/Cairo, Egypt.

C.	OVERVIEW:
Many countries in the Asia/Near East region, particularly those in the Middle East face a looming water crisis that is a potential source of conflict between countries.  Population growth, urbanization, industrialization, and inefficient use of water in agriculture are rapidly reducing water availability, and many countries face chronic water shortages.  

In the ANE region, agriculture employs more than 50% of the labor force and consumes 85% of the available water.  However, decreasing availability of water threatens to constrain agricultural production.  Moreover, as urban areas grow, the demand for water resources is likely to increase, requiring shifts of water away from agriculture ? a socially and politically sensitive issue.  

Financing for water infrastructure is a major challenge.  The World Bank estimates that to raise region-wide coverage to 90% for water supply and 80% for sewerage in the Middle East will require investments of $5 billion annually.  Public sector donors are expected to meet less than 5% of those requirements.  Access to clean drinking water and sanitation for much of the world will only become a reality through substantial municipal and private sector investment.  

Avoiding conflict and meeting basic human needs for water will require bold, concerted action by governments, water users, donors, and the private sector working in partnership to transform water management.  In response, under the overarching framework of the USG Strategy for the Water and Sanitation Sector that was developed in response to the requirements of the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005, USAID intends to launch a ?Blue Revolution? initiative (BRI) to promote water security in the ANE region.  This water initiative will introduce new approaches that emphasize integrated water conservation and management, collaborative problem solving of water disputes, more efficient and productive use of water, and development of alternative sources of water.  Specifically, the Blue Revolution Initiative will:

?	Promote regional communication and cooperation in water resources development and management;
?	Enhance efficiency and productivity of water use in agriculture
?	Identify and spread innovative infrastructure financing mechanisms (e.g., pooled finance, revolving funds) and disseminate good practices and successes in sustainable water development and management across the region;
?	Provide a forum for raising and discussing sensitive issues (e.g., water pricing, reuse of wastewater, regulatory reform) and strengthen technical working relationships between countries around water development issues;
?	Provide a mechanism for channeling assistance to countries dealing with trans-boundary and river basin issues in the Middle East (e.g., Tigris, Euphrates, Jordan) and Asia (e.g., Indus, Mekong) and for promoting cross-border cooperation; 
?	Establish a foundation for attracting other donor, private sector, or foundation support and increase opportunities for U.S. private investment.
USAID believes that regional solutions will play an important role in promoting water security and resolving the serious water shortages in the ANE region.  USAID will work closely with the U.S. State Department and the National Security Council to ensure the success of this regional water initiative.

Office of Middle East Programs 

USAID has established a regional platform to serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).   The Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP) allows USAID to better use its regional resources, expertise, and support services for the seven USAID Missions in the MENA region, and serves as a way for USAID to address regional challenges present throughout the region, including countries without a USAID mission.

D.	WORK DESCRIPTION:

BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION

The OMEP Regional Water Advisor (RWA), based in Cairo, Egypt, provides leadership, backstopping, and technical support for all USAID water programs in the Middle East and North Africa.  Responsibilities include supporting the development and implementation of the ANE Blue Revolution Initiative for the MENA region and supporting the design and management of OMEP?s regional water activities.  The RWA will support USAID Missions in the Middle East and their implementing partners, host country national governments, and, as appropriate, other USG agencies, and regional and international organizations that are active in the Middle East.  


DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

A.	 Strategy and Technical Support	

1.	Support the development and implementation of the ANE Blue Revolution Initiative in the Middle East/North Africa region, with a focus on: (1) improving water security, (2) expanding water supply and sanitation coverage, and (3) increasing water productivity.

2.	 Provide leadership and expert assistance to improve water management and increase access to safe water supply and sanitation services in the MENA region.  

3.	Lead efforts to assess and address policy and institutional constraints impacting on access and use of water in the MENA region, and identify priority issues requiring policy reform, such as water pricing, cost recovery, benchmarking, and regulatory reform.  Help improve public understanding and support for policy/operational changes needed to improve water and sanitation service delivery.

4.	Analyze and promote policy options for the MENA region aimed at expanding water access and sanitation services, supporting water sector regulatory development, improving water utility management and financing, improving water conservation, and resolving water conflicts.  Formulate action plans for reforming priority water supply and resource policies.  

5.	Lead efforts in identifying key challenges in water security, conservation and management in the MENA region and advise USAID missions on actions to address these challenges.  This includes supporting preparation of regional assessments of water management issues that identify potential sources of water conflict and promoting consensus-based collaborative planning and conflict resolution to address both local, national, and trans-boundary water conflicts.

6.	Work with USAID missions across the MENA region to ensure that their water-related activities and programs are consistent with the all legislation, policy priorities and regional strategies. 

7.	Provide expert assistance and backstopping in the development of concept papers, scopes of work, USAID program/project activity design documents and bilateral and multilateral agreements related to the design of water management related programs.

2.	Coordinate activities with appropriate personnel at USAID/Washington, USAID missions, U.S. Embassies and other U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. Geological Survey.  Ensure USAID?s regional initiatives complement bilateral activities.

3.	Promote innovative public-private partnerships and increased private sector participation in water development in the Middle East and North Africa in coordination with the USAID Regional Alliance Builder.

C.  Advisory Services 	

1.	Provide briefings to visitors to OMEP and other actors on the status of water resource management issues in the MENA region and USAID?s programs in this area.  Prepare and deliver presentations on the same issues to regional and international workshops and conferences. 

2.	Develop, maintain and strengthen working relationships with key partners, including national ministries, local governments, international organizations and other donors, private sector, NGOs, universities and the media to identify and implement efforts to increase synergy among the key stakeholders.  These contacts are at the senior management level.

3.	Represent the OMEP at meetings, workshops and conferences organized by various organizations, including other donors and international organizations.

4.	Prepare and disseminate, on a regular basis, to USAID missions, USAID/Washington, and program partners information on issues, accomplishments and worldwide best practices in environmental impact assessment and environmentally sound design.  Document success stories in improving environmental governance.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mr. William C. Meredith 10758 Evening Wind Ct. Columbia, MD 21044 a continuation of services being provided for OMA (Office Of Management Assessment).  Mr. Meredith is the only known source capable of providing the required services because of his involvement in this project over the past months.  Further, inherent duplication of cost to the Government would be time and cost prohibiting. PURPOSE

To provide program analysis and management support to the Division of Program Integrity in the Office of Management Assessment, National Institutes of Health (OMA/NIH).

A. BACKGROUND

The Office of Management Assessment (1) provides broad management oversight and advice to the Deputy Director for Management and NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) on management reviews, corrective actions, and NIH-wide management of activities related to regulations, delegations of authority, Privacy Act requirements, records and forms management, organizational and functional analysis, and manual issuances; (2) conducts management assessments to improve component-specific or NIH-wide management effectiveness and efficiency of administrative management functions and systems, as well as broad-based management assessments of program areas; (3) provides a centralized management review capability to promote program integrity; (4) assumes the lead responsibility on cases referred to the NIH for action by the OIG Hotline; (5) serves as the central NIH liaison on matters related to management controls and audits involving the OIG, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or Congress; and (6) has overall responsibility for all matters-including the development and implementation of policy and the Annual Management Control Plan-related to management controls to prevent fraud, waste, abuse, and conflict of interest, and develops a planned management oversight activity that focuses on early identification and prevention of such occurrences.

OMA also (1) provides a centralized management review capability to promote program integrity; (2) conducts reviews of allegations of misuse of NIH grant and contract funds; NIH grantee and contractor conflict of interest, improper employee conduct, violations of grant or contract regulations or policy that are not directly tied to misuse of funds, and issues, referred by OIG when prosecutive or civil action has been declined and/or OIG plans no further investigation; and (3) assumes the lead responsibility on cases referred to NIH for action by the OIG Hotline.
 
Note: All information pertaining to OMA reviews (e.g., the status of a review or the nature of evidence) is considered administratively confidential. The Privacy Act requires this information to be maintained in a secure manner (preferably in a locked filing cabinet). Further disclosure to NIH or non-NIH staff is permitted only on a "need-toknow" basis. Appropriate steps must be taken to prevent the release of administratively confidential information in any form (oral, electronic, or hard copy). The contractor must adhere to these requirements.

OMA's Authority to Conduct Reviews

General authority for OMA to review improper conduct is provided by the Public Health Services Act, 42 U.S.C. 282(b)(1) section 402(b)(1), which authorizes the Director, NIH, to establish and implement general policies for management and operation of program and activities within NIH. See also 42 U.S.C. Sec. 282(b)(11).

OMA's authority to conduct reviews of NIH grantees is set in 45 C.F.R. Section 74.53(e), which provides that HHS awarding agencies, the HHS Inspector General, ?the U.S. Comptroller General, or any of the duly authorized representatives "have the right of timely unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients there are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts, and copies of such documents." This right also includes "timely and reasonable access to a recipient's staff for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents."

OMA's authority to conduct reviews of NIH contractors is set forth in 48 C.F.R. section 15.106-1, 52.215-2 (and/or the terms of the contract), which provides that contractors working under contracts that are cost-reimbursement, incentive, time-and materials, labor-hour, or price redeterminable contracts, or any combination of these, are required to maintain-and the Contracting Officer, or an authorized representative, has the right to examine and audit-all records and other evidence "sufficient to reflect properly all costs claimed to have been incurred or anticipated to be incurred directly or indirectly in performance of this contract." This right of examination includes "inspection at all reasonable times of the Contractor's plants, or parts of them, engaged in performing the contract.
 
B. OBJECTIVE
DQM will obtain consulting, advisory, auditing, review, analysis, and reporting support services that would include financial, regulatory, and policy analyses and reviews. Reviews vary in scope and complexity and may encompass any or all or the following:
?	Allegations of misuse of NIU grant or contract funds. Reviews may include assessments of accounting practices and grant/contract management systems (e.g., analyses of transactions, accounts, and financial reports to evaluate compliance with applicable laws and regulations).
?	NIH grantee and contractor conflicts of interest.
?	Improper employee conduct.
?	Management control systems of NIH grantees, contractors, and internal NIH components. Reviews may include statistical sampling that can be projected to the population under study.
The objectives of the reviews are to determine compliance with laws, regulations, policies, and procedures by NIH employees, as well as by employees of NIH's grantees and contractors; determine whether employee misconduct has occurred or NIH funds have been misapplied or misused; and identify the management weaknesses that permitted the problem to occur.

C. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY

Reviews will be performed in accordance with GAO Generally Accepted Government Auditing (Yellow Book) Standards, as well as all other relevant fieldwork and reporting' standards issued by the U.S. Comptroller General and the following related references.
?	Federal Accounting Standards
?	OMB Circular A-127, Federal Financial Management Systems
?	OMB Circulars related to grants (e.g., A-21, A-110, A-133)
?	Federal Acquisition Regulation

In performing reviews, the contractor must also adhere to NIH/OMA procedures for conducting reviews (these procedures will be provided to the contractor at the entrance, conference). The contractor must exercise due professional care and sound professional judgment in the assessment of risk and the selection of appropriate procedures.

Performance under this Statement of Work will be closely coordinated with and monitored by the Project Officer (PO) or designee.
 
II. DELIVERABLES
The contractor shall contact the Project Officer/Designee within five working days after receipt of award to discuss details of assignments, obtain further information and documents as needed, and ensure a common understanding by all parties.
A. REVIEW PLANS
Within ten working days of receiving assignments from the PO or designee, the contractor will provide review plans for each assignment in accordance with OMA planning procedures and standard formats, using the GAO Yellow Book standards as guidelines. Review plans will be provided in hard copy and on a Word disk file. The PO or designee will either approve the review plan or return it for modifications within five working days of receipt.

B. WORKING PAPERS

At a date to be determined by the PO or designee, the contractor will submit working papers that contain sufficient information to enable an experienced auditor with no previous connection to the review to identify the evidence that supports the auditor's findings and conclusions.
Working papers must be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act and Records Management Requirements and the NIH Records Schedule, Sections 1700-A-2 (working papers) and 1700-A-4 (investigative/audit case files).

At the conclusion of the review, all work papers become the property of OMA. At the discretion of the contractor, the contractor may retain a copy of all working papers in accordance with the confidentiality requirements discussed in this Statement of Work. In accordance with the Privacy Act, all parties must maintain the confidentiality of these matters.

C. REPORTS

At the completion of each review, or when requested by the PO or designee, the contractor will prepare and submit reports within the time frames established by the PO or designee. These reports must comply with OMA reporting procedures, standards, and formats and must be provided in hard copy and in Word disk file format. The PO or designee will provide either written or oral comments that will be for the contractor's consideration and will not compromise the contractor's professional responsibilities or judgment. The PO or designee will provide guidance regarding any additional steps needed to complete the review.
 
These reports may represent the results of reviews performed wholly within an NIH Institute or Center (IC), in more than one such organization, or on-site at the location of NIH contractors or grantees. Reports will include, as appropriate, findings, conclusions, recommendations, and any additional comments and information that may be necessary to describe the activity under review and support recommended corrective actions. The reports may include recommendations to improve program operations. The contractor may also be required to provide oral reports and to develop special reports that identify program deficiencies requiring immediate corrective action.
OMA uses a two-stage report process that includes a Draft Report and a Final Advisory Report. The contractor may be required to prepare any or all of the following reports:

1.	The Draft Report, which OMA sends to the subject of the review and to the NIH IC Director for review and comment.
2.	The Final Advisory Report, which may incorporate comments made by the subject of the review and the IC, and which is a pre-decisional advisory document for NIH management officials. It is sent to the Director of the involved IC, who may or may not concur with any recommendations.

All reports should
?	clearly describe issues (including management control issues), applicable criteria, findings, conclusions, and recommendations;
?	include sufficient detail to convince a general audience of the validity and significance of the facts, conclusions, and recommendations; and
?	contain an index linking each major issue to supporting working papers.

OMA also uses Management Advisory Reports to notify IC Directors that it has conducted a review and found no merit to the allegations. These will include findings and conclusions and any additional comments and information necessary to describe the work performed.


III. PROGRESS REPORTS

The contractor shall furnish monthly progress reports to the PO or designee. Once a month, the contractor will meet with the PO or designee and other OMA representatives, as appropriate, to discuss progress and any potential problems. These meetings will be informal and will provide the opportunity for interaction among all parties. At the PO's discretion, the contractor will also provide verbal briefings to OMA representatives.
 
IV. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

The contractor must possess a minimum of ten years of analytical experience at the senior level and should also have experience in program analysis and evaluation, cost accounting, financial accounting, statistics, corporate finance, budgeting, acquisitions, contracting, and operations management. The contractor must have extensive working knowledge of the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards issued by the U.S. Comptroller General; management theories and practices, such as auditing and accounting principles and practices; and methods and techniques for planning and conducting evaluations of NIH intramural and extramural activities. The contractor will be required to develop or modify methods and techniques to resolve a variety of review problems.
The contractor will be required to possess comprehensive knowledge of developing review approaches and techniques for the planning, execution, and reporting phases, including preparing review plans, selecting or modifying review techniques, and preparing reports. The contractor
will exercise due professional care in establishing the scope, selecting the methodology, and choosing tests and procedures for the reviews.

The contractor should also possess the following:
?	Demonstrated experience in working with HHS and federal regulations, policies, and guidelines applicable to federal employees, grantees, and contractors.
?	Working knowledge of statistical sampling techniques and financial analyses.
?	Knowledge and skills in identifying instances of legislative or regulatory noncompliance and
the ability to articulate findings in a concise, logical, and convincing manner.
?	Ability to prepare clear and concise written materials, conduct interviews for the purpose of
giving or receiving information, lead conferences/briefings, and make presentations.
?	Extensive working knowledge of the use of computer software, including spreadsheets,
TeamMate, and DPI databases, word processing, electronic mail, and the Internet.


V. LOCATION OF WORK

The contractor will perform the work in the OMA offices. Some work will be performed at NIH grantees' and contractors' facilities, or at other NIH office locations.


VI. LEVEL OF EFFORT

OMA is requesting 847 hours of service from the contractor. Unless otherwise authorized by the PO or designee, the contractor is expected to work eight hours each working day, or close to full-time between the hours of 8:00 am and 6:00 p.m.
 
VII. CONTRACTOR TRAVEL

The contractor shall travel under the same rules and regulations as federal employees. The one exception is that "contract airlines" are not required to honor contract airfares for non-federal personnel, even those who travel on official Government business.

The delivery order under this Statement of Work will not provide funds for commuting to the Rockville work site, including travel for relocation to the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area; for interviews conducted by OMA to select the contractor; or for return trips home for any contractor who lives outside normal commuting range.

If the contractor needs to conduct site visits to NIH grantees or contractors outside the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, he/she must obtain prior approval from the PO, and OMA will provide funding under a separate purchase agreement.
This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit  and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest  and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.
