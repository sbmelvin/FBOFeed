(2) Electronic form means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all affected systems. Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests.

(3) Payment request means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input. Information regarding WAWF is available on the Internet at https://wawf.eb.mil/.
(c) The Contractor may submit a payment request and receiving report using other than WAWF only when--

(2) DoD is unable to receive a payment request or provide acceptance in electronic form;

(d) The Contractor shall submit any non-electronic payment requests using the method or methods specified in Section G of the contract.
(e) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payments requests.

The contractor shall register to use WAWF-RA at https://wawf.eb.mil.  There is no charge to use WAWF.

<DESC>The NASA Subsonic Rotary Wing Fundamental Aeronautics Program and the Army ResearchLaboratory Vehicle Technology Directorate have identified a need for a research tooldirected toward improved understanding of gear and bearing surface failure diagnostics inrotorcraft transmissions.   More specifically the NASA and Army research team requires ananalytical tool capable of simulating, via appropriate software tool, the vibratorybehavior of gears and bearings having surface defects representative a fatigue spalls. This procurement seeks to obtain a user-friendly computing tool that will represent avirtual test capability for conducting fundamental analytical research for a widevariety of gear and bearing designs arranged as a planetary gear system. Presently the NASA and Army team conducts simulations of gear and bearing dynamics via amultibody dynamic contact analysis code Calyx from Advanced Numerical Solutions.   Theexisting analysis tool package can simulate only undamaged gears and bearings whenanalyzing for dynamic behavior.  The need is for an analysis tool or tools (softwaremodules) that can make use of existing models for planetary gear systems with anenhancement to modify the model via a user-friendly toolset to define a fault, conduct adynamic simulation, and then post-process the simulation results to summarized thedynamic gear and bearing forces and to also post-process the data to summarize the motion(vibration) at a point on the gear- or bearing- support structure where a vibrationsensor might be mounted for health monitoring.Detailed SOW:The government seeks to purchase a computer simulation tool (software) module or modulesthat can be executed on a personal computing (PC) platform.  The intent of the softwaretool (the capability that will be enabled) is to simulate the effect of surface pitslocated on gears or bearings on the synamic behavior of planetary gear systes.	Theapproach shall be a two-dimensional finite-element based approach.  The software package(executable code, user manuals, and example model sets defining example-model inputs)shall have the following research capabilities and requirements.   1.  The vendor shall develop the ability to describe a surface defect as a perturbationto a finite element model of a perfect (undamaged) gear tooth, rolling element, orbearing race. The analytical tool needs to able to specify one or more pits, onindividual teeth (or rollers).	The profile of the surface defect must be described insufficient detail such that the providers contact solver will properly emulate thesurface profile for purposes of computing the contact force directions and separations. In other words, the influence of the surface defect on the computed contact vector forcemagnitude and direction must be calculated during the dynamic analysis. 2.  The software module or modules for dynamic analysis models having a surface defectsshall incorporate a method to complete calculations until steady state is reached, thenstudy the frequency spectrum of reaction forces. 3.  The software module or modules for bearing analysis must be capable of modelingcylindrical rolling element bearing with surface defects, with deformable (finiteelement) contact models incorporating the effect of contact between the rollers andraces. The races small be modeled as deformable. The inertial properties of the cageshould be included. The cage may be modeled as a rigid element. 4.  The user shall be able to specify surface defects on individual teeth/rollers orspecific points on the bearing raceway. The user shall be able to specify differentdefects on individual teeth, raceway elements, or rollers. The underlying finite elementmodel must not be modified but the contact solver must model the defect geometry and theresulting change in the contact force vector. The defect specification should be capableof using data imported from a profilometer inspection of a real part.  The user shallalso have the option to define a defect using parameters via a Graphical User Interface(GUI).	5.  The developer shall conduct example analyses to study the effects of surface defectson the races or rollers on the frequency spectrum of the bearing reaction forces. 6.  The model definition for the gear must be 100% compatible with the gear softwareprogram CALYX-Planetery2D  from Advanced Numerical Solution.	The compatibilityrequirement will allow NASA and Army researchers to make use of the extensive database ofmodels already available and built up by the research team.7.  The developer shall conduct example cases and document the contact solver resolutionsrequired such as to provide guidance for running analysis cases with appropriate contactsolver solutions.8.  The user shall be able to save the analysis results in a file that can later bepost-processed using the including contact forces and contact pressure distributions,stress at any point in the FEA model as a function of time, stress as a function ofposition in the root-fillet region of the gear,  and finite element model displacements. The post-processing capabilities and execution shall be presented to the user via aGraphical User Interface.  The post-processed data shall be presented as X-Y plots orhistograms as appropriate in a manner that can be copied and pasted in the MicrosoftWindows environment  (for example a graph shall be capable of being copied and pastedinto a Microsoft Word document) via a few keyboard keystrokes or mouse device clicks.9.  The user shall be able to read the analysis results file and conduct post-processingof the results via the IGlass software tool.	This tool allows to create color codedplots of finite element meshes, resultant stresses, and displacement distributions.  Theresults in IGlass are depicted on the geometry representations of the gear and bearingmodels.The final deliverables of the purchase will be:1.  Executable software code and license that will permit the software to operate on aPersonal Computer (PC)2.  At least one example of a planetary gear system having a surface pit located on agear shall be provided in electronic format.3.  At least one example of a planetary gear system having a surface pit located on abearing shall be provided in electronic format.4.  The vendor shall provide a report that will serve as a user manual.  Also the reportshall document example analysis cases results that will demonstrate that the softwaremeets the requirements of the SOW. Required by:  Aug 10, 2010NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Advanced Numerical Solutions, 3956 Brown ParkDr., Hilliard, OH 43026.  The GRC Mechanical Components Branch has access to the CALYX and IGlass software packageexecutables (permanent license) as a result of an Army SBIR project.  The CALYX softwarepackage is currently not capable of analyzing a planetary gear system having pittingdamage.  The need to do such an analysis has been defined in the Background section ofthe procurement SOW.  A requirement of the SOW includes compatibilities with the CALYXand IGlass software modules that were developed via SBIR program.  The softwarespecification to allow such compatibility is the exclusive proprietary rights of theAdvanced Numerical Solutions Company and is protected via the provisions of the SBIRprogram.  The CALYX software package source code is required to accomplish the task asdefined, and only this contractor has access and control of the source code.  Althoughone can imagine developing similar tools to those defined in the SOW for other generalpurpose finite element analysis tools, the cost for purchasing such a license and thetraining of GRC person to operate another software package would greatly exceed theexpected cost of this task.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the SimplifiedAcquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. The Sole Source is under the authority of FAR reference 13.106-1(b)1. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon January 5, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:maria.e.rodriguez@usace.army.mil">US Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston</a>
<DESC>This solicitation is issued as an UNRESTRICTED Request for Proposal for LARGE BUSINESS concerns for Design-Build Horizontal Construction Services.  This solicitation will be evaluated under the Design-Build two-phase process utilizing best value trade-off acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>The Galveston District intends to award two or more Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) to Large Businesses under the Unrestricted pool, with an estimated workload value of approximately $495,000,000.00 for SWG and SWD customers as follows:  Civil Works, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) mission area.  The contracts will contain a base period plus four one-year options for the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers Southwestern Division (SWD) for design-build, design-bid-build and construction services with an estimated maximum task order limitation of $100 million and a minimum task order limitation of $3 thousand.  The minimum guarantee for the unrestricted MATOCs is $3000 and it only applies to the base period. <BR><BR>The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  The solicitation will be a two-phase negotiated acquisition; there will not be a public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government.  <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the majority of the work will be limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  However, because SWD Services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic restriction, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure execution gaps can be covered, therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute up to an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical areas as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement.  <BR><BR>Scope of Work:  The MATO contracts are intended for multi-tasking of horizontal construction services for a wide variety of new construction, maintenance, repair, and alteration projects for Civil, Military, and International and Interagency Support (IIS) Projects.  The work will include, but is not limited to anchored earth retention, breakwaters, jetties, spillways, bulkheads, embankments, dikes, flood control channels and structures, marine related structures such as gates and locks, dams, levees, as well as anti-terrorism and force protection, outdoor recreation facilities, park and recreational open space improvements.<BR><BR><BR>This requirement is part of the total MATOC program requirements for Horizontal Construction in the Southwestern Division (SWD) of approximately $950M all contracts combined to provide capacity to support the execution of SWD's horizontal construction, workload missions, including horizontal construction missions associated with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) signed into law on February 20, 2009.  There must be more than two awards to create a Historically Under-Utilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), 8(a) Small Disadvantaged (SDB) or unrestricted large business pool to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless not set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be award.  <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the Product Delivery Team will consider 1) the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.<BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the four contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until: 1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that one or more of the task orders under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.  <BR><BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two-Phase Design Build Process.  The first phase consists of a process known in the commercial design-build industry as the Request for Qualifications or acronym:  RFQ.  (This solicitations refers to it as Phase1.)  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offeror's) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ MATO contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposal in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will short-list no more than five of the Phase 1 Offerors to compete for the design-build MATO contracts in Phase 2 of the process.<BR><BR>In Phase 2 the selected Offeror's will submit the remainder of the technical/ performance capability proposals and a price proposal for a seed project.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation and award the contracts to the responsible Offerors whose proposal conforms with all terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government considering technical design quality, performance capability and/or cost.<BR><BR>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction) which corresponds to Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 1629.  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million. <BR><BR><BR>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 17 Jun 2009 under solicitation number W912HY-09-R-0023.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS
The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to conduct the study Pilot Study of Aerial High-Definition Video Surveys for Seabirds, Marine Mammals and Sea Turtles on the Atlantic OCS.  The anticipated period of performance will be two years from the effective date of the contract.  The estimated budget for this project is between $700,000 and $900,000.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541990:  All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  
PURPOSE:  The MMS seeks to develop a safe, effective, affordable and scientifically valid sampling protocol for high-definition video aerial transect surveys to determine seasonal and annual variation in distributions and abundances of birds along the Atlantic coast of the United States from the shoreline to 30 miles offshore and to test the utility of the technique for surveys of marine mammals and sea turtles.  Because the technology is recent, there is no established best protocol for conducting such aerial surveys.  The MMS wishes to build on the European experience by initiating a pilot study that will:
1)  develop a recommended sampling protocol for such surveys, 2)  field test and evaluate different combinations of aircraft, high-definition video camera systems, camera mounting systems and control systems suitable for such surveys and recommend one or more of these combinations3)  evaluate and recommend onboard data recording and storage systems, 4)  determine and describe a calibration method for obtaining and maintaining desired transect width at flight altitudes of 300 to 600 meters, and  5)  develop software to automate the analysis of digitally-recorded aerial video surveys.
Aircraft evaluations may consist of review of literature and technical specifications to identify aircraft and camera/control systems likely to be most suitable, but should also include actual flight testing of selected aircraft.  Flight tests should evaluate maneuverability, safety, and flight performance characteristics of aircraft fully loaded with all hardware and flight crew necessary to collect and record the video data.  
SCOPE OF WORK:  In Task 1, the Contractor shall collect relevant data and information to evaluate the potential of various aircraft for safe and efficient conduct of aerial surveys offshore on the Atlantic OCS.  For Task 2, the Contractor shall evaluate existing high definition video cameras and mounting systems for effectiveness in a marine environment, convenience of use and in-flight maintenance, and compatibility with the aircraft selected in Task 1.  In Task 3, the Contractor shall develop protocols for calibration of camera controls to obtain and maintain desired transect width at known flight altitudes.  For Task 4, the Contractor shall evaluate and recommend onboard digital data recording systems suitable for aerial surveys using the selected aircraft.  In Task 5, within available resources, the Contractor shall determine the flight characteristics and performance of selected aircraft with all necessary payload (including camera(s), mounting and control systems, data recording systems, and flight crew) to determine safety and maneuverability of fully-loaded aircraft.  For Task 6, the Contractor shall propose an aerial survey transect grid or series of grids that constitute a scientifically valid and economically efficient sampling protocol to estimate seasonal and annual changes in distributions and abundances of seabirds from the Maine/Canada border to Miami, FL and from the coast to 30 miles offshore.  In Task 7, the Contractor shall develop software to automate the analysis of digitally-recorded video data to the extent possible.  For Task 8, the Contractor shall evaluate the effectiveness of high definition video aerial surveys for detecting and estimating abundances of birds, marine mammals and sea turtles. In Task 9, the Contractor shall develop and present an estimate of the total cost per square mile surveyed, including all costs from travel and payroll to flight costs, hardware, and data analysis costs.  For Task 10, the Contractor shall synthesize the data and information gathered, prepare a final report, and, as appropriate, write and submit an article(s) describing the research results to a peer-reviewed journal. 
HOW TO RESPOND:  In order to compete for this contract interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement detailing: (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and /or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience. The Offeror shall provide information on which tasks each key person shall perform, qualifications for completing those tasks, and the rationale for that assignment.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; A FULLY DEVELOPED TECHNICAL AND PRICE QUOTATION IS NEITHER NECESSARY NOR DESIRED. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. THIS CONTEMPLATED PROCUREMENT IS ANTICIPATED TO UTILIZE THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) OF 2009 FUNDING IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT RESPONSIBLE SOURCES CAN SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT.<br />All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to this notice; however, sources that do not respond shall not be precluded from responding to any subsequent solicitation.<br /><br />The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) has a need for a high performance Multipurpose Laser System and Microscopy System (ML&amp;MS) to be used as part of NIST's research and measurements in a wide range of areas, including study of the structure and function of enzymes involved in alternative fuel production, study of fundamental interactions of ultrafast light pulses with matter, development of new quantum computing and atomic clock technologies. NIST is especially interested in responses from integrating vendors who can propose to provide the entire Multipurpose Laser and Microscopy System, including all components of all five major subsystems. The integrating vendor will be responsible for manufacturing or&nbsp;acquiring, assembling, testing, installing, and providing technical support after installation for the subsystems at NIST facilities in Boulder, Colorado. However, responses are also solicited from vendors who may be able to provide only parts of the entire Multipurpose System. All responses should clearly specify that the vendor is potentially interested in providing all parts of the Multipurpose System, or should clearly specify which parts of the Multipurpose System the vendor is interested in providing.</p>
<p>Responses from responsible sources should clearly establish capability of providing Multipurpose Laser and Microscopy Sytems and components. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for an ML&amp;MS that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that result&nbsp;would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The ML&amp;MS should have higher end functional capabilities envisioned in the minimal specifications outlined below for each of the major subsystems included in this equipment suite. Responses should establish that vendors are capable of meeting NIST requirements through their capabilities of manufacture, acquisition, and/or integration of equipment or equipment suites, installation, and support of the equipment.</p>
<p>The ML&amp;MS is comprised of five major subsystems as listed below. Only very general specifications for each of the five major subsystems are provided below. The full solicitation will contain detailed specifications for each of the major components.</p>

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this request is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services.   The Small Business Size is $25 Million.  SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. Include whether or not you are a small business; HUBZone small business; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small business; women-owned small business; or small disadvantaged business in order to assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.

1.  INTRODUCTION

The DOL, OWCP, Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation (DFEC) has a need to allow injured Federal employees and their employing agencies to electronically file DFEC forms through the Internet using common WEB browsers. The capability envisioned would enable the following functionality:

1.  Easy access for an injured claimant to electronically file and track the     submission status  of a claim using the internet
	
2.  Allow claimant to electronically submit supporting documents using commonly available file formats

3.  Allow claimant’s supervisor to electronically review and approve the claim submission

4.  Allow authorized employing agency representative to review, approve, and submit a claim to DFEC 

5.  Provide agency reporting capabilities

OWCP has determined that the Adobe LiveCycle tool will be used to provide the necessary forms data capture capabilities.  This notification is a Request for Information (RFI) from industry vendors regarding their capabilities and interest in providing the LiveCycle product and tools, developing the WEB based interface, work flow capability, and providing training for current staff.   

2.  BACKGROUND

The Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation (OWCP/DFEC) administers the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA).  FECA provides workers’ compensation coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers including wage replacement, medical and vocational rehabilitation benefits for work-related injury and occupational disease.  Compensation claims filed under the FECA are processed by DFEC’s 12 District offices around the nation.  

The process for filing, validating and submitting a claim to DFEC is the responsibility of the individual Federal agencies.  Some agencies, depending on budget and IT staff availability, have developed electronic submission capabilities while other agencies rely on paper submissions.  The ECOMP project is being implemented to allow all agencies to reduce their reliance on paper by enabling the injured worker (claimant) to fill out and file a claim electronically using any computer connected to the internet.  Once a claim has been filed, ECOMP will provide agencies with a basic claims management capability to track the status of the claim and allow for an approval work flow, as well as reporting tools. 

3.  INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED 

DOL is requesting information from vendors regarding their capabilities to provide the Adobe LiveCycle product, and their technical ability to use the LiveCycle product to develop an electronic claims submission and tracking system. Responses to this RFI should address the following:
1.	Provide your company’s name and address; size of company (number of personnel, finances, small or large business (8(a), etc.) and point(s) of contact (Name, Phone Number, Address, email, etc.).
2.	Identify the location of the facility you would propose to perform the work covered in Section 4.
3.	Responses from small businesses must address adherence to the federal requirement of 50% prime contractor performance on contracts.  Small businesses must not be unduly dependent on support from large business subcontracts or teaming arrangements.
4.	Identify your firm’s availability on GSA Schedules or other Federal government contracting vehicles.
Responses should address the high-level requirements from Section 5.
5.	Describe your technical approach in implementing the processes and functions in Section 4 with the expected volumes provided. Also provide a description of demonstrated experience (in the past three years) deploying applications using the Adobe LiveCycle product and providing training in the use of the Adobe LiveCycle product. 
6.	Estimate the price for development/implementation of the application based on the requirements outlined in Section 5.  Provide recommendations and estimate pricing for LiveCycle training for current staff.
7.	Describe your experience interfacing with complex case management/claims processing systems and developing Web interfaces with other systems using the Adobe LiveCycle tool.
8.	Describe your experience implementing and performing successfully on performance-based contracts.

4.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor will be able to sell directly to the government the Adobe Live Cycle Enterprise Suite 2 solution.

The solution should include a development tool for designing the form interface and implementing business logic within the form as well as providing status and workflow. 

The Contractor will provide a services solution that meets the following general requirements:
The contractor will also provide the initial consultant services necessary to develop the form submission portal for ECOMP and make it available to the authorized user community via the WEB.  

The contractor will, using the Adobe LiveCycle tool, develop a basic claim submission and work flow application comprised of no less than 6 DFEC and OSHA forms (CA-1, CA-2, CA-7, CA-7A , CA-7B, OSHA 301).  The application will at a minimum provide the following functionality:

o	Allow data entry with appropriate field level edits to ensure data content
o	Allow ability for claimant to partially fill out a form, leave the application, and return to the same point at a later time
o	Allow for uploading of supporting documents
o	Send an e-mail with a link to the supervisor’s e-mail address as provided by the claimant
o	Allow ability to track claim submission status

Facility:

OWCP anticipates Vendor will work on site at the DOL facility at 200 Constitution Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20210.  If Vendor anticipates doing the work at any other location, please specify the location, capabilities, and distance to the DOL facility and any access restrictions for Government staff or authorized contractors.  

Technical Requirements:

Security

Claim forms submitted by Claimants contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  The proposed system shall limit access to PII data.  A Claimant may access their own data only, Supervisors may access claims forms submitted by their subordinates only as identified by the Claimant, and Injury Compensation Specialists may access claims forms for their agency only.  The system must be designed to prevent use of the Web interface by any automated external program.  The system shall integrate with other claim processing and E-Case file systems; the system shall validate specified users employing either Active Directory or LDAP.

Volume and Turnaround 

The Division of Federal Employees' Compensation adjudicates new claims for benefits and manages ongoing cases; pays medical expenses and compensation benefits to injured workers and survivors; and helps injured employees return to work when they are medically able to do so.

In FY 2009, 139,874 new cases were created. The program provided 264,000 workers and survivors approximately $2.4 billion in benefits for work-related injuries or illnesses. Of these benefit payments, over $1.6 billion was for wage-loss compensation, $668 million for medical and rehabilitation services, and $129 million for death benefit payments to surviving dependents.

The forms received through the ECOMP system will be used to initiate claims.  The CA-1 and CA-2 claim forms result in the creation of new FECA compensation cases. Cases must be created and notification returned to the claimant’s agency within 48 hours of receipt of the claim forms by the DFEC.

5.  INSTRUCTIONS AND RESPONSE GUIDELINES

The response must be specific to the requirements in Section 4 listed above to demonstrate that the respondent has the requisite skills and experience.  Experience and past performance is requested of qualified, prime respondents; partner or team member capabilities should be addressed separately.

<DESC>THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN INTEREST IN A NO COST CONTRACT, WHICH INCLUDES A BASE YEAR AND FOUR ONE-YEAR OPTIONS. THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO MAKE AWARD TO ONE CONTRACTOR.
1. PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR CONTRACTOR FAST ACCESS PROJECT
(a) The Camp Pendleton Contractor Fast Access Project is designed to maintain installation security and provide contractors servicing Camp Pendleton a method to more quickly gain access to Camp Pendleton to conduct official business.  A key component of this Project is the completion of background checks on participating companies and their employees. Participation in this Project is voluntary at this time. Hereafter, the Camp Pendleton Contractor Fast Access Project will be known as the "Project"; the company selected for this contract shall be known as the "Contractor"; companies and individuals participating in the Project shall be known as "Participants"; and Camp Pendleton shall be referred to as the "Government".
(b) The Contracting Officer is the sole entity authorized to approve companies and individuals to participate in this Project. As part of the Project, the Contractor shall conduct background checks on Participants and their employees for whom an identification badge is requested. The approximate number of requests each month is estimated at 500, but this figure is subject to change.  The Participant will determine the specific employees selected for background checks.  The Contractor shall accomplish background checks on the Participant Company and its selected employees upon approval from the Government and enrollment of the company into the program.  Background checks on Participant employees shall be conducted at the time of the employee's registration and annually thereafter, for as long as enrollment continues.  Contractor employees employed for period of greater than one year should have their contractor provided background reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractor's expense. Background checks shall be performed in accordance with the Government's specifications as listed below.  Payment for participation in the Project, including setting up the account and performing the background checks, shall be by the Participants. There shall be no charge to the Government by the Contractor for the performance of this contract. The Government shall have no liability for agreements entered into by the Contractor and any Participant, nor shall the Government have any liability for the safeguarding of private information collected on Participants by the Contractor for this program.    
(c) The Contractor shall provide a method for Participant companies to enroll in the program. Enrollment of new Participants and safeguarding any private information about the Participant Company or its employees is exclusively the responsibility of the Contractor.  Enrollment shall be made available at the Main Gate, San Luis Rey Gate, and Police Administration Services Office.
(d) The Contractor shall provide identification (ID) badges to all Participant personnel for whom background checks have been conducted and who have met the Government's criteria as set forth below.  The identification badge shall be of common ID card size and use radio frequency identification technology (RFID), or a similar technology that is capable of tracking the ingress and egress to Camp Pendleton by participating cardholders.  This ID badge shall contain the Participant's employee's color photo, full name, expiration date (not to exceed one year), and the name of the participating company. It shall also contain a logo of Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton design, and a statement that the card may only be used for official business.  The Director, Support Services Division, Security & Emergency Services, Camp Pendleton, must approve final design of the ID card after contract award.   
(e) The Contractor shall provide all equipment and necessary communications connections to establish a system to remotely detect and record issued Participant ID cards entering or departing the Camp Pendleton area. Equipment shall be stationed at eight Access Control Point (ACP) locations (see paragraph 5 below) and capable of alerting ACP personnel to expired or cancelled Participant ID cards. It shall also be capable of displaying for ACP personnel, at his or her location, a photo of the Participant cardholder separate and independent from that on the ID card.  ACP personnel must be able to view the photo and still maintain control of traffic inside the ACP control zone. Contractor will provide training to guard personnel on use of equipment at no additional cost.  Other than a single identification number, no electronic data concerning the Participant's identity shall be stored on the Participant's ID card.  Participant data may only be stored on medium under the control of the Contractor or Camp Pendleton.  Camp Pendleton personnel may safeguard data storage equipment but the Contractor shall ensure that such Camp Pendleton personnel do not have access to Participant data, except data transmitted to ACP personnel used to verify the Participant's ID card.  The Contractor will not be allowed to connect or access any of its equipment to any Government communications equipment or networks.  The Contractor's system must be a stand-alone system. The Government may at a later date authorize the Contractor access to its communications system to enable the system to be compatible with the Government's Common Access Card, however, this is not guaranteed. The Contractor may not use data and private information on participating companies and employees assembled and maintained under this program for any purpose other than those stated in this contract, without written permission of the Participant.  Individual participating companies and employees may authorize the Contractor to use their personal background information, which is not related in any manner to the Participant's activity on Camp Pendleton, for other purposes under separate agreements.  Requiring such other use(s) shall not be a requirement for participation in the Project. 
(f) Contractor, upon receiving any status change regarding employees, which is reported to the contractor by the participants, must have the capability of reporting such change to the gates, at the speed of which electronic communications travels.  Delays in reporting such change can be detrimental to the security of the base.
2. BACKGROUND SCREENING
 Upon completion of the registration process the Contractor shall conduct a background screening on the participating company and selected employees.  Specific steps in the background screening shall be as follows:
(a) Verify that the participating company is licensed, bonded and maintains appropriate insurance.   
(b) Identity verification of Participant employee through social security number trace to determine that the individual is legally eligible to work in the United States and the participant employee has a valid social security number associated with him/her and that the number is not associated with a deceased person, infant, multiple persons, etc.
 (c) Review county, state and federal records to determine if the Participant employee has been convicted of a crime in any of the counties in which he/she has resided during the past 10 years.  Searches shall be conducted to locate any existing county, state or federal criminal convictions.  Available national databases shall also be searched.  If any felony conviction is found to have occurred within the last 10 years, the individual shall be disqualified and the Contractor shall not issue an ID card to the employee.  Whether a state or local conviction constitutes a felony shall be determined based on the laws of the state in which the conviction occurred.  Whether a federal conviction constitutes a felony shall be based on federal laws.
(d)  Sexual offender registries for the county that the Participant employee currently resides shall be searched.  If the employee is listed, the individual shall be disqualified and the Contractor shall not issue an ID card to that employee.
(e) The Participant employee's name, address, date of birth and social security number shall be submitted to the National Law Enforcement Submission that is accessed by State Department of Corrections, Federal Bureau of Prisons. ATF, Drug Enforcement Agency, Internal Revenue Service, Postal Inspectors, State Police Departments, State Bureaus of Investigations, Sheriff's Departments and Local Police Departments, FBI and INS. 
(f) Once it has been determined that no disqualifying event exists, the Participant employee shall be issued an identification card by the Contractor.    If there is a disqualifying event, no ID card shall be issued to the individual.  (g)  A disqualifying event is any one or more of the following:	Identity verification failure from social security number traceConvicted of any felony within the past 10 yearsApplicant is listed on a sexual offender registryApplicant has an outstanding criminal warrant 
(h) The Participant employee shall be notified in writing if there is a disqualifying event and shall be provided a thirty-day adverse action period within which to resolve any disagreements with the findings from the background check.  At the end of the 30-day period, if a disqualifying event has not been removed (e.g., expunged from his/her record), the applicant shall be denied participation in the Project and no ID card shall be issued.  A further appeal may be addressed to the Government on a case-by-case basis.
3. REPORTS TO THE COR

Contractor shall notify the COR immediately upon discovery of equipment down time.  The Government is responsible for safeguarding equipment provided by the Contractor to the Government. Any damage to Contractor equipment caused by Government personnel acting within the scope of their employment, will be the responsibility of the Contractor.  The Government will be responsible for damage caused by negligent acts or omissions of its employees.  The Government shall not be liable for damage caused by third parties unless negligence on the part of the Government caused the loss or damage.  The Government will, in its sole discretion, determine whether negligence is involved.
5. ACCESS CONTROL POINTS.  The following are the locations of the 8 ACPs at which Participant ID cards will be required to be validated and recorded as they enter and depart.  	a.

The Contractor's Quality Control Plan shall provide the Contractor's management with an effective and efficient means of identifying and correcting problems throughout the entire scope of contract operations.  The Quality Control Plan shall include:

(b)  QUALITY ASSURANCE.  The Quality Assurance (QA) Program is implemented by the Government to evaluate the output quality and responsiveness of the Contractor to ensure that the Government receives services in accordance with the terms of the contract.  The Government's quality assurance program is not a substitute for the quality control program implemented and administered by the Contractor.  Each phase of the services rendered under this contract is subject to Government inspection during both the Contractor's operations and after completion of tasks.  The Government may employ any method of quality assurance it deems appropriate, to include random sampling and customer complaint.  The Government may sample a percentage of the fast access population or a predetermined number, quarterly or at any other time periodicity deemed appropriate.  As part of quality assurance, the Government may conduct its own background checks; no criminal history or warrants at pre-enrollment should be found on any of the Government sample population.  The Contracting Officer or his authorized representative may conduct necessary inspections during contractor's daily hours of operation for the purpose of determining satisfactory performance.  At the Contracting Officer's discretion, inspections may be conducted jointly with the contractor's supervisor.  Initial inspections will result in reports listing any existing unsatisfactory conditions found.  A re-inspection(s) may be conducted to ensure that corrective action has been taken.  The contractor or his representative will be informed of inspection results.  If the contractor desires, he may accompany the party during the re-inspection(s).  All areas found to be unsatisfactory may be checked during any subsequent inspection or re-inspection for corrective action.
7. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT, CONTRACTOR AND CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL
    	(a) The Government and the contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract are non-personal services and that no employer-employee or master-servant relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the contractor or between the Government and the contractor's personnel.  Further, the contractor is not the Government's agent.    	 (b) The Government will not exercise any supervision or control over contractor personnel performing services under this contract.  Contractor personnel shall not become an integrated part of the Government organization in connection with performance under this contract.     	 (c)  The services to be performed under this contract do not require the contractor or his employees to exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the Government, but rather, the contractor's employees shall act and exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the contractor. (d)  Contractor personnel shall not be eligible, by virtue of performance under this contract, for payment by the Government of entitlements and benefits accorded federal employees.  The entire consideration to the contractor for performance of this contract is contained in the provisions for payment set forth in this contract.
8. EMPLOYMENT OF ALIENS 
The contractor shall not hire any individual to perform work on Camp Pendleton or any other Government installation under this contract unless such individual is a citizen of the United States or is lawfully admitted into the United States and authorized to work in the United States.  The contractor shall comply with 8 USC 1324a, 8 CFR Part 274a, and any other laws and regulations pertaining to the employment of aliens.  If acceptable documentary evidence is not provided within the required time, the contractor shall not allow the affected employee(s) to perform work on Camp Pendleton or any other Government installation under this contract until after such acceptable documentary evidence is presented to the Contracting Officer.  Removal of any employee(s) from performance of work pursuant to this provision shall not relieve the contractor of the responsibility to perform all work under this contract in a timely manner.
9. CONTRACTOR AND SUBCONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE COMPLIANCE WITH INSTALLATION RULES AND REGULATIONS. 
 	(a) The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that each of its subcontractors fully complies with the following provisions, and shall flow down to subcontracts a clause to satisfy this contractual obligation.  
(b) The Contractor is responsible for providing information required obtaining clearances, permits, passes, or security badges required for Contractor personnel or equipment access.  This includes information required for police or background checks or investigations and all other requirements of the issuing activity.  
(c)  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring such clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.  
(d) All Contractor personnel performing work under this contract who require access to military installations shall obtain personal entry and vehicle passes from the Provost Marshall's Office (PMO) of each base.  For Camp Pendleton, this process includes the requirement that employees under a contract of one year or longer obtain a Business Pass, which requires completion of an application used to conduct background checks.  
(e) The Commanding General of each base has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant personal entry passes or may bar Contractor employees, including employees who have been granted a personal entry pass.  Refusal to grant an employee a personal entry pass or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.
(f) The Contractor's employees shall observe and comply with all base rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract.  
(g) Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the contracting officer. 
(h) Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks.  Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by Military Police or other security or safety personnel.
10. CHANGES IN FUTURE REQUIREMENTS 
(a) Increased or Decreased Requirements.  The Government reserves the right to add or delete requirements based on the following, which may result in increased or decreased requirements within the areas served by this contract.  This clause constitutes notice of the possibility of contract modifications for partial or complete termination or increase in requirements, and that claims for partial or full termination costs may not be submitted and will not be paid.
	(b)  A-76.  Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, establishes federal policy regarding the performance of commercial activities (CA). Congress wrote CA policy into law as 10 USC 2461. CAs are functions that provide products or services available from private sources. The CA program emphasizes competition of CAs with the private sector to determine the most efficient and cost-effective means of providing required services.
	(c) BRAC 2005.  The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act (BRAC) of 1990, as amended by Fiscal Year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act, authorized a round of base realignment and closure in 2005.  
(d) Increased or Decreased Requirements.  As a result of consolidating or reorganizing contracting activities at Marine Corps installations or with other Department of the Defense organizations, increased or decreased requirements may result.  Other Department of the Defense bases may also be added.  Additional requirements will require bilateral agreement to be binding.
(e)  The Government reserves the right to terminate the contract for its convenience at no cost and to enter into a different type of agreement if the Government later determines such an alternative type of agreement is more appropriate.  
11.  WHENEVER a contracted entry access/vetting company receives names and personally-identifying information on individuals fitting the following descriptions (e.g. RP, Linguist, Cultural Advisor), they will provide a copy of that information to NCIS for additional vetting through their offices.

ADHC will be furnished to beneficiaries for whom such care is specifically authorized by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  It is understood that the type of patient to be cared for under this Basic Ordering Agreement will receive these services as a substitute for institutionalization. The purposes of providing ADHC are to enable functionally impaired individuals to reside in supportive home environments rather than in nursing home facilities, to facilitate older veterans to their home and coordinate long term care thereby reducing readmission's to hospitals and nursing homes; to maintain the older veteran at the highest level of functioning possible; to improve the quality of life for the participants among their peers; and to provide support for the family and other care givers of older veterans. The care provided will include: medical services (i.e. medication review, treatment planning, and consultative support when necessary) nursing, social work services, assistance with activities of daily living, activity therapy, case management, nutrition service including meals and transportation. 2.	The ADHC Program will meet the VA standards for ADHC as promulgated in 38 CFR Part 17.51c through 17.51e.3.	Unless specifically excluded in this Indefinite Quantity Contract, the per diem rate established will include the services listed above and will also include all services or supplies normally provided other patients by the facility without extra charge.4.	If the VA Medical Center and the ADHC Program agree that the VA shall provide services under 38 CFR 17.51f, the agreement will be incorporated into the contract and either the per diem rate will be re-established or direct payment made to the United States to reflect the full cost of the VA's contribution.5.	Absences of the patient from the ADHC Program will not be reimbursable. Payment will not be provided for services not provided. 6.	It is agreed that the ADHC program will notify the authorizing VA hospital immediately when a medical emergency requiring hospitalization occurs. It is agreed that the veteran will be admitted to an appropriate VA facility. When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-Federal hospital may be accompanied provided VA authorization is obtained. If hospitalization of a non-emergency nature is required, it is agreed that admission to the VA hospital will be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.7.	In the event a VA beneficiary receiving ADHC care under this Indefinite Quantity Contract expire, the ADHC will promptly notify the VA office authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard any of the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by VA patients upon the premises of the ADHC shall be delivered by the ADHC to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the ADHC for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs or next of kin capable of inheriting.  When disposition has been made, the itemized inventory with a notation as to the disposition of the funds and effects will be immediately forwarded to the VA office authorizing admission.  Should a deceased patient have no will, heirs, or next of kin, his/her personal property and funds wherever located vests in and becomes the property of the United States in trust? In these cases the ADHC will forward inventory of any such property and funds in its possession to the VA office authorizing admission, and will hold them (except articles of clothing necessary for proper burial) under safeguard until instructions are received from VA concerning disposition.8.	The ADHC Program shall not maintain nor provide dual or segregated patient facilities which are segregated on the basis of race, creed, color or national origin. The ADHC Program shall neither require such segregated use by written or oral policies nor tolerate such use by local custom. The term "facilities" shall include but not be limited to rooms, wards, sections, eating areas, drinking fountains, and entrances, and other like areas.  9.	It is agreed that VA will have the right to inspection of the ADHC and all appurtenances by authorized VA representative(s) to ensure that acceptable standards are maintained and that the necessary care to maintain the well being of the patient is rendered.10.	The ADHC shall accept referral of and shall provide all services specified in this Indefinite Quantity Contract for any person determined eligible by the VA Medical Director or his/her designee, regardless of the race, color, religion, sex or national origin of the person for whom such services are ordered. In addition, the ADHC Program warrants that subcontracting will not be resorted to as a means of circumventing this provision.11.	It is agreed that duty authorized representatives of VA will provide follow-up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to determine whether acceptable standards are maintained and that adequate care is being rendered.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute for nor relieve the ADHC in any way of the responsibility for the ADHC plan of care and medical treatment of the veteran.12.	All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the ADHC will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the ADHC for a period of at least three years following termination of care.  Patient records will be maintained in conformance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  A medical record shall be maintained for each patient.13.	The beneficiary will be provided ADHC at the expense of VA for a period not in excess of that stated in the Authorization received from VA, unless an extension of the authorization is provided in writing by the placing VA facility.14.	It is agreed that the ADHC Program will submit a monthly report on the attendance, medical, functional and psychosocial status of beneficiaries receiving care under the Indefinite Quantity Contract to the VA.15.	Payments made by the Department of Veteran Affairs under this contract will constitute the total cost of ADHC. The ADHC programs agrees that no additional charges will be billed to the beneficiary or his/her family, either by the ADHC or any third party furnishing services or supplies required or such care, unless specific prior authorization in writing is obtained from the VA facility that authorized payment placement.16.	The ADHC program warrants that all applicable fire laws are being complied with and there are no recommendations of fire officials which have not been resolved.

<DESC>The OWL radar provides the ability to detect, track and locate mortar, cannon and rocket firing positions automatically, when fired in a variety of situations.  This includes conventional indirect weapon fires, in addition to, weapons fired with non-standard trajectories.  The system also has the ability to provide the location of weapons fired in mountainous terrain from elevations both above and below the radar.  The OWL provides high-quality track data on mortar, cannon, and rocket targets in order to be fully capable of providing a cue for handoff to fire control systems.  Additionally, the system provides quality impact point prediction with sufficient warning to improve force protection and take responsive measures in a timely manner.  The system also incorporates advanced techniques for system self-protection against Electronic Attack, i.e., jamming and deception.

PURPOSE.<BR><BR>This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) provides a systematic method to evaluate performance for the stated contract.  This QASP explains the following:<BR>"	What will be monitored.<BR>"	How monitoring will take place.<BR>"	Who will conduct the monitoring.<BR>"	How monitoring efforts and results will be documented.<BR><BR>This QASP does not detail how the contractor accomplishes the work.  Rather, the QASP is created with the premise that the contractor is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  It is the Governments responsibility to be objective, fair, and consistent in evaluating performance.  In addition, the QASP should recognize that unforeseen and uncontrollable situations may occur. <BR><BR>This QASP is a living document and the Government may review and revise it on a regular basis.  However, the Government shall coordinate changes with the contractor.  Updates shall ensure that the QASP remains a valid, useful, and enforceable document.  Copies of the original QASP and revisions shall be provided to the contractor and Government officials implementing surveillance activities.<BR><BR><BR>2. GOVERNMENT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.<BR><BR>The following personnel shall oversee and coordinate surveillance activities.  <BR><BR>a. Contracting Officer (KO) - The KO shall ensure performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensure compliance with the contract terms, and shall safeguard the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship.  The KO shall also assure that the contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under this contract. The KO is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the contractors performance.<BR><BR>b. Contracting Officers Representative (COR) - The COR is responsible for technical administration of the contract and shall assure proper Government surveillance of the contractors performance. The COR shall keep a quality assurance file.  At the conclusion of the contract or when requested by the KO, the COR shall provide documentation to the KO.  The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Governments behalf.  The contractor shall refer any changes they deem may affect contract price, terms, or conditions to the KO for action.<BR><BR>c. Other Key Government Personnel - None<BR><BR><BR>3. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.<BR><BR>Performance standards define desired services.  The Government performs surveillance to determine if the contractor exceeds, meets or does not meet these standards.  <BR><BR>The Performance Requirements Summary Matrix, paragraph 4 in the Performance Work Statement  includes performance standards.  The Government shall use these standards to determine contractor performance and shall compare contractor performance to the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL). <BR><BR>Critical Task	Standard 	Metric	Surveillance Method	Incentives/De-Incentives<BR>1. The contractor shall repair all vehicles and bring them up to the manufacturers recommended operating standards. Para 4	The contractor will repair all vehicles and bring them up to the manufacturers recommended operating standards. Para 4	100% of the time.	Customer Complaints.<BR>	(1) Require Re-performance of the service if applicable. <BR>(2) Contract Deficiency Report (CDR)<BR>2. The contractor shall maintain all vehicles according to the manufacturers recommended operating standards. Para 5	The contractor will perform all repairs to keep the vehicles running.	100% of the time.	Customer Complaints.<BR>	(1) Require Re-performance of the service if applicable. <BR>(2) Contract Deficiency Report (CDR)<BR>3.  The contractor shall perform preventative maintenance to all vehicles in accordance with the manufacturers recommended operating standards. Para 6	The contractor will perform preventative maintenance to all vehicles in accordance with the manufacturers recommended operating standards. 	100% of the time.	Customer Complaints.<BR>	(1) Require Re-performance of the service if applicable. <BR>(2) Contract Deficiency Report (CDR)<BR><BR><BR>4. METHODS OF QA SURVEILLANCE. <BR><BR>Various methods exist to monitor performance.  The COR shall use the surveillance methods listed below in the administration of this QASP. <BR><BR>Regardless of the surveillance method, the COR shall always contact the contractor's task manager or on-site representative when a defect is identified and inform the manager of the specifics of the problem.  The COR, with assistance from the KO, shall be responsible for monitoring the contractors performance in meeting a specific performance standard/AQL.<BR><BR>a. VALIDATED USER/CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS.  (Relies on the user of the service to identify deficiencies.  Complaints are then investigated and validated.  Highly applicable to services provided in quantity and where quality is highly subjective.) <BR><BR>Surveillance results may be used as the basis for actions (to include payment deductions) against the contractor.  In such cases, the Inspection of Services clause in the Contract becomes the basis for the KOs actions.<BR><BR>5. DOCUMENTING PERFORMANCE.<BR><BR>a.  ACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE.<BR><BR>The Government shall document positive performance.  A report template is attached.  Any report may become a part of the supporting documentation for fixed fee payments, award fee payments, or other actions. <BR><BR>b.  UNACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE.<BR><BR>When unacceptable performance occurs, the COR shall inform the contractor.  This will normally be in writing unless circumstances necessitate verbal communication.  In any case the COR shall document the discussion and place it in the COR file.  <BR><BR>When the COR determines formal written communication is required, the COR shall prepare a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR), and present it to the contractor's task manager or on-site representative.  A CDR template is attached to this QASP.  <BR><BR>The contractor shall acknowledge receipt of the CDR in writing.  The CDR will specify if the contractor is required to prepare a corrective action plan to document how the contractor shall correct the unacceptable performance and avoid a recurrence.  The CDR will also state how long after receipt the contractor has to present this corrective action plan to the COR.  The Government shall review the contractor's corrective action plan to determine acceptability. <BR><BR>Any CDRs may become a part of the supporting documentation for contract payment deductions, fixed fee deductions, award fee nonpayment, or other actions deemed necessary by the KO. <BR><BR><BR>6. FREQUENCY OF MEASUREMENT.<BR><BR>While the contractor is fully expected to comply with all requirements in the PWS, the governments assessment of contractor performance will focus mainly on the objectives listed in the AQL column of the Performance Standards Summary Matrix.  The COR will monitor the contractors performance to ensure it meets the standards of the contract.  Unacceptable performance may result in the Contracting Officer taking any of the following actions:  Require the contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements, reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services, issue a Contract Discrepancy Report, or require the contractor to reperform the service.  In addition, the contractors performance will be recorded annually in the Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR).<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>_____________________________<BR>Signature  Contracting Officers Representative<BR><BR><BR><BR>_____________________________<BR>Signature  Contracting Officer<BR><BR> <BR>CONTRACT DISCREPANCY REPORT (CDR)<BR><BR><BR>1.

THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The Small Business size standard is based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 115112, Soil Preparation, Planting, and Cultivating, which is $7.0 million average annual income.  

SUMMARY:  The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, Texas, is seeking a Contractor to furnish all labor, equipment, materials, and incidentals required for tree planting and herbaceous weed control of approximately 433 acres consisting of five (5) sites for the NRCS Texas Wetland Reserve Program (WRP).   All work shall be done in accordance with the Statement of Work Forest Stand Improvement Texas – Bryan Zone, the tree/shrub establishment Statement of Work, the Tree Planting Plan, and the Herbaceous Weed Control for Hardwood Seedlings Bryan Zone Job Sheet – 490B.  

BACKGROUND:  Restoration projects on these five (5) sites include the planting of hardwood seedlings and herbaceous weed control.  
 
SCOPE OF WORK:   
1.  Pre-Planting Conference:  A pre-planting conference will be held between the contractor, owner (or his agent) and the NRCS to discuss planting operation.  Planting and Herbaceous Weed Treatment will not begin before this the Pre-Planting Conference. 
	
2.  Tree Planting: Hardwood seedlings will be machine planted on a 10’ X 10’ spacing (436 trees per acre) on approximately 433 acres.  The planting for the area, except for strips around water impoundments, will consist of one mix described in the Tree Planting Plan attachment to this solicitation. 

3.  Species:  Refer to the attached Tree Planting Specifications.  The contractor is responsible for the ordering of the seedlings, their delivery to the site, their care, and, if necessary, cold storage.  The species for 	most of the site are grouped as preferred and secondary.  At least four species will be planted.  Each referred species will make up no more than 30% of the total mix, and secondary species will make up no more than 10% of the mix.  In addition, a separate mix will be used for the strips planted around impoundments.  In these strips at least two species from the list in the Tree Planting Specification will be 	used. 	
	
4.  Species Substitution:  If a substitution is necessary due to the unavailability of a species from the nursery, low counts in the bags, modifications of the planting plan due to unforeseen conditions, etc., a species will be selected that has an equal or greater tolerance to wetness than the originally selected one.  Contractor must acquire approval from the NRCS for any species substitution.  
	
5.  Spacing and Planting Rate:  Hardwood will be planted on a 10’ X 10’ spacing (436 seedlings per acre). The number of satisfactory planted seedlings must fall within 15% of this planting rate or 370 seedlings per acre.   Areas along the shores of impoundments and natural slough and wet depressions will be planted with the proper species and to the extend that the water depth will allow.  In these areas, spacing will be increase to 15’ X 15’.  

6.  Species Mixes:  Mixes will be achieved through “bag-mixes” and/or matching the species to the site.  Unless otherwise specified in the Tree Planting Plan, row or block plantings of single mixes will be avoided.  Further explanation will be provided at the Pre-Planting Conference. 

7. Seedling Quality:  Seedlings will meet the standards listed in the Tree Planting Specifications.  Both the 	contractor and the NRCS will determine quality and count by opening one bag of each species being planted.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to discuss seedling quality with the NRCS representative to determine the responsibility to “cull” seedlings according to the standards stated in the Tree Planting Specifications.

8.  Seedling Care:  It is the responsibility of the contractor to assure proper care of the seedlings during the planting operation.  Planting will begin immediately after receiving the seedlings.   It is the responsibility of the contractor to secure cold storage.  Contractor must ensure that only then number of seedlings that can be planted in a day will be taken to the site and will be kept shaded and moist at all times.  

9.  Pruning:  

a.  Roots:  The tap roots may be pruned to a minimum length of 8”.  Lateral roots may be pruned to facilitate planting.  Prune by pulling the laterals down along the tap root or cut to its (the tap’s root’s) length.  Pruning will done only with shears or a sharp knife.  All care must be taken to prevent tearing of roots. 

b.  Tops: Tops may be pruned to a minimum height of 16”. 

10.  Planting Methods:  Seedlings will be machine planted.  Seedlings will be planted with the root collar slightly below the soil surface.  Roost will be not be balled, twisted or planted in a “J” or “U” shaped manner.  Steps needed to ensure the compacting of the soil around the seedling, leaving no air pockets in the planting slit, will be taken.  When optimum site and soil moisture and/or temperature conditions are not available, consult with the NRCS before planting. 

11.  Quality Control:  The Control will be ultimately responsible for quality assurance.  Quality control will be explained during the Pre-Planting Conference.  In addition, NRCS representatives will be available during the first day of planting and will occasionally visit the site during planting.  They will also be available for consultation, but they will not serve as daily inspectors.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide daty-to-day oversight of the planting crews.  NRCS will conduct an inspection at the completion of the planting to determine the acceptability of the planting.   

12.  Herbaceous Weed Control:  Contractor will consult with the NRCS to ensure the proper herbicide is used.  Contractor will acquire approval from the NRCS, beforehand to identify the proper application methods for applying herbicide.  
 
13.  Environmental Concerns:  herbicides should not be applied within any Streamside Management Zone or any open water.  Some herbicide application rates are tied to soil texture and moisture.  Most have restrictions concerning applying on or near water.  Again, follow the label instructions as well as the Texas Best Management Practice (BMPs). 

AWARD:  The Government will award a firm-fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government.  The anticipated award date is on or before February 19, 2010.  

TIME FRAMES/DATE.  The Tree planting must be completed by March 31, 2010 (the latest April 15th, depending on conditions) and herbaceous weed treatment will begin May 1, 2010 and completed by June 30, 2010 after contract award.

<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE<br />FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category.</p>
<p><br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the<br />Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL)<br />Web site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<br />is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be<br />initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such<br />unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or<br />fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract.<br />{See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a<br />contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<br />which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for<br />each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed<br />wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of<br />the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no<br />authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be<br />submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted<br />class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<br />Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of<br />Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond<br />paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<br />determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or<br />subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions 4:<br /></span></strong>1) Who provides the DVD/VCR and audio amplifier for Room 236? If provided by the contractor, what are the desired specifications on the amplifier?
<p>2) For all rooms requiring LCD monitors, what type of mounts are to be used? Flat, tilt, or articulating?</p>
<p>3) In Room 236, does the matrix switcher need to have to ability to bring in all computer feeds (approximately 8) as well as the CCTV feed and the CATV feed, and then disburse them to the desired LCD using only one input on each of the LCD monitors? If not, then is it desired to have the monitors have a CCTV and CATV feed at each LCD and the matrix be used as an input only for the PC's and then output to a third input on each of the LCD's? If the matrix is to control all functions, then CATV and CCTV feeds will not be necessary at each LCD, only the feed from the Credenza mounted matrix. The simplest way to ask this question may be this, is it expected that the matrix switcher and touch screen system will handle all incoming source feeds and disburse them with a single feed to each LCD monitor, or is it expected that the touch screen control will handle input switching on each of the LCD's for CCTV and CATV and the matrix will handle PC switching?</p>
<p>4) What will the source(s) be for the projector in Room 236? Will this unit be a fifth source off of the CCTV, CATV, PC touch screen matrix setup?</p>
<p>5) Is there a required finish material for the credenza in Room 236?</p>
<p>6) Can the monitors can vary in size at all. i.e. can they be larger since most manufacturers sizes vary slightly?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Answers 4:</span></strong><br />1) The contractor is responsible for all A/V equipment and sizing it appropriately for each room. We would expect the amp to provide distortion free audio out to the speakers in that room; when, the volume is set to a level that can be clearly understood.</p>
<p>2) All will require tilt and maybe a couple will require articulating.</p>
<p>3) It is expected that the matrix switcher and touch screen system will handle all incoming source feeds and disburse them with a single feed to each LCD monitor.</p>
<p>4) The projector should be considered as an output from the switcher.</p>
<p>5) It will be required to have an aesthetically pleasing finish to complement the other furniture in the room, probably a Cherry finish.</p>
<p>6) The monitors can be larger, but no smaller. However, quotations will be evaluated based on the minimum requirements set forth in the statement of work (i.e. the costs of larger monitor will affect your total price).</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>The estimated contract value is $10M. The guaranteed contract minimum will be $25,000. Traditionally, there have been upwards of 100 active SABER delivery orders at varying stages of completion at any given time.

The period of performance 365 days. This is a follow-on effort to the current contract, FA8601-07-D-0008. Required contractor expertise includes a Contract Manager, Environmental Manager, Design Manager, Quality Assurance Evaluator, and Project Manager. The Government anticipates significant subcontracting activity under the SABER contract and partnering is encouraged.

Dodge Division in Dayton, OH.<br />(5) A registration page will be attached to the website. You are not required to register. However, when you register you will receive notice of any amendments and/or addendums that may be issued to the solicitation.

When the contract is awarded, the contractor shall be responsible for securing performance and payment bonds in the amount of 100% of the cumulative dollar value of all active delivery orders.

<DESC>The OWL radar provides the ability to detect, track and locate mortar, cannon and rocket firing positions automatically, when fired in a variety of situations. This includes conventional indirect weapon fires, in addition to, weapons fired with non-standard trajectories. The system also has the ability to provide the location of weapons fired in mountainous terrain from elevations both above and below the radar. The OWL provides high-quality track data on mortar, cannon, and rocket targets in order to be fully capable of providing a cue for handoff to fire control systems. Additionally, the system provides quality impact point prediction with sufficient warning to improve force protection and take responsive measures in a timely manner. The system also incorporates advanced techniques for system self-protection against Electronic Attack, i.e., jamming and deception.

<DESC><p>1. The Project: NOAA has a requirement for Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) hydrographic surveying services to support nautical charting and related products for the coastal and adjacent ocean areas of the United States (including possessions and territories), the Great Lakes and other inland navigable waters. One or more three-year indefinite delivery contract, not to exceed $5 million per year, is scheduled for award in Fiscal Year 2010. Work orders under this contract will consist of, but are not limited to: 1) acquiring shallow water airborne hydrographic LIDAR sounding data; 2) acquiring shoreline and coastal topographic LIDAR; 3) installing, operating, and removing water level (tide) stations; 4) acquiring related supporting data (e.g. water level correctors, secchi depth readings, etc.); 5) processing the data, including tidal tabulation, computation of tidal datums, tidal zoning determination, applying water level correctors to determine the true depths, and compiling reports and digital data; 6) performing quality control during data acquisition and processing; and 7) delivery of the data and reports to NOAA for application to the nautical charts and associated hydrographic products. All work shall be performed to NOAA hydrographic survey specifications and the data provided in NOAA specified formats. See http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/docs/Specs2009 for typical technical specifications and a description of the deliverables. The final statement of work provided by NOAA will tailor these specifications for each work order issued. A quality control plan will be a contract requirement. Potential vendors are encouraged to review the technical specifications and a description of the deliverables before responding to this announcement. This contract will permit a Government Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) or government appointed observer to be present during aircraft operations.</p>
<p>Note that topographic LIDAR is expected to be a minor portion of any work awarded under this contract, and only conducted incidental to a hydrographic LIDAR project. Any stand-alone shoreline mapping or topographic LIDAR work will be tasked through existing NOAA National Geodetic Survey contracts and performed to National Geodetic Survey Coastal Mapping Program specifications.</p>
<p>2. Selection Criteria: Firms must provide sufficient surveying equipment and sufficient technical, supervisory, and administrative personnel to ensure timely execution of work assignments. Participation by firms qualifying as small, small disadvantaged, and/or women-owned small businesses will be one of the factors of consideration in the selection process. To be considered for selection, a firm must demonstrate surveying experience in the types of surveys stated above and have on its payroll at least two hydrographers and a tides/water level specialist. The two hydrographers must each have a minimum of three years experience in surveying using shallow water airborne hydrographic LIDAR systems and interpreting the data. The tides/water level specialist must have demonstrated experience in measurement of tides and water levels, tidal datums, and tidal zoning and their application to hydrographic surveying. A firm must show the availability of the following: suitable aircraft that complies with applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and other applicable state and federal regulations, hydrographic data acquisition and processing systems, a shallow water airborne hydrographic LIDAR system capable of detecting submerged contacts measuring 2m x 2m x 1m and capable of measuring water depths to 50 meters, GPS surveying equipment for establishing horizontal control, differential GPS equipment for aircraft positioning, water level measurement gauges, and a topographic LIDAR system.</p>
<p>Evaluation criteria, in order of importance, are: (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time (personnel and equipment); (4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules; (5) Location and knowledge: capability to work in diverse types of localities in the U.S., especially in Alaska; and (6) Proposed plans to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities on this project to small, small-disadvantaged, and/or women-owned small business concerns. Evaluation criteria (6) will not apply to small business firms because subcontracting plans are not required from those concerns pursuant to FAR 19.702(b).</p>
<p>Responding firms are requested to state whether they are a small, small disadvantaged business, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small business. Responding firms are encouraged to use small business concerns in the execution of this project. Large business firms should demonstrate their commitment and discuss proposed plans to provide subcontracting opportunities to the small business community in the performance of this project.</p>
<p>Specific professionals required on this contract include, but are not limited to: Project Manager, Hydrographer experienced with LIDAR systems, Tides/Water Level Specialist, Land Surveyor, and GIS Specialist (Geographers/Cartographer/Geospatial Data Analyst). Firms should indicate their experience using a shallow water airborne hydrographic LIDAR system and provide an outline of how the Prime contractor will manage their team to ensure that quality products are delivered to NOAA. For evaluation factor (3) Capacity, a list of key personnel demonstrating their availability for the project, considering other commitments and major equipment available for project assignment, must be provided along with other pertinent information. The operating specifications of the shallow water airborne hydrographic LIDAR system and the topographic LIDAR system must be included.</p>
<p>3. Submission: All responsible sources may submit a response for consideration by NOAA. Prime contractors shall respond to this announcement for their teams. The prime contractor shall submit an original plus three copies of its team's response to this synopsis. The response shall consist of Standard Form 330 (SF330) and other material not to exceed 100 pages in total. Each original and copy shall be bound (e.g. 3-ring binder, GBC comb binding, etc.). Facsimile responses are not authorized.</p>
<p>Carefully read and follow the instructions printed on SF330. Present the team's qualifications for this project in Part I. Submit a separate Part II for each firm that will be part of the team proposed for this contract. Use Part I, Section H, Block 30 to address: Capacity, Knowledge of the proposed project areas, and if not a small business, plans to use small business concerns in a meaningful role.</p>
<p>Responses (SF330's) are due to the following address no later than 1:00 pm EST, February 1, 2010: U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA/NCAD, Attn: Catherine Perren, 1305 East-West Hwy., SSMC4 Station 7608, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3282.</p>

There must be more than two awards to create a Historically Under-Utilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), 8(a) Small Disadvantaged (SDB) or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless not set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be award.  <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the Product Delivery Team will consider 10 the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.<BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the four contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until: 1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that one or more of the task orders under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.  <BR><BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two-Phase Design Build Process.

The scope of these SWD MATOCs include construction under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, it is expected that additional work (excluding individual dredging projects), including but not limited to the following types of projects:  abutment, asphalt and concrete paving, bridge, culverts, curbs, and street gutters, elevated highway construction, overpass, road and street surfacing, trestle, water and sewer, mains pumping stations, treatment plants and storage tanks, anchored earth retention, breakwater, spillway, floodwater, bulkhead wall or embankment, channel canal, dams, related projects, repair, maintain, and build marine related structures, levees, flood control and jetties, anti-terrorism and force protection, outdoor recreation facilities, park and recreational open space improvement and other construction activities as appropriate under NAICS code 237 will be executed under the resultant MATOC contracts.  <BR><BR>This requirement is part of the total MATOC program requirements for Horizontal Construction in the Southwestern Division (SWD) of approximately $950M all contracts combined to provide capacity to support the execution of SWD's horizontal construction, workload missions, including horizontal construction missions associated with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) signed into law on February 20, 2009.  There must be more than two awards to create a Historically Under-Utilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), 8(a) Small Disadvantaged (SDB) or unrestricted to establish a pool of two or more each, the remaining contract capacity of the pool not established will be distributed by 1) equally distributing the total contract capacity to the remaining pools unless no set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point the total capacity will be redistributed to the unrestricted pool, and/or 2) making additional competitive awards to the remaining set-aside pools unless not set-aside pools can be established due to lack of competition at which point additional unrestricted contracts will be award.  <BR><BR>In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the Product Delivery Team will consider 10 the complexity of the work, 2) contract task order limitation, 3) on-going work, 4) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.<BR><BR>Each task order will be awarded pursuant to FAR 16.505, and in accordance with the provisions contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The task order terms and conditions including the scope of work will be the same for the unrestricted, 8(a), HUBZone and SDVOSB contractors.  However, the maximum contract capacity, task order limitations, contract minimum guarantee and bonding capacity will differ between the four contractor pools.  All contracts will remain active unless or until: 1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that one or more of the task orders under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.  <BR><BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two-Phase Design Build Process.  The first phase consists of a process known in the commercial design-build industry as the Request for Qualifications or acronym:  RFQ.  (This solicitations refers to it as Phase1.)
