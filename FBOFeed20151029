<DESC>Note:  The USAF intends to award a sole source contract under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source) to Battelle Memorial Institute, as it is the only known source for repair and upgrade of the UDTU (Upgraded Data Transfer Unit) to RDTU (Redesigned Data Transfer Unit).  The upgrade and repair includes the insertion of redesigned circuit cards, which replace obsolescent parts in the UDTU. Other sources may inquire about qualification, but are advise that the path to qualification is estimated to be approximately two years.  Interested parties would need to develop necessary test equipment, and demonstrate repair and production capability.

<DESC>DLA Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to add 34 national stock numbers (NSNs) on the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (97499) corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, a long-term sole source contract which includes multiple NSNs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (BHTI) (97499) Legacy corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, in accordance with the initially approved J&amp;A; however, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort. The pricing for the national stock numbers will be for option Years 4 and 5 of the contract. The contract expiration date is 22 February 2017. The contract requires a supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB origin and inspection/acceptance at origin to DLA Direct stock locations. A total of 34 NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. It is anticipated that the total 34 NSNs will be priced for the award. The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., CAGE 97499.<br /><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites must provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by Wednesday, November 11, 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (<a href="mailto:anne.mastrincola@dla.mil">anne.mastrincola@dla.mil</a>).<br /><br />Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached 34 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. The Letter RFP issue date is Friday, November 13, 2015. The anticipated closing date is Monday, December 14, 2015.<br /><br />DLA Aviation

The ECAT System allows DLA Troop Support (CONUS AND OCONUS) customers to review and compare contractor electronic catalogs with the ultimate goal of placing on-line orders to the contractor of their choice.</span></strong></p>
<p>DLA Troop Support military and other government customers are currently using the ECAT System to order medically related laboratory, dental and optical supplies and limited medical equipment.</p>
<p>This is the follow-on to our current standing solicitation number SPM2D1-07-R-0012 which closed on August 12, 2011. The objective of this solicitation is to award the next generation of ECAT contracts for Medical Equipment. This acquisition seeks to award multiple contracts to all "responsive", responsible offerors (both manufacturers and dealers). The solicitation requests contractors to provide their discounted price(s) from their commercial catalog(s) of various medical equipment items for ECAT. This solicitation will result in multiple long term contracts with a base term of 5 years. This solicitation will be standing for 5 years from the solicitation issuance date.</p>
<p>This acquisition seeks to award multiple IDIQ contracts. DLA Troop Support awards will be in accordance with the ECAT multi-award program complying with requirements of FAR 8.4, DFARS 208.405-70 and DLAD 8.4 to technically acceptable, responsible vendors (both manufacturers and dealers) offering Medical Equipment items at fair and reasonable prices. The solicitation requires contractors to offer their commercial products that complied with the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Medical Equipment is defined as that equipment used by medical professionals, technicians and laboratory personnel to perform a treatment, test or operation. We are soliciting for medical equipment, maintenance of medical equipment (with or without the equipment), and/or spare parts/repair parts of medical equipment (with or without the equipment). Along with these items, the following may be required: classroom training, repair parts, maintenance of the item(s) and installation when applicable, all consumable and non-consumable items used in conjunction with any and all medical equipment. Typically, but not always, the operation of medical equipment requires line power (120 or 220 VAC, 50 or 60 Hz), with some having back-up batteries. Some equipment relies solely on battery power.</p>
<p>We are soliciting for Contractors' entire medical equipment product lines. The medical equipment includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1. Defibrillators<br />2. Pulse oximeters<br />3. Aspirators<br />4. Ventilators<br />5. Examination tables/surgical tables<br />6. Repair parts <br />7. Dental systems/handpieces<br />8. Infusions pumps <br />9. Suction apparatus <br />10. Resuscitators<br />11. Patient monitors<br />12. Electrocardiographs<br />13. Analyzers/test equipment<br />14. Anesthesia apparatus<br />15. Medical furniture<br />16. Hospital beds/chairs/stretchers<br />17. Laboratory analyzers<br />18. Small portable ultrasound(s)<br />19. Litters<br />20. Lasers<br />21. Dental X-Rays<br />22. Sterilizers<br />23. Medical Refrigerators<br />24. Ophthalmic Equipment</p>
<p>Under this solicitation the following items are excluded: Ultrasounds (other than small portable), Diagnostic X-Ray (other than small portable and Dental X-Ray), Magnetic Resonance Imaging Systems, Nuclear Medicine, Computed Tomography, Magnetoencephalography, Pet Scanner, Cyclotron, Radiation Oncology , Lithotripsy and PACs.<br /><br />NOTE TO CONTRACTORS WITH EXISTING CONTRACTS UNDER SPM2D1-07-R-0012:</p>
<p>In an effort to avoid a gap in contract coverage, current contractors should in general submit a "new offer" as early as 9 months prior to the expiration of their existing contract. The government has the right to award a "new offer" contract before, at time of expiration, or after the expiration of the contractor's existing contract.</p>
<p>The standing solicitation will be available via download from the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/ on or before August 16, 2011</p>

<DESC>The National Park Service, Alaska Regional Office, intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price commercial item purchase order to Alcan Electrical & Engineering, Inc.  (DUNS #053820593) for the upgrading of its Regional Office building security system. These upgrades include the S2 Enterprise Security Management System, Enterprise class controller and 6 network nodes to replace the existing access control system, a 3-year software upgrade and support plan, and 4 hours of user training.  Alcan will also replace the existing 47 AWID readers and keypads with new PIV class HID Multiclass SE readers and keypads. All work will be performed between November 23 and January 30, 2016. 
 
Alcan Electric is the only authorized electrical company permitted to access the NPS building electrical system and make alterations, per JL Properties. Alcan Electric has been awarded prior contracts for the purchase of various video and building access systems and solutions. They are familiar with existing infrastructure, understand how our systems interconnect, and have undergone extensive background checks to be permitted access to sensitive information. Finally, the existing system is considered proprietary to Alcan Electric, as they maintain the configuration schematics that keep the NPS building a secure federal facility. 

The estimated magnitude of this project is between $25,000 and $100,000. 

This is not a request for competitive proposals, bids, or quotes. The Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available.

<ARCHDATE>11242015
<CONTACT>Shaan A. Charran 407-380-8125

<a href="mailto:Shaan.Charran@navy.mil">Shaan.Charran@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, is seeking potential sources with the ability to provide Contractor Instruction Services (CIS) for Navigation, Seamanship and Shiphandling (NSS) training located at multiple sites worldwide.  

It is anticipated that a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract will be awarded. The Period of Performance (POP) of this contract is 60 months, inclusive of one (1) base year and four (4) 12-month options. Start of contractor performance will be 15 June 2016 inclusive of 60 days mobilization period.

NSS training sites are located in US Navy Fleet Concentration Areas and include high fidelity shiphandling simulators.
 The anticipated services to be provided are delivery of Contractor Instructor training using standard industry equipment as well as the scheduling and coordination of training events through the administration of a web-based scheduling tool to provide accessibility to ships at sea. 
There are ten (10) sites that will require training on an on-call basis in response to the operational schedule of the fleet. Six (6) of the sites are in the Continental U.S. (CONUS) while four (4) of the sites are Outside the Continental U.S. (OCONUS). The six CONUS sites are Mayport, FL, Norfolk, VA, San Diego, CA, Everett, WA, Pearl Harbor, HI, and Newport, RI. The four OCONUS sites are Sasebo, Japan, Yokosuka, Japan, Manama, Bahrain, and Rota, Spain.

Examples of the types of instruction to be provided are Bridge Resource Management (BRM) and Basic Ship-Handling (BSH), Surface Command Assessment, Navigation and Ship-handling Special Evolutions and various other Navigation and Ship-handling bridge watch-stander scenarios.
  

Based on a preliminary risk assessment conducted by NAWCTSD, this task is expected to be competed under the unrestricted LOT of FTSS III.  The risk assessment took into account the complexity of managing this dynamic training requirement to include OCONUS sites and the associated requirement for continuous connectivity to the operational fleet. Overseas contracts have inherent risks which may include but are not limited to unique tax implications and a lack of fully defined issues affecting these types of contracts. During the acquisition planning stage for FTSS III, it was determined that small businesses were not suitable for contracts that had overseas components. In addition to this inherent complexity, the requirement for delivery of a web based scheduling tool with fleet connectivity raises the risk to an unacceptable level.

Businesses potentially willing to submit a proposal are invited to provide a capabilities statement which contains, at a minimum, business size and the Lot(s) that they have been awarded contracts under the Fielded Training Support Systems (FTSS III) Multiple Award Contract (MAC).
 NAWCTSD requests any small businesses with a compelling argument as to why their firm should be eligible to propose to this task, submit a capabilities statement inclusive of the following: (1) justification that shows how the inherent risks associated with this requirement can be mitigated to include demonstration of successful Past Performance in a similarly complex environment; (2) contracts with a minimum of two (2) OCONUS sites and four (4) CONUS sites simultaneously, for contractor instructor services; (3) dollar values and site locations; and (4) Point of Contact (POC) for each site to include name, address, phone, email. Summaries should be no longer than five (5) pages in length. 

Information should be sent via e-mail to Shaan.Charran@navy.mil, Responses are requested by 9 November 2015.
 The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, nor for the Government to pay for the information received.  No request for proposal solicitation document exists at this time. Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Shaan A. Charran, via email Shaan.Charran@navy.mil or by telephone at (407)380-8125.

<SOLNBR>AHR165513
<RESPDATE>110615
<CONTACT>Flora Gomes, Contract Specialist , Email flora.gomes@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source:
<p>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS) on behalf of PSC, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) intends to sole source to:</p>
<p>Company.Com LLC <br />590 Minosa Blvd. Ste. 210<br />Roswell, GA 30075-5083</p>
<p>The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has a need to renew its current HyperOffice Enterprise Collaboration Platform subscription, support and maintenance agreement for collaborative workspaces.</p>
<p>AHRQ deployed and implemented the WebEx One online meeting platform starting in 2007. The WebEx One enterprise license model was adopted in 2010 for cost-savings and ease of setting up new collaborative workspaces to support program initiatives and portfolios. It was approved as centralized IT infrastructure, and supported in the cloud, for secure collaborative extranet sites and ease of deployment, with annual renewals for licensing and maintenance. The WebEx One online meeting platform came to end-of-life Nov. 30, 2014, requiring AHRQ to transition all content and collaborative workspaces to a new platform prior to the decommissioning date.</p>
<p>After conducting market research and analysis in 2014 it was determined that the Company.Com product, HyperOffice, was the only service provider who can meet all of the requirements for the migration, implementation, transition and on-going support necessary to allow AHRQ to efficiently and seamlessly continue to provide this collaborative workspace service. A one-year contract for migration and the collaborative workspace platform was awarded to Company.Com, November 2014.</p>
<p>The HyperOffice Enterprise Subscription provides unlimited registered member accounts across unlimited workspace sites and with unlimited storage. The HyperOffice platform supports security certification (SSL encryption), is HIPPA Compliant and encompasses features such as full-text search, supports all file formats, shared calendars and contacts, project and tasks assignments and resident databases. A centralized administrative console is effectively and easily used to manage the workspaces from an enterprise standpoint, to create accounts, and to set permissions.</p>
<p>Due to the recent transition from WebEx One to HyperOffice, switching to a new provider duplicates recently performed transitional work. This can cause critical loss in data, operability issues and delays among users who are already trained in and familiar with the HyperOffice platform. Switching to a new service provider would create a burden to the AHRQ HyperOffice Portal community to switch to another provider.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement addressing their specific abilities regarding this requirement. The email subject line must reference AHR165513. All responses are due by November 6, 2015, 8:00 AM Eastern Time and can be sent to Flora Gomes at flora.gomes@psc.hhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation No:  W912DW-15-R-0005 <br> Central Treatment Plant Upgrade and Groundwater Collection System Project, Bunker Hill, Idaho <br>  <br> Type:  Construction RFP <br> NAICS Code:  237110, Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction <br> FSC Code:  Y1PD <br> Class Code:  Y <br> Size:  $36.5 million <br> Type of Set-A-Side:  Unrestricted <br>  <br>  <br> The Seattle District is soliciting proposals for the Central Treatment Plant Upgrade and Groundwater Collection System Project, Bunker Hill, Idaho.  The Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical Complex Superfund Site (Site) is located primarily in northern Idaho. The Site includes mining-contaminated areas in the Coeur d'Alene River corridor, adjacent floodplains, downstream water bodies, tributaries, and fill areas, as well as in the 21- square-mile Bunker Hill  quote mark Box quote mark  (designated as Operable Unit (OU 2) where historical ore-processing and smelting operations occurred. Records of Decisions issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) include remedial actions for collecting and treating select metals- contaminated source waters within OU 2.  This particular remedial action project includes the following elements: <br>  <br> 1. Upgrade and expansion of the existing Central Treatment Plant (CTP) <br>  <br> 2. An effluent discharge pipeline from the expanded CTP to the South Fork Coeur d'Alene River (SFCDR) <br> 	 <br> 3. A groundwater collection and conveyance system (GWCS) located primarily between the Central Impoundment Area (CIA) and Interstate 90 (I-90) to allow treatment of contaminated groundwater at the expanded CTP or routing to a storage pond <br>  <br> 4. Ongoing treatment of existing acid mine drainage (AMD) flows to current discharge standards during construction <br>  <br> 5. Operations and maintenance services prior to and during construction of the expanded CTP and GWCS, during startup and commissioning, and for a period of between 2 and 5 years following startup (yet to be determined) of the GWCS and the upgraded and expanded CTP. <br>  <br> The upgraded and expanded CTP will treat a combination of existing influent AMD from the Bunker Hill mine and new influent (metals-contaminated groundwater piped to the CTP using a lime precipitation high density sludge (HDS) process). The treatment plant will be upgraded and expanded to treat between 5,000 gallons per minute (gpm) and 8,000 gpm (yet to be determined). Major components of the upgrade include new reactors, thickener modifications, and addition of granular media filters. A new effluent discharge pipeline and outfall into the SFCDR will also be constructed. Updated and more stringent treatment standards are to be met following startup. <br>  <br> The GWCS for the new influent water source is anticipated to consist of a series of groundwater extraction wells located along the northern edge of the CIA, and a new below-grade cutoff wall located down-gradient from the extraction wells. Approximate dimensions of the below grade cutoff wall are anticipated to be 8,000 feet in length and 20-40 feet in depth to interface with the confining layer of the aquifer.   In addition, associated piping to convey the contaminated groundwater either directly to the CTP or to an existing geomembrane-lined storage pond will also be required. The GWCS well field is anticipated to be controlled through a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system that will be constructed as part of this project and integrated with the updated treatment plant control system allowing centralized operation. <br>  <br> To be eligible for contract award a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management.  Register via the SAM Internet site at SAM, https://www.sam.gov. <br>  <br> The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237110 with a size standard of $36.5 million.   This requirement is unrestricted and proposals may be accepted from small and large businesses.  For information concerning NAICS and SBA size standards, go to http://www.sba.gov <br>  <br> Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), the solicitation will be available for download no earlier than 15 days following the posting of this synopsis.  Pursuant to FAR, the response date of the solicitation is no earlier than 30 days from the date of the solicitation release date.  The proposal due date will be noted on the solicitation at the time of issue.  There is no information available until the issue of the solicitation via the Internet.  Register as an interested party at this synopsis site on www.fbo.gov to receive notification of solicitation issue, which will be no sooner than 31 October 2014 <br>  <br> Issue of the solicitation will be in electronic format only.

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for research focusing in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2). Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD SERDP's intent to competitively fund research and development for environmental research that addresses the Statements of Need set forth in the Announcement. SERDP supports environmental research relevant to the management and mission of the DoD and supports efforts that lead to the development and application of innovative environmental technologies or methods that improve the environmental performance of DoD by improving outcomes, managing environmental risks, and/or reducing costs or time required to resolve environmental problems.
<p>The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found on the DoD SERDP website at www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/SERDP-Solicitations/Non-Federal-Core-Proposal-Instructions. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with all instructions on the SERDP website no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 7, 2016. No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.</p>
<p>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. It is the sole responsibility of the submitted to make certain the proposal is properly received by SERDP. Awards will take the form of contracts. Submission of pre-proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals or travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals.</p>
<p>There is no commitment by SERDP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any cost incurred by the offeror before contract award is made. It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $10.0 million will be made dependent on the quality of proposals received and availability of funds.</p>
<p><br />Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit research pre-proposals for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal. Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by SERDP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether SERDP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions located on the SERDP website, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Personnel, and Cost. Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, SERDP will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Evaluation criteria for full proposals will include Transition Plan and Small Business Participation, in addition to the criteria above.</p>
<p>Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value. If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $700,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees. Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $700,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The HECSA Small Business Office web site at http://www.usace.army.mil/ HECSA/HECSASmallBusiness provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE.
<p>The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH is currently in the process of competing the Parts and Repair Ordering System (PROS) V follow-on contract. AFSAC anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide acquisition services for non-standard and difficult to purchase standard items in support of foreign military sales. This tri-service contract will support FMS Air Force, Navy and Army requirements. This requirement would act as a bridge contract from PROS IV to PROS V.</p>
<p>Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor's performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing, quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer. The PROS program goal is to provide "one stop shopping" for the FMS country. The current PROS IV contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), period of performance Jun 12 - Jun 17 (3-year base period with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), firm fixed price and cost reimbursable (task orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and an Objective Performance Incentive (OPI) . <strong>NOTE: The period of performance for this acquisition is limited to a maximum of nine months (August 2016 to June 2017) or through the conclusion of the awarded PROS V transition period, whichever is soonest. Contractor would be required to create and implement a procurement software system capable of interfacing with Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS) within 1 month of award. Ramp up time frame to be fully operational would be limited to 1 month after award.</strong></p>
<p>Historical Environment: Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The 90+ plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure rates. The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate computations make predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for supply action usually due to inability to meet an established need date. However, the managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year. Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being maintenance and task orders.</p>
<p>This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service. The majority of the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service. The successful bidder for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the contract. The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and OPI. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have been completed several years before. The successful bidder shall be advised to make arrangements to address this potential liability. <br />NOTE: The SDR process has been problematic in previous contracts. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass-through costs for procuring required parts and services.</p>
<p>Desirable Features: Competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance; current contract contains a 90% effective competition rate. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings - best available price - minimizing participation fees, turn-around time - shortest possible lead-time - lead-time from after receipt of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time and encourages small business participation. Each company responding should indicate the following: Cage Code, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number, Company Name, Address, Telephone Number (Of POC), Fax Number, Email Address (Of POC). Also, each company should indicate their business size: other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and/or HUBZone in accordance with the stated NAICS code and size standard. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this acquisition is 541614, "Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting", with a size standard of $15M. Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Capabilities Package</strong>. All interested firms should submit capability packages that outline their capability to provide the required purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. Additionally, interested firms should specifically state how they intend to meet the limited 1-month ramp up time frame after contract award and discuss their capability to be fully operational within that time frame. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. <strong>Recent, relevant experience and/or capabilities in all areas should be provided.</strong> Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar work within the past three (3) years. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 10 pages with 12-point font with at least 1" margins . Each page of your package should be printable on 8 &frac12;" x 11" paper. Submit capabilities packages via e-mail to Tammy Tobe; tamara.tobe@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Parts Ordering Repair Service-PROS."

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI/SS or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI/SS.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The US Army Communications Electronics Research &amp; Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) Space &amp; Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&amp;TCD) is interested in leveraging commercial cellular Long Term Evolution (LTE) communications and smart devices to rapidly deploy new capabilities to the Soldier.</p>
<p>CERDEC S&amp;TCD is interested in receiving information from industry on potential methodologies to mitigate the current limitations in commercial cellular technology for fielding in Military settings.</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The US Army Communications Electronics Research &amp; Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) Space &amp; Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&amp;TCD) is interested in receiving information from companies that have experience in the design, development, and implementation of cellular LTE technology. The focus is to adapt commercial cellular/wireless technology to address Military unique requirements such as spectrum agility, susceptibility, security and architecture.</p>
<p><br />SCOPE</p>
<p>The objective of the RFI/SS is for vendors to present and provide their cellular expertise and solutions for developing, designing, integrating, and/or deploying Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, which meet the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardization, for fixed and mobile platforms (i.e., handheld and tablet devices S&amp;TCD Tactical Communications Division (TCD), Commercial Technology Evaluation and Integration (CTEI) Branch, is particularly interested in receiving mitigation techniques that address the following issues:</p>
<p>1. Spectrum <br />Frequency agility is desired for a Military-adapted LTE system. Commercial 4G LTE basestations and End User Devices (EUD) are designed for frequency bands which are allocated for commercial use. There are practical and policy issues for the Army to utilize commercial frequency bands both CONUS and OCONUS. Allocation of frequency bands per device for Military application may be limited in comparison to commercial networks (1.2 MHz versus 10 - 100 MHz), which significantly reduces data rates.</p>
<p>2. Architecture <br />Architecture and infrastructure solutions are desired for an LTE system that is capable of being deployed in various tactical and multi-cast environments in order to provide cellular communications consisting of voice, video, data, MMS, and/or SMS for multiple users in combat operations. Commercial cellular networks rely on fixed infrastructures, which come with high-profile, densely-populated towers, core networks and backhaul facilities which are not easily mobile and can be easily spotted and targeted by adversaries in a tactical environment. Cellular networks also typically extend the range of coverage by erecting high towers and utilizing large amounts of transmission power, which is not feasible for a tactical setting. CERDEC S&amp;TCD is interested in exploring methods to attain infrastructureless cellular communications and provide range extension and seamless mobility between different communication enclaves.</p>
<p>3. Susceptibility <br />Commercial cellular communication technologies are typically located in friendly environment with little to no concern of adversarial operations. CERDEC S&amp;TCD is interested in potential hardening techniques for the technology to be suitable for Military use.</p>
<p>4. Security <br />Since cyber security and privacy awareness are currently on the rise amongst technology users, commercial communication industry continues to develop and integrate robust security solutions and policies for LTE technologies. Despite these efforts to increase cyber security and privacy policies, current implemented commercial security are not sufficient for Military use.<br />CERDEC S&amp;TCD will evaluate the responses received in order to prepare an acquisition strategy for the LTE developmental effort.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this RFI/SS, LTE program development will be a teaming effort between CERDEC S&amp;TCD and industry. Solutions include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />1. End-to-end LTE architecture incorporating eNodeB, EPC, etc.<br />2. Various form factors to include fixed, mobile and man-portable.<br />3. Power consumption in keeping with form factor.<br />4. Enhanced hopping mechanism.<br />5. Enhanced handoff capabilities.<br />6. Scanning capabilities.<br />7. Coordinated comms/jamming.<br />8. CSfC security solution.<br />9. IMSI Protection.<br />10. Range of effective radio frequency communication between system and user devices equal to or greater than 4 kilometers under line of sight conditions.<br />11. Support multiple sectors.<br />12. Support multiple radio heads (eNodeB).<br />13. Support handoffs between in-network neighboring eNodeBs.<br />14. Support handoffs between EPCs (roaming).<br />15. Architecture is scalable. (ex. adding hardware increases range, capacity, etc.)<br />16. Support full motion video of four or more simultaneous end users.<br />17. Support encryption capabilities (ex. IPsec).<br />18. Upgradeable to meet requirements of LTE-Advanced technology.</p>
<p>DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>CERDEC S&amp;TCD request industry to provide Technology along with the following, but not limited to:</p>
<p>General<br />&bull; Statement of interest. <br />&bull; Description of qualification: demonstrated products, projects, and applicable experience. State whether your current experience is in design, development or both. <br />&bull; Description of existing or planned work in this area. Provide information on partnership agreements planned or existing along with past performance.</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<p>CMS is currently administering a payment error rate measurement program in the Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) programs. CMS must estimate payment error rates in Medicaid and CHIP as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002, amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 (IPERIA). The IPERIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities annually, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress. The IPERIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts.</p>
<p>CMS implemented the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) methodology to produce state and national error rates for fee-for-service claims, managed care capitation payments, and eligibility determinations. Currently, federal contractors perform the review of fee-for-service and managed care payments while states conduct their own review of eligibility determinations.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act created significant changes to Medicaid and CHIP eligibility applicable to all states regardless of their decision to expand Medicaid. Accordingly, the current methodologies applied to measurement of eligibility accuracy under PERM need to be updated to reflect the changes states are making to their eligibility policies and systems.</p>
<p>Traditionally, states have been responsible for the PERM eligibility component, which has required states to develop universes of active and negative cases, randomly sample cases, conduct case reviews to determine whether eligibility was determined or re-determined correctly and collect payments associated with sampled cases. Moving forward, CMS anticipates using a federal Eligibility Review Contractor (ERC) to conduct the eligibility reviews for the PERM measurement in all states. Using an ERC will improve the consistency of reviews and reduce the workload for states. Moreover, it will provide CMS with increased oversight of the PERM eligibility component. The ERC will be responsible for:</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinating with CMS, states, and other PERM contractors<br />&bull; Collecting, updating, and maintaining all state and federal policies related to Medicaid and CHIP eligibility;<br />&bull; Obtaining access to state eligibility systems;<br />&bull; Conducting eligibility case reviews; <br />&bull; Reporting findings to the states and resolving any discrepancies between their findings and the states' expectations; and<br />&bull; Supporting states and CMS in the review and development of corrective actions related to PERM findings.</p>
<p>Overview of the Requirements</p>
<p>Interested parties should demonstrate that they possess the experience and/or the ability to provide the full range of services outlined below:</p>
<p>1) Conducting eligibility case reviews for the 17 states in each PERM cycle;<br />2) Collecting, updating, and maintaining state and federal Medicaid and CHIP eligibility policies, which includes conducting research on state eligibility procedures and systems as it pertains to caseworker actions and systems interactions in making eligibility determinations;<br />3) Accessing state eligibility systems, which may require onsite travel; <br />4) Requesting, obtaining, and storing eligibility data from state eligibility systems and case files;<br />5) Conducting eligibility review of sampled eligibility applicants to determine whether the state determined the applicants' eligibility under new ACA requirements; <br />6) Communicating findings to the states and working with the states to resolve any disagreements about the findings; <br />7) Maintaining, enhancing, and hosting a PERM eligibility review website for the purposes of tracking findings and reporting; and<br />8) Serving as a consultant to the PERM program, assisting states/CMS in developing corrective actions, and collaborating with CMS and other contractors to compose cycle summary and PERM final reports.</p>
<p>Capability Statement Information<br />Interested parties should demonstrate that they possess the following capabilities in their capability statements:</p>
<p>&bull; Knowledge of IPERIA requirements and understanding of overall PERM goals;<br />&bull; Strong understanding of national and state Medicaid and CHIP eligibility policy and Affordable Care Act requirements and how such policies impact the eligibility review;<br />&bull; Documented working knowledge of state eligibility systems and determination processes;<br />&bull; Demonstrated experience reviewing Medicaid and CHIP eligibility determinations under new Affordable Care Act requirements; <br />&bull; Resource capacity to conduct case and payment reviews across 17 states in a given cycle within required timeframes, as outlined by CMS; and<br />&bull; Proven experience working with state Medicaid and CHIP agencies</p>

<DESC>Group Dynamics training allows participants to study the ways in which authority is vested in leaders by others, to study the factors involved as they happen, to study the covert processes that operate in and among groups, and to study the problems encountered in the exercise of authority. Participants are provided with experience-based group opportunities to study their own behavior as it happens, and course events allow consultation with contract employees ("Consultants") to facilitate that task. The hallmark of this type of methodology is the attempt to more fully see things as they are in organizational life. The course is designed to help participants explore and identify the causes of organizational distress so that upon returning to their workplaces, they can recognize them more clearly. Participants in this type of training can increase their understanding about the nature and exercise of their own authority as well as that of others, and can therefore be equipped to deal more effectively with the challenges of working in a range of organizations. In particular, participants can be more prepared to make decisions about how to take on the responsibilities of leadership and/or followership.

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to post a Request for Information (RFI) via the internet, and solicit responses from interested parties. Pursuant to FAR 52.215-3, this document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).   <P> Prospective responders are invited to submit their responses no later than 11/13/2015 by 4:00 p.m. (CST). <P> NASA/MSFC Near Earth Asteroid Scout (NEAS) project is looking for a CubeSat-scale thruster system that can provide sufficient impulse to perform the mission-required maneuvers. NEAS is a 6U CubeSat launching on the Space Launch System (SLS) Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) with the goal of performing a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) flyby. The mission will use a Solar Sail primary propulsion system with the thruster system providing de-spin upon deployment and Z axial thrust capability (see Thruster System Volume Allocation figure below) to target a lunar flyby. Additionally, the system must provide 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) attitude maneuvering capability for the duration of the <2.5 year mission. <P> It is necessary that the thruster system fit in the footprint and volume allocated in the spacecraft. Our spacecraft is also sensitive to the mass of the thruster system, which should be minimized to the extent practical. It is intended that the thruster system be placed in ~2U at one end of the spacecraft, with the other ~4U unavailable. The five outer faces of the spacecraft which are adjacent to the approximately 2U volume allocation are accessible for thrusters, with some limitations. The exact volume requirements are detailed below. It is desired that the thruster system can be scaled in height to meet the final requirement without affecting performance other than the amount of propellant stored and the parameters directly following from that amount. If this scaling is possible, please provide approximate relationship of thruster system height to total impulse of the system. <P> The thruster system must accept a wiring harness from the ~4U volume at the geometric center of the Z face to provide power and data from the thruster system mounted solar panels, sun sensors, and thruster system itself. The wiring harness is < 0.4 inches (10.2 mm) in diameter, consists of a combination of wire and coax, and has a minimum bend radius requirement of < 0.5 inches (12.7 mm). <P> NEAS is considering two types of technologies for the propulsion system. The primary consideration is a warm-gas type of system. The method for warming the propellants can be tank/line heaters for raising the propellant temperature prior to entering the thruster or resistive heater elements in the thrust chambers themselves. A combination of these methods is also acceptable. The second option being considered is a purely cold-gas system. Programmatic considerations and lower delta-V requirements resulting from additional SLS flow down requirements may allow a simpler, lower cost, and less capable system to be used. In the event this is possible, a graceful transition from warm-gas to the less costly cold-gas system is highly desired. The decision point for when a down selection needs to be made should be indicated by the prime contractors in the response to this RFI. If possible, please provide a response for the warm gas system with de-scope options showing the path to the cold gas system if future programmatic decisions or technical challenges direct NASA 2 towards the simpler system. It is recognized that the total system impulse will be lower for the cold gas system. For the purposes of this RFI, please consider using the same propulsion system volume as the warm-gas system and report the resultant total impulse values. <P> NEAS is still evaluating the thruster-specific requirements needed to meet the mission requirements. The preliminary performance requirements are provided below, and should be considered to be the minimum/baseline that will meet the project requirements, but they may become tighter should a request for proposal (RFP) be issued. <P> In addition, NASA requests information about how much margin the supplier has in meeting the stated requirements, and identification of any requirements that are exceptionally challenging. If the vendor has multiple models that meet or exceed the requirements, we would be interested in getting information about each model. Please also include any information on options for multiple propellant tanks or irregular volume capacity for propellant storage. <P> This RFI includes the following elements below to assist in the development of the response to the RFI:  Table 1: Thruster System Constraints lists the current understanding of requirements for the system (including contextual information that may be of use in selecting a thruster design that will best meet the needs of NEAS).  Table 2: Requested Information for Each Thruster System lists the information we request in the reply to this RFI.  Figure 1: Thruster System Volume Allocation shows the allocated volume and footprint the thruster must fit into relative to the entire spacecraft.  Figure 2: Spacecraft Bus Design Concept shows a snapshot of the NEAS spacecraft bus. The thruster shown here is the current baseline and not a hard requirement. <P> This RFI includes the above mentioned tables and figures as an attachment. <P> When responding to this RFI, reference NNM16102915L in the subject line. <P> All responses shall be forwarded to LaBreesha B. Batey via electronic transmission at <a href="mailto:labreesha.b.batey@nasa.gov">labreesha.b.batey@nasa.gov </a> . It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained from this RFI. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as Proprietary or Confidential will be kept confidential. This request for information is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents will not be notified of the results. <P> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A>     .  The RFI and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. This notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be misunderstood as a Request for Proposal or a Request for Quotation or as an obligation on the part of The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) for conducting a follow-on acquisition. NIST does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for the information requested. No entitlement or payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by NIST will arise as a result of submission of responses to this notice and NIST use of such information.
<p>The Material Measurement Laboratory (MML) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops and maintains the scientific competencies necessary to provide the nation with a central basis for uniform physical measurements, measurement methodology, and measurement services fundamental to the processing, characterization, properties and performance of materials, and to other essential areas in materials science.</p>
<p>As part of its mission, international activities are essential to promote the advancement of international standards and maintain relationships with NIST's sister institutions abroad. The Versailles Project on Advanced Materials and Standards (VAMAS) is one such activity. The purpose of VAMAS is to develop the technical basis for international standards through collaborative research. Another activity is the World Materials Institute Forum (WMRIF), a body of executive leadership from publically funded materials research institutes around the globe and national measurement institutes aimed at fostering better international communication and scientific collaboration. The NIST MML Director will assume the Presidency of the WMRIF and related Secretariat duties in 2015. NIST is also playing a key management role in the VAMAS program.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates the need for a Contractor to provide professional services in analyzing international standards documentation, and providing support in the development of international standards. Additionally, the Government anticipates the need for a Contractor to provide professional services to organize and manage logistics for steering committee meetings, workshops, and general assembly meetings in support of NIST's participation in VAMAS and WMRIF.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, and small businesses. NIST has not made a determination whether this will be a small business set-aside. The small business size standard for the applicable NAICS code of 541690 is $15 million. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then it is anticipated that any competitive procurement that results from this notice will be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The following information is required to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Any relevant documentation which demonstrates your company's overall capability with respect to working with technical international round robin testing programs, pre-standard test method development, and supporting various standard-setting bodies such as American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), International Standards Organization (ISO), and the Committee of European Normalization (CEN).</p>
<p>2. Relevant documentation which demonstrates your company's capability with respects to reviewing and commenting on technical reports on international standards development and analysis.</p>
<p>3. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>Responses are limited to a total of five (5) pages of letter size paper with single spacing. Responses must be received via email to susan.ruzicka@nist.gov not later than 13 November, at 11:00 AM Eastern Time.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has made a significant investment in genomic-related programs and activities that provide comprehensive genomic, functional genomic, bioinformatics, proteomic, and systems biology resources to the scientific community for basic and applied research to rapidly address the Institute's mission and the Nation's biodefense needs (<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/pathogengenomics/pages/relatedinitiatives.aspx">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/pathogengenomics/pages/relatedinitiatives.aspx</a>). <br />These genomics programs and activities have not only provided the scientific community with valuable research resources, but have also enhanced the NIAID's research efforts in a number of areas including pathogen identification, investigation of pathogen virulence mechanisms, and drug and diagnostics development. Projects within these programs have utilized high-throughput (HTP) technologies to investigate the genome, transcriptome, proteome, or metabolome of a living organism, either as independent entities or as highly interrelated and interdependent components of biological systems.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>To build upon the objectives of the NIAID Genomics programs and continue to address the Institute's need to further expand the knowledge of the proteome of microbes and the understanding of functional roles of proteins in biological systems, and to support structure-guided design and discovery of new vaccines and therapeutics against infectious diseases, NIAID is re-competing the Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases program, herein referred to as the SGCID program. <br /><br />In 2007, the NIAID established two five-year contracts to support the SGCID program. These SGCID centers focused on determining three-dimensional (3D) structures of protein targets of biomedical interest. The targets' 3D structure information, as well as the expression clones and peptide materials for thousands of protein targets are made available to the scientific community. The SGCID program was re-competed in 2012 and two five-year contracts were awarded to: (<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/dmid/sg/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/dmid/sg/Pages/default.aspx</a>):<br /><br />1. SSGCID: Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Diseases <br />(Contract No. HHSN272201200025C)<br />2. CSGID: Center for Structural Genomics for Infectious Diseases <br />(Contract No. HHSN272201200026C)<br /><br />The goal of the SGCID program is to continue the experimental determination of 3D atomic structures of proteins and other molecules with an important biological role in human pathogens themselves, or molecules involved in host-pathogen interactions, by applying state-of-the art HTP technologies and methodologies. Pathogens include those included on the NIAID Category A-C Priority Pathogen lists and organisms causing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/Pages/CatA.aspx">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/Pages/CatA.aspx</a>). This program will also support research projects that utilize experimental approaches to better characterize the molecular mechanisms of protein targets and gain further insight into the functional roles of these targets. The knowledge of the 3D structures and molecular functions of protein targets will provide: 1) a structural view of biological processes and pathways to assist investigation at the systems level; and 2) insights into the target functional mechanisms, in interaction with other biological molecules or with synthetic compounds. In addition, this program will support projects that perform structure-guided vaccine design and drug discovery and conduct evaluation and validation of the underlying mechanism of action required for therapeutic use against infectious diseases. The structure-guided approach will provide improved selectivity, specificity and optimization of drug and vaccine identification and development in a rational way. The 3D structure information, reagents including expression clones and purified proteins, and services provided by the SGCID centers will be made freely available to the broad scientific community. <br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this anticipated solicitation is for scientific support of the SGCID program through a) generation of 3D structures for targets derived from bacterial, viral, eukaryotic and other human pathogens using HTP technologies and methodologies; b) conduct of studies to characterize molecular functions and biochemical properties of selected targets; c) conduct of studies for structure-guided design and functional evaluation of drug targets and vaccine candidates; d) provision of a 3D structure determination service to the external scientific community; and e) dissemination of contract generated resources, including all 3D structure information and reagents. <br /><br /><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance</strong></p>
<p>It is anticipated that one or more cost reimbursement, level of effort type contracts will be awarded with a one-year base period of performance beginning on or around June 1, 2017. Awards are expected to include 4 one-year option periods. The Government's base level of effort requirement is estimated at 35,360 labor hours for each contract year, equating to 17 FTE's with an FTE being defined as 2,080 hours. In addition to the base level of effort, each year of performance is anticipated to contain an option quantity for up to 6 additional FTEs.</p>

<p>Synopsis: Sources Sought</p>
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting market research for the purposes of identifying small businesses that have demonstrated capabilities to perform scientific support services which include environmental  and biological data collection; physical, biological, or biochemical analysis; fabrication, installation, operation, maintenance and repair of research equipment, and/or other peripheral support services. No solicitation of offers is made by this synopsis.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>A major component of the scientific program of the Fish Ecology (FE) Division, Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) is research directed at improving survival of Pacific salmon as they migrate to and from the ocean.  The development of the Federal Columbia River Hydropower System and the construction of numerous dams in the Columbia River Basin, along with major agricultural changes in water and land management in the region, have become major obstacles to both juvenile and adult salmon migrations.  This has significantly impacted natural fish production and has threatened the existence of many populations. Multiple stocks of Snake and Columbia River salmon and steelhead are currently listed as threatened or endangered under the Federal Endangered Species Act.</p>
<p>FE Division conducts research at dams, on boats in the Columbia River or Puget Sound estuaries, and in remote stream locations.  Some work is also conducted in offices or in workshops where staff work on vessels or operate fabrication machinery. The field work phases of the research projects mainly occur during the spring and summer periods when juvenile and adult salmonids migrate.  Some of these studies require large numbers of temporary and intermittent staff, including Fishery Biologists, Technicians, and Vessel and Equipment Operators to carry out their complex design.</p>
<p>Specific research projects are directed at:<br /> <br />1)	Collecting, processing, and analyzing field data on fish and environmental attributes. <br />2)	Performing population modeling for a variety of species and locations. <br />3)	Improving downstream survival of migrating juvenile salmonids.<br />4)	Assessing freshwater habitat capacities for salmonid. <br />5)	Improving passage conditions for migrating adult salmon and lamprey.<br />6)	Conducting juvenile and adult radio telemetry, acoustic, and PIT tag studies;<br />7)	Conducting studies on life cycle strategies in estuaries and river plumes; and<br />8)	Conducting oceanographic, benthic and plankton sampling studies.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, and is not a Request for Proposals or Quotes (RFP or RFQ). Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) requires a 360W Power Supply Unit (PSU) specifically designed for shipboard AN/UPX-24(V) Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF) system applications, that meet internally developed signal routing IFF Mode 5 design requirements. This RFI is released to determine if there are manufacturers who have an interest in providing fully qualified PSU for the AN/UPX-24(V) Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF) system. Those potential suppliers/manufacturers are asked to identify themselves as part of current market research to determine if competition is feasible for the required Power Supply.
<p>This RFI requests information from potential offerors able to provide PSUs for new systems that are built to existing NAWC-AD drawings. Currently, the system utilizes an AC/DC Multi-Channel PSU, Power Supply identified in NAWCAD system drawings DWG NO. 56769.</p>
<p>If competed, successful offerors would have to provide test reports from an independent test facility indicating that their unit has passed MIL-S-901D medium weight, Grade A, Class I Shock, MIL-STD-167-1A Mechanical Vibrations of Shipboard Equipment (Type I -Environmental and Type II Internally Excited), Mil-STD-461F Requirements for the Control of Electromagnetic Interface Emissions and Susceptibility, MIL-STD-1399-301A Interface Standard for Shipboard System, and MIL-DTL-5541F Chemical Conversion Coatings on Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys. Compliance certification testing would be the responsibility of the offeror, not the Government.</p>
<p>The AN/UPX-24(V) system requires a 360W Power Supply Unit (PSU) specifically designed for the existing shipboard Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF) system applications, and will meet internally developed signal routing IFF Mode 5 design requirements. Physical requirements include: AC active power factor correction input, input: 115VAC L-L 1&Oslash; 60Hz, output: +3.3v, +5v, &plusmn;12v, power: 360W, 0.85W/in3, size: 9.9" X 11.9" X 3.6" and must be MIL STD-1399 compliant as well as capable of passing standard Military Environmental Stress Screening (ESS) Testing. The required PSU must be a form, fit, and functional replacement for previously fielded equipment used by the AN/UPX-24(V) system.</p>
<p>Currently, the system utilizes an AC/DC Multi-Channel PSU, Power Supply identified in NAWCAD system drawings under P/N 56769, which references P/N: VTA98019-01, a commercially available variant from Viable Power Conversion Technologies Inc. (CAGE Code 3AJ03). The required PSU must be a form, fit, and functional replacement built to the NAVAIR Drawings Specifications for previously fielded equipment used by the AN/UPX-24(V) system. Because the drawing is export controlled, it would only be released as part of an RFP Package mailed out by NAWC-AD. A Pre-solicitation Notice will request potential offerors to provide a copy of their approved DD2345, MILITARILY CRITICAL TECHNICAL DATA AGREEMENT. If NAWC-AD decides to proceed with the acquisition once the Pre-solicitation Notice closes, RFP packages will be mailed out to those vendors who provided the necessary DD2345. Potential providers would have the same amount of time to respond to the RFP.</p>
<p>Once again, this is a Request for Information only, not an RFP or RFQ. The only action requested is to self-identify interest in providing PSUs to NAWC-AD for Market Research purposes only. In addition, any literature provided will be forwarded to the NAWC-AD engineers, however, no feedback on those products will be provided.&nbsp; <br /><br />All responses should be via electronic email.&nbsp; Interested Contractors should contact Mr. Robert Battaglia, <a href="mailto:robert.battaglia@navy.mil">robert.battaglia@navy.mil</a>.</p>

NAVIGATION SEAMANSHIP AND SHIP-HANDLING
CONTRACTOR INSTRUCTOR SERVICES (NSS CIS)
N61340-16-R-0016

The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, is seeking potential sources with the ability to provide Contractor Instruction Services (CIS) for Navigation, Seamanship and Shiphandling (NSS) training located at multiple sites worldwide.  

It is anticipated that a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract will be awarded. The Period of Performance (POP) of this contract is 60 months, inclusive of one (1) base year and four (4) 12-month options. Start of contractor performance will be 15 June 2016 inclusive of 60 days mobilization period.

NSS training sites are located in US Navy Fleet Concentration Areas and include high fidelity shiphandling simulators.
 The anticipated services to be provided are delivery of Contractor Instructor training using standard industry equipment as well as the scheduling and coordination of training events through the administration of a web-based scheduling tool to provide accessibility to ships at sea. 
There are ten (10) sites that will require training on an on-call basis in response to the operational schedule of the fleet. Six (6) of the sites are in the Continental U.S. (CONUS) while four (4) of the sites are Outside the Continental U.S. (OCONUS). The six CONUS sites are Mayport, FL, Norfolk, VA, San Diego, CA, Everett, WA, Pearl Harbor, HI, and Newport, RI. The four OCONUS sites are Sasebo, Japan, Yokosuka, Japan, Manama, Bahrain, and Rota, Spain.

Examples of the types of instruction to be provided are Bridge Resource Management (BRM) and Basic Ship-Handling (BSH), Surface Command Assessment, Navigation and Ship-handling Special Evolutions and various other Navigation and Ship-handling bridge watch-stander scenarios.
  

Based on a preliminary risk assessment conducted by NAWCTSD, this task is expected to be competed under the unrestricted LOT of FTSS III.  The risk assessment took into account the complexity of managing this dynamic training requirement to include OCONUS sites and the associated requirement for continuous connectivity to the operational fleet. Overseas contracts have inherent risks which may include but are not limited to unique tax implications and a lack of fully defined issues affecting these types of contracts. During the acquisition planning stage for FTSS III, it was determined that small businesses were not suitable for contracts that had overseas components. In addition to this inherent complexity, the requirement for delivery of a web based scheduling tool with fleet connectivity raises the risk to an unacceptable level.

Businesses potentially willing to submit a proposal are invited to provide a capabilities statement which contains, at a minimum, business size and the Lot(s) that they have been awarded contracts under the Fielded Training Support Systems (FTSS III) Multiple Award Contract (MAC).
 NAWCTSD requests any small businesses with a compelling argument as to why their firm should be eligible to propose to this task, submit a capabilities statement inclusive of the following: (1) justification that shows how the inherent risks associated with this requirement can be mitigated to include demonstration of successful Past Performance in a similarly complex environment; (2) contracts with a minimum of two (2) OCONUS sites and four (4) CONUS sites simultaneously, for contractor instructor services; (3) dollar values and site locations; and (4) Point of Contact (POC) for each site to include name, address, phone, email. Summaries should be no longer than five (5) pages in length. 

Information should be sent via e-mail to Shaan.Charran@navy.mil, Responses are requested by 9 November 2015.
 The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, nor for the Government to pay for the information received.  No request for proposal solicitation document exists at this time. Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Shaan A. Charran, via email Shaan.Charran@navy.mil or by telephone at (407)380-8125.

<DESC><br />Sources Sought Notice and Market Research for Design Build Services for a new 20,000 SF space and related site work at Vandenberg AFB, CA.<br /><br />This is a Sources Sought Notice and IS NOT a solicitation announcement. The purpose of this Market Research and Sources Sought Notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified firms. Responses to this Sources sought will be used by the Government in making appropriate acquisition decisions. <br /><br />Description of Work:
<p>The new Building is to be constructed as SCIF space, meeting the requirements of ICD/ICS 705, and is to include the necessary spaces to accommodate the following main elements: NROV Commander (CC): This area is to have a reception area, required CC and staff offices (space for visitors) and its own conference room. This area will also have both a red and black copy area. Operations Group (DO): This area will house the Director of Operations and contain offices, a conference room, and related support functions. Launch Management Center (LMC): This area will house the LMC along with two conference rooms and the LMC IT/Tech support room. A large Multi-Purpose Room with video wall will also be incorporated into this new space.</p>
<p>Utility: The new Building will have designated space for required utilities and mechanical systems.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: The new Building will require a lobby/reception area, a break room, two sets of women's and men's restrooms, two storage areas/closets, and a janitor's closet.</p>
<p>In an effort to coordinate with the existing building's cast-in-place and pre-cast concrete panels, the contractor may choose from one of the following wall systems, so long as it complies with the R and U factor requirements of ASHRAE 90.1-2010 for mass walls and with the minimum structural requirements. A combination of the following systems may be used as long as the performance requirements specified herein are met and in coordination with the NRO: Concrete Masonry Units (CMU) and CMU Veneer; Precast Insulated Concrete Panel; Tilt-Up Concrete Panels; Insulated Concrete Forms (ICF); Insulated Metal Wall Panels; Precast Elements. Interior steel columns and beams are necessary to support a bar joist or truss roof framing. The roof will predominantly be low slope, although steep slope elements are allowed, with metal decking, layers of rigid insulation, and a covering of a membrane roofing material.</p>
<p>In addition to general site clearing, the site demolition includes removal of an existing small 20 space parking lot for GSA vehicles, with minor fence removal and replacement. Minor utility removal and relocation shall be required for water, sewer, electrical and communication. Site should be graded away from the building to allow for positive drainage and any necessary storm water controls installed. Sidewalk and fire access roads are to be added as necessary or required by code. This project includes two new parking lots. In addition to the new parking lots, 4 VIP spaces shall be relocated and 7 Handicap Spaces shall be added. One parking lot shall be added to the west of the proposed facility to replace the demolished GSA parking lot. A new driveway off of 32nd Street shall provide access to this new parking lot. Another new parking area is sited west of the existing large parking lot. This parking area will add approximately 100 spaces. Access to this new parking area shall be from the existing parking lot. Additionally, a second access drive from California Avenue will be added. The 4 VIP and 7 Handicap Spaces shall be located north of the proposed facility, off of 32nd Street. The installation of these parking spaces will require re-grading of an existing drainage swale and rerouting drainage to a new storm sewer pipe. New parking lots shall have Hot Mix Asphalt Concrete (HMAC) pavement.</p>
<p>The building addition shall be tied into the existing electronic security systems. Security equipment is anticipated to be provided and installed by OSL. Security fencing shall be provided around the new building and will tie into the existing security fencing. Due to the relocation of the fence, two camera towers and the associated underground cabling that runs around the current fenced perimeter, will need to be relocated. New turnstiles shall be located north of the new building entrance to provide access.<br /><br />A landscape design which reduces water demand, decreases excess run-off and blends well with the existing facility landscape and existing surrounding natural environment will be designed and constructed. Primary consideration is to create a congruous pedestrian path system which efficiently and harmoniously integrates the existing building with the new one, the existing POV and GOV parking and new and existing site features and reduce existing turf and replace with xeriscape type planting features.<br /><br />The estimated magnitude of construction is greater than $20,000,000.00.<br />North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this acquisition is 236220.<br /><br />Small Business Size Standard for this acquisition is $36.5 Million.<br /><br />Interested sources shall submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to perform the work as described above.

<DESC>Description: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement to determine interest, availability and capability of 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and Small Business concerns. The NAICS code for the work described below is 237110. The estimated construction cost is between $10,000,000 and $20,000,000. Work will begin in summer of 2016 and will extend through 2017.
<p>The location of services to be performed under this contract shall be in Durham and Middletown, Connecticut. The project will include approximately 24,000 linear feet of 6" through 16" ductile iron water mains; a 1 million gallon pre-stressed concrete or steel elevated water storage tank with new access road; hydrants, valves, tees and other fittings; service connections to approximately 200 buildings; two blow-off valve assemblies; three vaults for an altitude valve, and meter, and a pressure reducing valve; modifications to the existing Long Hill Pump Station in Middletown; site work including blasting, storm drains, and paving; and abandonment of approximately 110 private drinking wells.</p>
<p>The new waterline will be installed on heavily travelled state and local roads and will require traffic control and management. Many of the water service connections are for private homes. Real estate in Durham for construction storage and oversight is very limited. Portions of the work are in historically sensitive areas that will require oversight and documentation by a historic preservation specialist, and coordination with the State Historical Preservation Office. A small portion of the work is in an area with contaminated soil.

<p>Phone: (509) 527-7220<br />Fax: (509) 527-7802<br />E-mail: Nona.R.Fincher@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>Response deadline:</p>
<p>November 12, 2015 at 3:00 p.m. (Pacific Time Zone)</p>
<p>Place of Performance:</p>
<p>Work will be performed in the area between Lower Granite Reservoir (near Lewiston, ID) and on the Columbia River (near Portland, OR</p>
<p>Description of the Requirement:</p>
<p>Provide four towboats, each staffed with crews for 24-hour per day operation, to transport Government-owned fish barges from Lower Granite Juvenile Fish Facility to fish release areas below Bonneville Dam. Stops will be made at Little Goose and Lower Monumental dams to load additional fish or to pick up an additional fish barge for transport to the release site. The initiation of barging operations is based on runoff projections. During years when runoff is forecasted to be near or above normal or average runoff, barging of fish could begin as late as May 1. During low flow or drought years, barging of fish may<br />begin as early as 21 April. Transporting of fish by barge from Snake River dams will therefore begin sometime between April 21 and May 1, as directed by the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative, and should last until approximately mid-August when fish numbers will decline to where<br />trucks will be used for their transport. The Contractor will routinely transport a loaded fish barge from Lower Granite Dam, stop and pick up a loaded fish barge at Little Goose Dam, and then continue on the trip downstream to the release site.</p>
<p>During the 2016 transport season and possibly the 2017 transport season, up to 4 barge trips may take place on a weekly basis during the month of April in support of fish research. In 2016, construction activities at Lower Granite Dam will likely force the termination of fish barge transport operations on or about August 1.</p>

Draft Statement of Work:

The Healthcare for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Program is authorized by 38 U.S.C. 2031 and 38 CFR Part 63.  The HCHV program is an essential and critical part of VHA, providing a gateway to VA and community-based supportive services for eligible Veterans who are homeless.  HCHV programs provide outreach services; care, treatment, and rehabilitative services, including case management services; and therapeutic transitional housing assistance under 38 U.S.C. 2032 in conjunction with Work Therapy under 38 U.S.C. 1718.  The program uses Contracted Residential Services in community locations to engage homeless Veterans who have been underserved.  Many of these Veterans would benefit from mental health and Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment but will not avail themselves of these services without the encouragement of outreach workers.  The purpose of this solicitation is for the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) in Tucson, AZ to obtain offers from contractors who can provide any of the: services, care, treatment, or rehabilitative, to include case management services to homeless Veteran suffering from serious mental illness in a community-based treatment facility offering a safe and secure environment.

The targeted population is serious, mentally ill, homeless veterans who require care and services over and above the level of room and board. Eligible veterans must be diagnosed with a serious mental illness, but who are psychiatrically stable and will not be a danger to self, agency staff or property.  Professional treatment and clinical services, including, psychiatric, social, rehabilitative and recreation services will be determined by the individual patient, VA Contract Liaison and the contractor. The contracting agency staff will provide case management and supportive services in collaboration with the VA Contract Liaison.

Applicants also should note that all facilities, unless they are specifically exempted under the Life Safety Code, are required to have an operational sprinkler system. Contractors are required to ensure that facilities used for this contract meet the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines for accessible accommodations for Veterans with physical limitations or impairments.

<DESC>THIS IS A Request for Information (RFI) NOTICE ONLY, and is being used as an instrument to identify potential sources that can provide the capabilities described below. The information provided in this notice is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. PEO STRI has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed and the Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All cost associated with this RFI will be solely at the expense of the respondents. Additionally, all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Any information considered proprietary or confidential information shall be clearly marked as such. No basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this RFI. <br>  <br> Brief Summary: The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is conducting market research to determine interested sources and technology capabilities of industry business entities (both large and small) and academia for their participation in the concept definition and development of a Synthetic Training Environment (STE) architecture solution.  Since the STE will be composable, it is not a requirement for all portions of the STE architecture to come from a single prime contractor, so please respond even if you feel you can only fulfill a portion or component of the overall solution. <br>  <br> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: PEO STRI has a need for a multi-echelon, cognitive, collective training capability delivered from the cloud to the points of need, on demand via operational networks.  U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capabilities Manager will provide evolving requirements to PEO STRI. The STE will be a soldier-centric training environment optimizing human performance.  It will converge the Virtual, Constructive, and Gaming training capabilities into a single-synthetic environment.  The STE will provide a common, collective training capability for the operational, institutional, and self-development training domains across all echelons.  The STE will blend virtual, augmented, and physical realities, providing commanders with multiple tailorable capabilities to train operational complexities.  It will be capable of operating when network conditions are less than optimal to include disconnected, intermittent and limited bandwidth network conditions.  The STE will support train as you fight, commander-driven, unit mission-oriented Decisive Action training in support of Unified Land Operations.  The STE will provide intuitive, composable applications and services that enable embedded training with platforms and mission command information systems. <br> This notice is provided to inform industry partners and academia and solicit knowledge of their capabilities to fulfill the requirements and level of interest for a STE program.  The Army's strategy for execution of the STE program is to take advantage of emerging technologies available in the commercial market.   <br>  <br> The STE should include the following characteristics: <br> 1. One single synthetic environment, merging the current Virtual, Constructive, and Gaming training capabilities. <br> 2. Provide one geospatial capability, representing the Earth, land, sea, air space, mega cities, cyber, cultural and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives (CBRNE). <br> 3. Provide distributed collective training capabilities that leverage cloud-enabled technologies. <br> 4. Comprise a modular and extensible (component-based and functionally decomposable) multi-layer software architecture <br> 5. Support scalable and composable scenarios and exercises from Squad to Echelons above Corps with and without Unified Action Partners. <br> 6. Support an open systems architecture responsive to rapid development of training applications by multiple providers. <br> 7. Provide streaming interactive content from the cloud (medium and high fidelity, immersive and semi immersive content) to the points of need. <br> 8. Leverage open source, non-proprietary industry standards and protocols; eliminating the current simulation federations and their protocols. Emphasis should be on leveraging and extending commercial standards where possible.  <br> 9. Interact with the Live training environment. <br> 10. Provide exercise and scenario management capabilities. <br> 11. Provide data management capabilities. <br> 12. Provide terrain and model editors. <br> 13. Provide Semi-Automated Forces (SAF)/Artificial Intelligence. <br> 14. Embedded Intelligent Tutors. <br> 15. Provide optimized content for various end devices (e.g., PC, tablets, mobile hand held, zero/thin clients, and head mounted displays). <br> 16. Easy to operate and maintain. <br> 17. Provide rapid and adaptable mission planning capability. <br> 18. Require minimal initialization time. <br> 19. Provide exportable/deployable capabilities. <br> 20. Include content distribution network; load balancing; data repository locations, etc. <br> 21. Support training with Joint, Inter-governmental, Inter-agency, Multinational, and Unified Action Partners. <br> 22. Provide real-time, synchronized content across variable, geographically distributed network conditions/limitations. <br> 23. Minimize software licensing costs. <br>  <br> The STE must comply with the following conditions: <br> 1. Comply with the Army Core Data Center Architecture. <br> 2. Comply with the Common Operating Environment (COE) Architecture. <br> 3. Distribute training on operational networks, e.g., Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN); Army Enterprise Network (AEN): Mission Partner Environment; LandWarNet; and tactical networks. <br> 4. Natively interoperable with Mission Command.   <br> 5.

<DESC><strong>Potential NAICS Codes:</strong> 333318 - Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing / 334220 - Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing
<p><strong><br />BRIEF DESCRIPTION:</strong> <br /><br />The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager for Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (PM CTIS) has a requirement to procure a system of equipment that will enable aviation Observer/Coach Trainer (O/CT) groups located at the National Training Center (NTC) and Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) to communicate via voice among themselves and with users of the newly fielded Combat Training Center - Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) Range Communication System (RCS) voice cellular devices also known as Combat Trainer Communications Subsystem - Voice (CTCS-V).</p>
<p>At the NTC the aviation O/CTs currently utilize radios mounted in the Observation Helicopter - 58 (OH-58) and Utility Helicopter - 60 (UH-60) aircrafts to communicate with other users on the existing RCS. The aviation communication system is comprised of European Aeronautics Defense and Space (EADS) radios using the Tetrapol specification. At the JRTC the aviation O/CTs utilize Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radios present in the UH-72, also known as the Light Utility Helicopter (LUH), to communicate with other users on the existing Project 25 (P25) specification based RCS.</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:<br /></strong><br />a. The solution shall support CTCS-V Cisco Instant ConnectC software, and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 140-2 encrypted push to talk (PTT) voice communications with CTCS-V users via talk groups similar to a Land Mobile Radio system.</p>
<p>b. The solution for each training center must support Aviation O/CT communications from all three types of aircraft with other Aviation O/CTs and with CTCS-V users;</p>
<p>c. The solution shall be able to operate independent of the existing RCS network infrastructure at each center as it will be replaced by the new CTC-IS RCS / CTCS-V;</p>
<p>d. Equipment needing to be carried onto or physically or electrically interfaced with the aircraft shall meet applicable Army and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airworthiness requirements and receive an Airworthiness Release (AWR);</p>
<p>e. Equipment needing to be mounted in or on aircraft shall mount so as not to interfere with existing equipment and ideally fit in the same position as any equipment being removed;</p>
<p>f. The solution shall enable communication via the aircraft intercom system and have ease of use for pilots while the aircrafts are in operation;</p>
<p>g. Approximate count for aircrafts requiring this solution are a total of 56 for NTC and JRTC combined, spread among the platforms listed above.</p>
<p><strong>ACQUISITION APPROACH:</strong> An acquisition approach has yet to be determined. The Government is currently refining requirements and will utilize industries capability statement responses to assist in developing the appropriate acquisition approach.<strong><br /><br />RESPONSES REQUESTED:</strong> The purpose of this request is to gain knowledge of types of equipment that may be currently available that will meet the requirement.

<DESC>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Research and Development Center - Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (ERDC-CRREL) in Hanover, NH requires an extension of Janitorial Services from the period of 1 February 2016 through 31 July 2016. These services include six (6) months of daily janitorial services at the CRREL site in accordance with FAR 52.217-8, which allows for an extension of performance not exceeding six (6) months. The current contract period ends on 31 January 2016. An extension to the existing contract is in the best interest of the Government because it will ensure that no lapse in service occurs while a follow-on contract is being worked through the acquisition process. These services are on the AbilityOne Procurement List and are performed by a SourceAmerica Non-Profit Agency under the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act as a mandatory source of services IAW FAR 8.002(a)(2). Due to delays in acquisition planning, it is anticipated that the follow-on contract will not executed timely to avoid a lapse in service.
<p>ERDC-CRREL intends to execute a modification to the current contract, W913E5-11-P-0018, on a sole source basis to Northern New England Employment Services in accordance with FAR 13.106(b)(1). The Janitorial Services at ERDC-CRREL are currently on the AbilityOne Procurement List, which requires ERDC to procure these services through SourceAmerica until and unless SourceAmerica can no longer find a Non-Profit Agency capable of performing the services.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561720 which has a size standard of $18,000,000.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement. Any interested party that believes they can fulfill this requirement should submit a capability statement to be reviewed. All submissions will be considered, however there is no guarantee that submissions in response to this notice will in any way alter the Government's acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>Please provide responses to this notice no later than 4 November 2015, at 12:00 pm, Central Time, to:</p>
<p>kim.d.roberson@usace.army.mil</p>

<SUBJECT>Expended Brass Casings 
<SOLNBR>W912LQ-16-S-0001
<RESPDATE>110515
<CONTACT>Susan Swanson, Contracting Officer, Phone 4342986293, Fax 434-298-6202, Email susan.e.swanson5.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The Virginia Army National Guard has a requirement to dispose of deformed brass casings from two locations at Fort Pickett, Blackstone, Virginia. The casings include 5.56, 7.62 and .50 caliber stored in 55-gallon drums and hoppers. The Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) has approximately 100,000 lbs of expended brass stored; the majority of the casings are in hoppers with approximately 10 pallets with four barrels on each. This quantity may increase if the facility continues to process over the next two weeks. At the Recycle Yard, approximately 45,000 lbs in dump hoppers. These two facilities are approximately two miles apart on the installation. The contractor is responsible for pick up at both locations as the government will not consolidate the material and will not provide assistance with loading.
<p>While the material in both locations is being sold under one contract, the material must be tabulated separately. Weigh tickets for the different locations will be clearly marked as "ASP" and "Recycle" to allow each location to be accounted for individually. The casings at the ASP have been demiled by way of crushing/crimping. The casings at the Recycle yard have been demiled via a safety certification unit ("popping"). All material has been certified inert in accordance with Department of Defense Instruction Number 4715.4.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a weigh ticket for each truck when it is empty and after it has been loaded. In addition, certification of the scales used shall be provided. The weight of the pallets and/or barrels will be deducted from the tare weight. The contractor shall pay the government for the difference based on these weights. No consideration will be given for material "lost" during processing in the contractor's facility. A government representative shall be onsite to verify the amount of material loaded per truck. The purchaser's weights shall be compared and reconciled to the government estimate.</p>
<p>The purchaser shall provide payment in one of the accepted formats within 7 calendar days of removal. Payment is to be made payable to US Treasury; remittance shall indicate it is for the purchase of U.S. Government Property. Acceptable forms of payment include certified check or money order only.</p>
<p>The contractor must empty the barrels on-site. Removal and return will not be authorized. Contractor is to provide all necessary personnel and material-handling equipment to empty the barrels at the ASP into contractor provided containers. The contractor shall reimburse the Virginia Army National Guard for any barrels damaged during this process at a rate of $15 per barrel.</p>
<p>Of the random sampling of drum weights, the average weight is 550 lbs per drum. The drums are covered at this location so the government does not anticipate water accumulation within the drums. In addition, the material has been certified as inert.</p>
<p>Material pick up will be accomplished from 8:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday through Thursday of each week. Contractor will not be allowed on site Mondays and Fridays. A government employee will be assigned to escort and assist the contractor with staging barrels and/or forklift operation. The contractor employees shall have government-issued photo identification on their person at all times and shall be escorted at all times. Contractor employees will not wander away from the work area and/or bring cameras or camera phones onto the installation.</p>
<p>A site visit is scheduled for Tuesday, 3 November 2015 at 10:00 a.m. at the ASP and 10:30 a.m. ET at the Recycle yard to provide vendors an opportunity to assess the quantity and type of each material, level of effort required to remove material, security limitations etc. Attendance is not mandatory, but interested vendors are strongly encouraged to attend to become familiar with the facility, ask questions etc. As a result of security restrictions, this is the only opportunity vendors will have to access the site prior to the bid opening. Interested bidders are required to register by contacting Ms Susan Swanson, Contract Specialist, at susan.e.swanson5.civ@mail.mil. Only those people with prior approval will be allowed access to the closed facility. Attendees are to have a government issued photo ID with them to gain entry.</p>
<p>A deposit is not required to submit a bid however, within three (3) business days of award, the successful contractor must provide an earnest money deposit of 20% of the total bid price to the Contracting Officer. This deposit will be held for the duration of the project.</p>
<p>The contractor may remove materials up to the value of the deposit. These loads must be paid for within seven (7) calendar days of removal and before additional loads are removed. The check, along with weight tickets, must be submitted to the Contracting Officer on the seventh day. Therefore, the contractor should be prepared to reconcile and pay for loads weekly. The VaARNG reserves the right to retain the deposit until such time as all weight tickets have been received and the purchaser has paid in full all invoices for all property removed. Interest will accrue on all late payments at the daily rate of 2.375% in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 611 (https://www.fms.treas.gov/prompt/index.html). In addition, an administrative fee may be charged to collect a delinquent payment. Acceptable forms of bid deposit include certified check, money order and company check.</p>
<p>Bids are to be submitted in pounds on the SF114F form.</p>
<p>Bids are due by 2:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, 5 November 2015. Bids may be delivered in person, mailed or faxed to Susan Swanson, Contract Specialist, USPFO-ACQ, Building 316, Fort Pickett, Blackstone, VA 23824. Seller reserves the right to refuse all bids. Telephonic bids will not be accepted. Any questions are to be directed to Ms. Swanson at 434-298-6293, fax 434-298-6202 or email at susan.e.swanson5.civ@.mail.mil.</p>

52.203-99 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN INTERNAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS (FEB 2015) --(a) The Contractor shall not require employees or subcontractors seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign or comply with internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. (b) The contractor shall notify employees that the prohibitions and restrictions of any internal confidentiality agreements covered by this clause are no longer in effect. (c) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this clause does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. (d)(1) In accordance with section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

(2) The Government may seek any available remedies in the event the Contractor fails to comply with the provisions of this clause.
52.209-5 -- CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (OCT 2015) (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

"Small business concern," as used in this clause, means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the size standards in this solicitation. (b) Applicability. This clause applies only to--(1) Contracts that have been totally set aside or reserved for small business concerns; and (2) Orders set aside for small business concerns under multiple-award contracts as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F).*(c) General.

An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. An "established market price" is a current price, established in the usual course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror;   (3) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (4) The offeror uses the same compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract as the offeror uses for these employees and for equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Labor Standards statute- (1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Labor Standards clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or (2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis.

(f) The Government shall pay contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes clause.

(g) If, after termination, it is determined that the Contractor was not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for the convenience of the Government.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Configuration Change Management - Engineering Change Proposal, Requests for Variance (Deviation or Waiver) February 2015<br />1. Requirements<br />A. The Configuration Change Management section of SAE EIA-649-1 Configuration Management Requirement for Defense Contracts, Paragraph 3.3, shall be used for Configuration Control of material purchased under this contract.</p>
<p>B. Furnished item(s) shall conform to the approved configuration requirements/revision specified, unless a Pre-Production Request for Variance (deviation) or a Post-Production Request for Variance (waiver), is processed and approved as provided by Paragraph 3. in this Standard Text Object (STO). Hereafter, the term #Request for Variance (RFV) # will also include Requests for Deviations and Waivers.</p>
<p>2. The definitions from EIA-649-1 apply to items being procured under this solicitation/contract, with the following clarification of Deviation &amp; Waiver:<br />A. Pre-Production RFV (previously known as deviation) requests permission to produce a product that does not conform to contract requirements/documentation for a limited amount of time and for specified effectivity. (A deviation differs from an engineering change in that an approved engineering change requires corresponding revision of the item's current approved configuration documentation, whereas a deviation does not.).</p>
<p>B. Post-Production RFV (previously known as waiver) requests approval of product found during manufacture, or after having been submitted for Government inspection or acceptance, that departs from specified requirements, but nevertheless is considered suitable for use "as is" or after repair by an approved method.</p>
<p>3. Contractor responsibilities.<br />A. An Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) is used to make permanent changes in the Government technical data package (TDP). Pending approval of an ECP, contractual relief should be requested in writing by the Contractor using a RFV.<br />B. Refer to FAR Part 48 Value Engineering for cost saving improvements to the Technical Data Package (TDP).</p>
<p>C. All ECPs submitted by the Contractor will be deemed routine. If the Contractor considers an ECP as an emergency or urgent; they shall include in their ECP submittal an explanation and all applicable supporting documentation.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>

These parts require engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.
 An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activitys procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.

Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for these items have been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
  If you
are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS)
Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx\

These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.\

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request
for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data
required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval
requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.  The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification

These parts require engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.
 An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activitys procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award,
as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.

Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for these items have been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
  If you
are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS)
Source Approval Information Brochures listed below.

Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx\

These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.\

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request
for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data
required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval
requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.  The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA), Great Lakes Region 5, announces an opportunity to provide General Construction Services for the Restoration of Wood Paneling Project at the U.S. Post Office located at 211 S. Clark Street in Chicago, Illinois. The procurement will be issued as a lump sum, firm fixed-price contract open to all business concerns. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. The NAICS code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The Small Business Size Standard is $36.5 Million.<br /><br />
<p>Project Scope: The intent of the project is to repair and restore historic wood paneling, wood doors, wood trim work, as well as other associated woodwork. The project will also include the fabrication and installation of a new decorative bronze metal railing system to protect the woodwork from future damage. The Loop Station Post Office building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, so all work must be performed in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. The duration of the contract is 210 calendar days from Notice to Proceed to Final Completion.</p>
<p>The "best value trade-off process" will be utilized in this procurement for the evaluation of offers and the selection of the successful Offeror to receive the award.  The Government will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of both the technical factors and the total evaluated price.  For this procurement, the technical factors will be significantly more important than price.  The technical factors will include past experience on similar projects, experience of key personnel and past performance on similar projects.</p>
<p>Small Business Participation:  This procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns. Although this procurement is open to large business, small businesses are encouraged to participate. The offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, disadvantaged, veteran owned, service disabled veteran owned and HUBZone businesses through subcontracting opportunities.  In the event a large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement) is the awardee, an acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by SBA prior to award of this contract. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to have participation from small, small disadvantaged, small woman-owned, small HUBZone and small veteran-owned business concerns.</p>
<p>Joint Ventures: Joint venture or firm/ consultant arrangements will be considered and must submit an acceptable joint venture agreement.</p>

Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation package from the FedBizOpps website, https://www.fbo.gov, and for monitoring for possible amendments and/or additional information.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference and site-visit will be held on or about December 1, 2015 and notification to the Contract Specialist of proposed attendance will be required.  We consider attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive and cost effective proposal and to understanding the total result desired by the Government. Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions and miscalculations in offers. The offers are due on or about December 16, 2015 at 4:00 pm. (CST).</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award offerors are required to provide electronic representations and certifications in System for Award Management (SAM) accessed via https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact:</p>

B.2 STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (SOO)

1.0 BACKROUND


The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Affairs Center for Innovation (VACI) is a leader in healthcare innovation. Specifically, VA's employees have been the source of some of VA's most notable innovations. However, cultural and operating constraints have increasingly diminished the organization's ability to leverage the considerable energies and talents of our staff.  A new approach is needed - a bold, program that partners Department of Veterans Affairs in collaboration with a recognized brand with healthcare innovation to celebrate, amplify, and accelerate innovations for our nation's Veterans and their supporters at VA. 

VA wishes to partner with a unique, forward-thinking healthcare innovation contractor and its associated community. This program will allow VA to be a part of a multidisciplinary community of thinkers and doers all committed to making a difference in health and medicine. This community recognizes that advancements in health and medicine are not going to be made in individual organizations but rather by bringing together all sectors of society across all fields of study. Most organizations in health and medicine today are focused on a single silo (i.e., Digital Health, Cardiology, Oncology) and represent a singularly focused initiative and community. The contractor should be identified as one of the most credible and recognized idea sharing platforms in health and medicine -the brand and what it stands for is recognized around the world. Our vision for this program is to provide live stream access to the contactors live program to VA Medical Centers to amplify the message behind a "Week of Breakthrough Innovation for Veterans."  The goal is to amplify VA's incredible innovation efforts in an engaging way to draw excitement and interest to innovation efforts at VA and to accelerate the development of game-changing, breakthrough innovations to develop the best possible services, technologies, and experiences for Veterans and their supporters.

<DESC>This solicitation, SP4708-15-R-0001, was previously synopsized on January 15, 2015 under the FBO Presolicitation Notice "SP4708-15-R-0001(Update)".&nbsp; The solicitation&nbsp;can be accessed by selecting&nbsp;and downloading the attachments to this notice.&nbsp; Prospective offerors are advised to download and review all attached materials prior to responding to this solicitation.<br /><br /><strong>* Amendment 0007 has been issued to replaced the Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) clause.&nbsp; The most recent versions of Attachments 1, 2, and 4 have been&nbsp;included&nbsp;in the attachment package for convenience. <br />* Amendment 0006 has been&nbsp;issued as "Refresh No. 2",&nbsp;revising various portions of the solicitation, and extended the closing date for the period ending October 30, 2015 to November 20, 2015.&nbsp;Please be sure to download, complete, and submit&nbsp;all attachments. as applicable.</strong><br />* Amendment 0005 has been issued to add additional PSCs to Table A.6.2.1. <br />* Amendment 0004 has been issued to: update the table of "Quarterly Last Month Open Periods", extending the period opening on 06 July 2015 to 14 August 2015; add additional PSCs to Table A.6.2.1; provide updated "Questions and Answers" (see Attachments); add requirement for vendor verification regarding excluded items (see Attachments); and other revisions providing clarifications regarding excluded items.<br />* Amendment 0003 has been issued as "Refresh No. 1", revising various portions of the solicitation, resulting in editorial changes and updated terms and conditions.<br />* Amendment 0002 has been issued updating the table of "Quarterly Last Month Open Periods".&nbsp; <br />* Amendment 0001 has been issued in order to provide guidance on formatting requirements.<br /><br /><br /><br />DOD EMALL is an internet-based ordering service that allows customers to make a "Best Value" decision for products from a variety of sources through a single entry point based on price, delivery, product description, vendor performance, or other factors required to meet mission objectives.<br /><br />This DOD EMALL solicitation seeks to establish Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) type contracts for various commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items which will be ordered through the DOD EMALL system for delivery to DOD EMALL customers worldwide. DOD EMALL customers include DoD military and non-military customers, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) acting as or on behalf of the customer, and customers of other Government entities (including Federal, State, and/or Local). This solicitation is being issued as part of a Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program using the guidance of FAR and DFARS Subpart 8.4 for ordering procedures. (See DLAD 8.400-90 DoD electronic mall (EMALL) and FAR 38.000 Federal Supply Schedule Contracting). The DoD MAS program is designed to provide logistic support that empowers the customer to select the product that best meets their mission needs using best value ordering procedures. <br /><br />This solicitation shall remain open for period not to exceed five (5) years in total length, unless sooner replaced by an updated solicitation, with recurring opening and closing periods on a quarterly basis. <br /><br />The intention of this solicitation is to make multiple awards for the entire spectrum of categories of items required. The maximum quantity of supplies for this acquisition is set at $100 Million (M) based on the aggregated total value of all of the individual IDIQ maximums to be established for each individual contract awarded as a result of this solicitation. The guaranteed minimum dollar value that the Government agrees to order during the period of any awarded contract will be $100.00. No order against any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation shall exceed $100,000.<br /><br />This solicitation will also act as an interim solution for prospective suppliers to submit catalogs for loading to the DOD EMALL system until this system is replaced by the Next Generation e-Commerce Solution (NGe-Com), which may become a "Federal Mall", or "FedMall" (note: this effort was previously referred to as "DOD EMALL 2.0"). It is anticipated that "FedMall" will be in its Full Deployment (FD) phase of development as early as the end of the third quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Given this aggressive timeline and the overall complexity of this effort, it is anticipated that there will be an integrated concurrent approach to development and deployment.<br /><br />The scope of this solicitation is limited to a subset of the DLA Managed Federal Supply Classes (FSCs; also referred to as Product Service Codes (PSCs)) and commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items (see FAR 2.101) matching the FSC descriptions. Descriptions of the required items (and excluded items), technical requirements, and performance requirements are outlined in the solicitation's Schedule of Supplies/Services and Statement of Work.<br /><br />All ordering shall be conducted electronically. DOD EMALL is the sole means by which orders will be issued against any contract awarded in response to this solicitation. Prospective suppliers will be required to submit an Electronic Commerce ("EC") Implementation Plan with their proposals. The EC Implementation Plan shall detail the contractor's computer hardware/software, thereby outlining the contractor's capability to receive electronic orders. At a minimum, all responding offerors must address how they intend on interfacing with the DOD EMALL System and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service's (DFAS's) Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system. <br /><br />Suppliers will also create a catalog using the Microsoft Excel workbook titled "DOD EMALL Catalog Loader Template and Instructions.xlsx" (see Attachment 2). The first spreadsheet (tab) in this workbook, entitled "Data Dictionary", provides descriptions and instructions for each of the catalog loader data elements, and identifies the ten (10) mandatory data elements that must be addressed for each item when creating a new catalog or issuing a catalog change. The second spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Requirements", provides the template that suppliers shall populate when submitting their catalog. The third spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Unit of Issue Codes", provides a listing of all acceptable Unit of Issue (UOI) codes used within the DOD EMALL system, which offerors are required to identify for each item in their catalog. The vendor shall also establish "Days After Receipt of Order (ARO)" for each item in its catalog. Vendors shall honor the posted delivery times in the catalog at the time of delivery order placement. Vendors will be required to make every effort to ship urgent or high priority orders within 24 hours after receipt of order, at no additional cost to the government, and meet all Preservation, Packaging, Packing, Labeling and Marking (PPPL&amp;M) requirements. All offered pricing within Supplier Catalogs shall be Fright on Board (FOB) Destination and must be inclusive of all shipping, handling, and transportation costs. Offerors may provide pricing and delivery terms based on customer location for Contiguous United States (CONUS) delivery; Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico (AHP) delivery; and Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) delivery. The DOD EMALL will provide the shipping addresses for each order placed through the DOD EMALL system. Shipment shall be made via traceable means.<br /><br />The terms of the contracts awarded as a result of the contemplated solicitation will have a Base Period and four (4) Option Periods (for a total of five (5) periods of performance). Each of these contract periods shall be for one year, unless otherwise specified in the award document. All contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation shall not exceed 60 months (should all option periods be exercised).<br /><br />The Government intends to award contracts without discussions on the basis of initial offers; however, it reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) if it is advantageous to the Government. The proposals will be reviewed in order of receipt and priority and compared to the checklist contained within the solicitation to ensure that offerors have submitted complete proposals. The Government intends to award to any responsible offeror who can comply with the supply and technical requirements at fair and reasonable prices. No award will be made to any offeror whose pricing is not considered fair and reasonable, or is uncompetitive with existing contractors providing the same supplies. An initial assessment of all proposals submitted prior to the closing date and time will be performed within a reasonable amount of time after offers are retrieved from the Business Opportunities Office to determine completeness. <br /><br />One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>Please note the Grantee has responded to the following 3 questions:<br /><br /><strong>1)</strong> We are a US entity that is a subsidiary of a [foreign] based parent company. For the determination of the award criteria the RFP states: "The qualified bidder will be expected to provide evidence of satisfactorily executing at least five (5) similar projects within the past 10 years". Can project experience from our parent company based out of the [foreign country] or other affiliates based out of other countries from the US be counted as credentials for consideration for the Award Criteria?<br /><br />

<DESC><strong><br />1. Request for Information (RFI) for Planning Purposes</strong>
<p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This RFI is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The resultant contract will require access to export controlled data and software in accordance with the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751, et seq.) or the Export Administrative Act of 1979, as amendment, (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.). The data and software will be provided in accordance with Department of Defense Directive 5230.25 enclosure 5. For prime and/or subcontractors under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) award will be dependent on the agency's determination that the contractor has adequate controls in place to ensure the proper protection of the export controlled data and software. This determination will not be made prospectively as this would require advance knowledge of proposal content not yet received. In accordance with sections 2-307 and 10-509 of the DoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), FOCI companies must include with their proposal either a copy of their Cognizant Security Agency (CSA) approved Technology Control Plan (TCP) or documentation showing the CSA has determined procedures already in place at the contractor's facility are adequate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is conducting market research to identify companies that may possess the capabilities to produce the kits described below and potentially deliver these kits on a compressed schedule. Companies with experience producing kits should assess their ability to produce the CMC/Wx Radar kits without a complete technical data package (TDP) and should identify what additional work would be required to acquire, assemble, and ship the kits to the designated delivery destination. Companies should address the reasonableness to meet the kit assembly and delivery schedule for each year, taking into account that a final, formal technical data package will not be available to the USG until March 2017. Identify which Lot years your company can reasonably meet with regard to quantity deliveries and timeliness based on the information provided in this RFI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the RFI/sources sought or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 31.205-18 -- Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs. Companies responding to this sources sought are advised that participation does not ensure involvement in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in the RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p><strong>2. Program Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Program Description</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The C-5 aircraft's primary mission is to provide strategic airlift in support of Mobility Air Force's peace and war time missions. The C-5 users are represented by the Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard. At this time there are no current or planned international operators of this weapons system.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Capability Required</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contractor will be responsible for procuring, building, and delivering CMC/WxR modification kits for up to 50 C-5M aircraft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Schedule.</strong> Contract award is scheduled to occur by 31 January 2017. The Government requires modification kits to support the installation schedule. Deliveries should begin as kits are completed and each lot must complete delivery within 12 months of the lot's start date:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lot 1, 7 kits delivered starting not later than 1 June 2017 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lot 2, 9 kits delivered starting not later than 1 June 2018<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lot 3, 15 kits delivered starting not later than 1 June 2019<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lot 4, 15 kits delivered starting not later than 1 June 2020<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lot 5, 4 kits delivered starting not later than 1 June 2021</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Procurement.</strong> Potential offerors are expected to set contracts or Technical Assistance Agreements with both the aircraft and component level Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The current OEMs are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Lockheed Martin Aero - Marietta, GA (Prime Original Equipment Manufacturer for Airframe)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Honeywell - Albuquerque, NM (Core Mission Computer)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Rockwell-Collins - Cedar Rapids, IA (Weather Radar)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Ballard Technology - Everett, WA (Video Display Unit)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Mega Industries - Gorham, ME (Waveguide)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the organic technical repair center for depot-level maintenance is Warner-Robins Air Logistics Complex (WR-ALC), Robins Air Force Base, Georgia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Kit Builds.</strong> Potential offerors are expected to build kits in accordance with Government-approved drawings. Formal technical data packages are not set for release until March 2017. The offeror should assume no parts (i.e. bench stock, work order residue, etc.) called out in the provisioning parts list are available at the installation site -- all items shall be provided as part of each individual kit. There are an estimated 375 pieces in the total provisioning parts list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Kit Deliveries.</strong> The final installation site for this effort has not been determined at this time. It is the offeror's responsibility to ship completed kits from the offeror's facilities to the installation location. For planning purposes, the Government will accept delivery at WR-ALC, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Security Requirements.</strong> Contractors will be required to have a SECRET clearance to gain access to Government and contractor facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Contract Specifications.</strong> The Government plans to use priced contract "options" by Lot year that best meet the needs of the Program measured in cost, schedule, and technical performance. Lot 1 kits are scheduled to be on contract as soon as January 2017. Expressed or implied warranties provided through the vendor should begin once components are installed on the aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Modification Description</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CMC/WxR modification includes replacing and/or installing system line replaceable units, incorporating a software load port at an existing load panel, and adding radio frequency (RF) cabling between the load port and the replacement&nbsp;WxR receiver/transmitter. In addition, the modification includes a set of replacement waveguides, structural components and hardware, and wiring and attaching hardware. The list of associated Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) and brief explanation is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Versatile Integrated Avionics (VIA) unit - Honeywell: form-fit-function replacement with improved internal processing modules and integrated Ethernet ports for software loading. Part Number: CP8527501-905.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Avionics Integrated Unit (AIU) - Honeywell: form-fit-function replacement with improved internal processing modules and integrated Ethernet ports for software loading. Part Number: CP8527470-905.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Radar Pedestal - Rockwell-Collins: attaches to the base plate and supports the antenna flat panel. The pedestal is the "moving" part of the radar system. Part Number: WMA-701X<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Antenna Flat Panel - Rockwell-Collins: attaches to the pedestal. Part Number: WFA-701X<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; WxR Receiver/Transmitter (RT) - Rockwell-Collins: the RT receives signals from the radar thru waveguides. Five (5) waveguide pieces will be assembled to make a single assembly during the modification. The waveguide will pass through existing holes in the aircraft structure. The RT mounts to the RT Tray. Part Number: WRT-2100.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; WxR RT Tray - Rockwell-Collins: the tray will be mounted approximated 12 inches to the left of the existing RT. Includes a fan and fan test button. Part Number: WMT-701X.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Video Display Unit (VDU) - Ballard Technology: two (2) VDUs will pass through video signals to up to eight (8) cockpit displays. Signals will be transmitted from the RT thru RF cabling. The VDUs are new components to the C-5. Part Number: 11-11020-04.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; WxR Control Panel - Rockwell-Collins: control panel is a swap out from the existing/legacy control panel. Part Number: WCP-701.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; UHF/Antenna Select Bunk PA Panel: manufactured by FTG Aerospace, Chatsworth, CA.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the VIA/AIU are separate LRUs but are interdependent and act as a single unit when installed. There are two each of these components installed on the aircraft.<br /><br /><strong>3. Company Response</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Sources Sought/RFI. The results of this effort will enable the Government to assess the feasibility of a potential set-aside for small business for this effort and identify interested vendors. It is advised that all respondents provide sufficiently detailed answers to the capability questions to allow the Government to determine if your company has the ability to provide installation kits to support the current modification schedule.</p>

The ECAT System allows DLA Troop Support (CONUS AND OCONUS) customers to review and compare contractor electronic catalogs with the ultimate goal of placing on-line orders to the contractor of their choice.</span></strong></p>
<p>DLA Troop Support military and other government customers are currently using the ECAT System to order medically related laboratory, dental and optical supplies and limited medical equipment.</p>
<p>This is the follow-on to our current standing solicitation number SPM2D1-07-R-0012 which closed on August 12, 2011. The objective of this solicitation is to award the next generation of ECAT contracts for Medical Equipment. This acquisition seeks to award multiple contracts to all "responsive", responsible offerors (both manufacturers and dealers). The solicitation requests contractors to provide their discounted price(s) from their commercial catalog(s) of various medical equipment items for ECAT. This solicitation will result in multiple long term contracts with a base term of 5 years. This solicitation will be standing for 5 years from the solicitation issuance date.</p>
<p>This acquisition seeks to award multiple IDIQ contracts. DLA Troop Support awards will be in accordance with the ECAT multi-award program complying with requirements of FAR 8.4, DFARS 208.405-70 and DLAD 8.4 to technically acceptable, responsible vendors (both manufacturers and dealers) offering Medical Equipment items at fair and reasonable prices. The solicitation requires contractors to offer their commercial products that complied with the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Medical Equipment is defined as that equipment used by medical professionals, technicians and laboratory personnel to perform a treatment, test or operation. We are soliciting for medical equipment, maintenance of medical equipment (with or without the equipment), and/or spare parts/repair parts of medical equipment (with or without the equipment). Along with these items, the following may be required: classroom training, repair parts, maintenance of the item(s) and installation when applicable, all consumable and non-consumable items used in conjunction with any and all medical equipment. Typically, but not always, the operation of medical equipment requires line power (120 or 220 VAC, 50 or 60 Hz), with some having back-up batteries. Some equipment relies solely on battery power.</p>
<p>We are soliciting for Contractors' entire medical equipment product lines. The medical equipment includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1. Defibrillators<br />2. Pulse oximeters<br />3. Aspirators<br />4. Ventilators<br />5. Examination tables/surgical tables<br />6. Repair parts <br />7. Dental systems/handpieces<br />8. Infusions pumps <br />9. Suction apparatus <br />10. Resuscitators<br />11. Patient monitors<br />12. Electrocardiographs<br />13. Analyzers/test equipment<br />14. Anesthesia apparatus<br />15. Medical furniture<br />16. Hospital beds/chairs/stretchers<br />17. Laboratory analyzers<br />18. Small portable ultrasound(s)<br />19. Litters<br />20. Lasers<br />21. Dental X-Rays<br />22. Sterilizers<br />23. Medical Refrigerators<br />24. Ophthalmic Equipment</p>
<p>Under this solicitation the following items are excluded: Ultrasounds (other than small portable), Diagnostic X-Ray (other than small portable and Dental X-Ray), Magnetic Resonance Imaging Systems, Nuclear Medicine, Computed Tomography, Magnetoencephalography, Pet Scanner, Cyclotron, Radiation Oncology , Lithotripsy and PACs.<br /><br />NOTE TO CONTRACTORS WITH EXISTING CONTRACTS UNDER SPM2D1-07-R-0012:</p>
<p>In an effort to avoid a gap in contract coverage, current contractors should in general submit a "new offer" as early as 9 months prior to the expiration of their existing contract. The government has the right to award a "new offer" contract before, at time of expiration, or after the expiration of the contractor's existing contract.</p>
<p>The standing solicitation is available via download from the DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/">https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/</a>.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for the vendor to provide the personnel, services, facilities, transportation and materials necessary to perform the analyses of non-oily wastewater. The product and services will be provided by Enviro-Chem Laboratories, Inc. of Sparks, MD. Services provided will allow measurement testing of treatment systems. The vendor NAICS code is 541380 and the business size is Small Business.
<p>The proposed purchase order is being solicited on a sole-source basis to Enviro-Chem Laboratories, Inc. The proposed action is for the procurement of analytical services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). The basis for restricting competition is for the following reasons: Enviro-Chem Laboratories, Inc. provides highly specialized services, it is likely that award to any other source would result in Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements for the required application. The NSWCCD intends to award a firm fixed-price purchase order to Enviro-Chem Laboratories, Inc. using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. <br /><br />Interested parties may identify their interest to this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement no later than&nbsp;13&nbsp;November 2015. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received by 5:00 pm EST on 11/13/2015 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquiries should be directed to Christopher Bezold at christopher.bezold@navy.mil .</p>

<DESC>This procurement was initially synopsized as contemplating that this would be awarded using full and open competition.  Upon further more research and information gathered after the initial synopsis, EPA has made the determination that only STERIS Corporation can perform the required maintenance services.  Further, EPA has determined that the award will be a single twelve month period.  It has been determined that the optional period in the initial synopsis is not in the governments best interest.

Therefore, EPA INTENDS TO NEGOTIATE ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with STERIS Corporation.  This is based upon the information gained that STERIS Corporation is the only factory-authorized suppliers of parts and maintenance services for the units to be maintained under the procurement. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.    Sources wishing to be considered by the agency MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice.  Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  EPA anticipates making an award by November 30, 2015. Submit your request in writing to Lisa Ryle at the address shown below or email at ryle.lisa@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

The new contract follows two pilot projects, the Essential Services North (ESN) contract and Essential Services South (ESS) cooperative agreement, in addition to a continuation of the ESS activity under the Syria Essential Services (SES) contract. The award will be managed by USAID under the Southern Syria Assistance Platform (SSAP) in Jordan, and implemented in close coordination with the Syria Transition Assistance Response Team (START) in Turkey.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</span><span style="text-indent: -0.5in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Symbol;">&middot;<span style="font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></span><strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-bidi; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-bidi; mso-bidi-theme-font: major-bidi;">Objective</span></strong></p>

Following this immediate assistance, or in communities under ongoing opposition influence, the offeror shall work through local councils to identify priority services and undertake interventions that restore critical essential services identified by the community and ultimately contribute to increased stability. The offeror shall then build on the outcomes and impacts of the rapid reaction and essential service restoration to support increased economic activities and livelihood opportunities.&nbsp; These basic efforts shall be supplemented by a robust analytical component and necessary technical assistance targeted to relevant governance structures, Syrian non-governmental organizations, and communities. USAID will work closely with the awardee to determine the appropriate application of resources from each of the four task areas throughout the contract period.<strong></strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">The offeror shall accomplish its objectives to stabilize and provide relief to Syrian communities through the provision of technical and material assistance, including engineering expertise, training, and cash grants to restore essential services and increase economic opportunities. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">Essential services include, but are not limited to water, electricity, public waste management, restoration of public buildings (e.g., schools and hospitals), agriculture (e.g., productivity and access to markets), and civil administration (e.g., provision of civil records).</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">A successful approach to all four task areas will ensure that activities undertaken by the offeror have the support of local governance structures and the broader community, provide innovative engineering design and support, and build the technical, financial, and administrative capacity of Syrian institutions to maintain and expand their ability to deliver critical services.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">The offeror must demonstrate concrete links among the four task areas, including the application of analytical efforts to design service restoration and rehabilitation of essential services, governance efforts by providing technical assistance to civil administration structures, and monitoring and evaluation of the stated objective. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">The essential services activities undertaken must serve to reinforce governance efforts while providing hands-on experience to councils, communities, and NGOs to take the lead in administrating services.

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization).
IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3). Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
695-16-1-133-0031	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER : N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT:
$15,108.00 base year
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
Justification and approval for a firm-fixed price base and 2 option year contract. PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. shall furnish all labor, transportation, parts, and expertise necessary to provide preventative maintenance and emergency (unscheduled) repair of the Clarus 500 Chromatograph and Clarus 500 Mass Spectrometer Turbo at the Hines VA Hospital.
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:  Vendor verification statement of sole source on file. Perkin Elmer is the OEM of Clarus 500 Gas Chromatograph S/N 650N5093003, and one (1) Clarus 500 Mass Spectrometer Turbo, S/N 615N5092201, located in Room F317-1 at the William Hines Jr VAMC. PerkinElmer does not certify third party technical service nor do they have any dealers or distributors selling parts.
4. REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES: PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. is the sole source for factory new or factory remanufactured parts, local service representation and factory trained/certified engineers to provide service and installation for all instrumentation manufactured and sold by PerkinElmer, Inc.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED: For PerkinElmer, there is a GSA contract however, per Sarah Enos; Contract Support Specialist for PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc., PerkinElmer does not have any services on their GSA Contract. After reviewing the SDVOSB/VOSB on the VIP page, this service is not available through a SDVOSB or VOSB. Due to the certainty based on market research that this type of service can only be fulfilled directly by the manufacturer. Posted intent to sole source
VA69D-15-Q-1337 to FBO on August 28, 2015. Upon response deadline, September 2, 2015, no other vendors responded.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. The contracting officer has determined that this request will proceed as sole source, FAR: 13.106-1 only one source.

In accordance with DRAFT VA Handbook 7815, non-capital leases less than 10,000 usable square feet (USF) or 100 parking spaces with a lease term not exceeding 10 years, may be procured by the local Lease Contracting Officer without Director, Real Property Service delegation. On December 14, 2014, the Director, Real Property Service issued a Delegation of Authority to the Director, Richard L.  Roudebush VAMC delegating any qualified Department of Veterans Affairs Contracting Officer (CO), who has the proper warrant level, to execute a lease of this magnitude. Currently the Indianapolis Medical Center leases a 13,425rsf residential facility - Blue Triangle Residence Hall, 725 N. Pennsylvania, Indianapolis, IN 46204 under eCMS Lease Number - VA583V101183R5830207. The expiration date of the current lease is 10 February 2018.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
On June 4, 2015, The Department of Veterans Affairs, Roudebush VAMC submitted a request, to the Director of Contracting, NCO 11, to lease 37,203 NUSF of existing space to house the Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (Dom). This includes space for the residence of Dom patients and the associated Mental Health Staff. This lease requirement is for a 10 year firm term period, with an anticipated commencing date of April 1, 2016. The estimated annual un-serviced cost of this lease is $887,964.00. The estimated annual un-serviced lease amount over the term is
$8,879,640.00. On June 17, 2015, a Sources Sought Notice, Number VA251-15-R-0427, was posted on FBO stating the following: "The Department of Veterans Affairs, Roudebush VAMC, located in Indianapolis, IN  desires to lease sufficient rentable square footage to yield 37,203 net usable square feet of existing space in Indianapolis, IN to be used as a Domiciliary. The mission of the Domiciliary is to provide an opportunity for Veterans to participate in a Residential, Rehabilitative Therapeutic Community. Veterans will be supported, by VA Staff, to achieve his/her optimal level of functioning and return to independent living. Specialized services are provided in a Therapeutic Residential Community and are based on Psychosocial Rehabilitation and recovery-oriented principles. The space must be a single tenant, class "A" type space. The offered space SHALL be currently zoned for domiciliary use or Special Use Zoning (SU 9). The space must be contiguous, existing space. On-site parking for 75 vehicles is required.
 
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:
The Statutory Authority for this action is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1).

(X) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
Upon receipt of the requirements for this lease procurement, consideration was given to the special usage of the space, and zoning requirements. Marion County, Indiana Zoning Authority was consulted in determining the required zoning for this type space. Marion County Zoning Authority stated that the zoning requirement for this type space is Special Use or SU 9. On June 17, 2015, a Sources Sought Notice, Number VA251-15-R-0427, was posted on FBO outlining the VA's requirements as follows: Offered space must be located within the stated delineated area and outside the 100 years flood plain, Offered space must provide 37,203 NUSF of existing single tenant class "A" contiguous space, must provide on-site parking for 75 vehicles, and must be currently zoned for domiciliary use, special use or SU 9. Seven (7) spaces were offered for consideration. The LCO conducted an initial review of the seven (7) spaces offered and rated each offered space either "Pass" or "Fail" in meeting the VA's requirements as stated in the Sources Sought Notice. A market survey was conducted by members of the procurement team and this survey resulted in identifying only one (1) potentially acceptable location. The market survey team determined that space offered by Thomas Burns located at 9045 East 59th Street should be solicited. Market research information was obtained also by contacting brokers, and realtors within the local area.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:
This lease procurement was requested by the Roudebush VAMC, Indianapolis, IN. Because of the uniqueness of the space usage as a domiciliary, Marion County, Indiana Zoning Authority was consulted in determining the required zoning for this type space. Marion County Zoning Authority provided the zoning requirements and the districts within Marion County that offered the type of zoning required for this type space usage. On June 17, 2015, a Sources Sought Notice, Number VA251-15-R-0427, was posted on FBO stating the following: "The Department of Veterans Affairs, Roudebush VAMC, located in Indianapolis, IN desires to lease sufficient rentable square footage to yield 37,203 net usable square feet of existing space in Indianapolis, IN to be used as a Domiciliary. The mission of the Domiciliary is to provide an opportunity for Veterans to participate in a Residential, Rehabilitative Therapeutic Community. Veterans will be supported, by VA Staff, to achieve his/her optimal level of functioning and return to independent living. Specialized services are provided in a Therapeutic Residential Community and are based on Psychosocial Rehabilitation and recovery-oriented principles. The space must be a single tenant, class "A" type space. The offered space SHALL be currently zoned for domiciliary use or Special Use Zoning (SU 9). The space must be contiguous, existing space. On-site parking for 75 vehicles is required. A lease for up to 10 years will be considered".  Seven (7) spaces were offered for consideration.  The LCO conducted an initial review of the offered spaces to confirm that each space met the requirements of the Sources Sought Notice.  During the initial review, it was determined by the LCO that only two (2) spaces met all the requirements of the FBO notice. Offered spaces were initially reviewed and rated either "Pass" or "Fail" using the following factors: a) Meets minimum SF requirement, b) can provide space in a single tenant space, c) Meets parking requirement, d) Located outside 100-years flood plain, e) Currently zoned for domiciliary use, special use or SU 9. The following is a listing of offered space received and initial ratings:

Name of Owner or Broker	Address of Property	Initial Rating
Chelsea Drinkard	3849 Richard St. Indianapolis, IN 46226	Failed
Chelsea Drinkard	1050 E Washington, Indianapolis, IN 46226	Failed

Thomas Cortese	5738 -5746 Wheeler Rd., Indianapolis, IN 46234	Passed
Thomas Burns	9045 E 59th St, Indianapolis, IN 46234	Passed
	
On July 7, 2015, a Market Survey was conducted by members of the procurement team.  During the Market Survey, it was determined, by the procurement team, that space located at 5738-5746 Wheeler Rd., Indianapolis, IN 46234, did not meet the requirements of the Sources Sought Notice and will not be solicited for the following reasons:  a) the space did not offer the required 37,203 NUSF of existing space; b) space offered consists of 2 separate existing buildings.  Each building offered approximately 13,000 SF of existing space, separated by vacant land that could be used for new construction, accounting for the remaining required SF.
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:
The anticipated cost is expected to be fair and reasonable. An Appraisal Report shall be obtained and used in determining the fair market rental rate. Historical data on previously awarded leases, in that area, will be considered. A minimum of three (3) quotes for the construction of the TI shall be provided by the offeror. A cost analysis of the offeror's proposed costs will also be performed.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:
On June 17, 2015, a Sources Sought Notice, Number VA251-15-R-0427, was posted on FBO.  The results of the market research generated the following offered space:

Name of Owner or Broker	Address of Property
Chelsea Drinkard	3849 Richard St. Indianapolis, IN 46226
Chelsea Drinkard	1050 E Washington, Indianapolis, IN 46226
Arthur Robertson	2828 Tobey Dr., Indianapolis, IN 46219
Arthur Robertson	2301 Churchman Rd, Indianapolis, IN 46203
Thomas Cortese	1910 S. Girl School Rd., Indianapolis, IN 46241
Thomas Cortese	5738 -5746 Wheeler Rd., Indianapolis, IN 46234
Thomas Burns	9045 E 59th St, Indianapolis, IN 46234

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:
Memo dated June 4, 2015, the Interim Director, Roudebush VAMC, requests permission to proceed, on an urgent and compelling basis in acquiring leased space to house the Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program (Dom), to include space for the residence of Dom patients and the associated Mental Health Staff. The Director further stated the following; a) the current Dom is situated in a building that is unable to provide a therapeutic location aligned with the goals of a Dom program, b) frequently occurring problems at current location include the presence of bed bugs, high crime, and inability of lessor to maintain a reasonable temperature, c) the medical center has no space available to provide housing, offices, treatment rooms, and group therapy rooms for this program.
Because of the urgent and compelling basis of this lease procurement request, as stated by Roudebush VAMC Interim Director, and then reported to VACO RPS as an emergency lease procurement, during
 
the establishment of the requirements, immediate consideration was given the need for proper zoning, and the time required for re-zoning and variances to be approved. Marion County Zoning Authority provided the type of zoning required and the districts within Marion County that offered the type
of zoning required for this real property lease procurement. Marion County Zoning Authority also stated that space re-zoning or variance approval process takes approximately 60 - 120 days, and that these requests are not always approved. However, the offered space located at 9045 East 59th Street is currently zoned and can be used for special use.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:
The following is a list of sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:

Name of Owner or Broker	Address of Property
Chelsea Drinkard	3849 Richard St. Indianapolis, IN 46226
Chelsea Drinkard	1050 E Washington, Indianapolis, IN 46226
Arthur Robertson	2828 Tobey Dr., Indianapolis, IN 46219
Arthur Robertson	2301 Churchman Rd, Indianapolis, IN 46203
Thomas Cortese	1910 S. Girl School Rd., Indianapolis, IN 46241
Thomas Cortese	5738 -5746 Wheeler Rd., Indianapolis, IN 46234
Thomas Burns	9045 E 59th St, Indianapolis, IN 46234

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required:
In order to overcome barriers to competition, we will continue to use brokers, realtors, owners, local newspaper advertisements, and FBO for all Lease procurements.
