<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate with Leapfrog Enterprises, Inc., 6401 Hollis Street, Suite 150, Emeryville, CA  94608, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302.1 to award a contract to develop an electronic talking book that combines pictures, audio and multi-layered content in an interactive medium to be utilized to teach Afghan women urgent lessons regarding their health and that of their children and families, regardless of their ability to read. The contractor must possess extensive knowledge of the unique culture, disease patterns, state of the country and its health systems in order to create this product.  The product must be culturally sensitive, contain accurate information and be appropriate to the situation in which Afghan women and their families live. The contractor must identify the economic and social barriers to the process of implementing this technology in the current clinical setting. The contractor will be responsible for the concept design, researching the material, developing visual and audio components of the product, translating the material into the two predominant local languages, Dari and Pashto, and then producing the books. Production of 20,000 copies must be completed with an initial installment in April 2004.  Leapfrog has immediately available people fluent in both languages who understand the health needs, cultural differences and current clinical settings of the Afghan people.  Leapfrog has produced a similar prototype specific to the Afghan people, currently has on staff personnel with the unique qualifications and expertise required and possesses the production facilities and abilities that would allow the project to be completed in time to meet the deadline. Any other contractor would have to: 1) have immediately available the critical personnel and required expertise, 2) provide a prototype for approval shortly after award and 3) be able to produce 20,000 copies of the approved product with an initial installment in April 2004. Therefore, the government believes that to award this contract to any contractor but Leapfrog would result in a significant increase in cost and an unacceptable delay in production. The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above. Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a cost estimate, production timeline with initial installment date no later than April 1, 2004, and statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirement as described above. No solicitation document is available. Capability statements should be submitted within 10 calendar days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above.

<DESC>This project is sponsored jointly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), hereafter referred to as the Government.  The purpose of this project as required by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NVCIA), P.L. 99-660, is to provide a single nationwide mechanism by which vaccine adverse events (VAEs) occurring after receipt of vaccines as specified in the NCVIA are collected and analyzed.  It is additionally intended to provide the same reporting mechanism for all other VAEs not specified by the NCVIA.  For all reports, the impetus for reporting is not a presumed causal relationship between the vaccination and the event, but may be based simply on factors such as the occurrence of the event temporally following vaccination and the lack of other obvious causes.  In addition, beginning in 1994, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) participates in the VAERS system by forwarding information to VAERS based on claims filed under the NCVIA.  Clinical experts with the VICP also review selected VAERS reports at the request of the Government, after personal identifying information has been removed from the VAERS reports.  The Contractor will be responsible for all the day-to-day aspects of VAERS operations, including 1) promoting reporting, 2) data collection and entry into a database using standard quality control and quality assurance measures, 3) follow-up of serious and selected other reports, 4) data security, integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality, 5) providing support for CDC and FDA researchers in conducting epidemiologic and other scientific studies of VAERS data, and 6) complete detailed up-to-date documentation for all business processes and IT systems.

It is anticipated that a cost-plus-award-fee contract will be made.  The performance period for the contract will be seven years.  This will be a full and open competition requirement.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  See Numbered Note 26.

Upon issuance, the RFP will be available on the Internet at www.eps.gov.  The date specified for receipt of offers will be approximately 30 days after the solicitation issue date. The solicitation issue date will be on or about March 19, 2004.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC intends to extend contract H-36080D to ELMCO Inc. for eight months for navigation engineering efforts in conducting extension, modification, and testing of Navigation Filter Integration Package (NFIP) for the NGLT Robust Integration Technology and Test (RITAT).  This contract was originally awarded on a sole source basis.	Competition is impractical for the following reasons: (1) Cost Savings -- Costs would be duplicated if another contractor not familiar with NFIP is hired to conduct extension, modification, and testing of NFIP. (2) On-time Delivery -- NFIP is scheduled to be completed before June 2004 in order to be ready for flight testing in RITAT package in a King Air airplane.  Without on-time completion of NFIP using the same contractor will result in delaying RITAT flight tests and increase costs to NASA. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 12, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<SOLNBR>N0002404R6308
<CONTACT>Carol Brown 202-781-4875
<DESC>Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a firm fixed price contract for 912 commercial body armor vests, 1,824 soft ballistic panel inserts, and 1,824 ceramic hard armor inserts to KDH Defense Systems, Inc., 239 Main Street, Suite 240, Johnstown, PA 15901. These body armor vests manufactured by KDH have been determined to be the only vests capable of meeting the functionality and specific mission requirements, including wear-ability, flexibility, a quick-release mechanism so that the armor can be jettisoned from the wearer to reduce the potential for drowning, and certified protection against NIJ 0101.04 Level III threats and 7.62mm x 39mm API threats. KDH vests have the following characteristics which fulfill these requirement: Quick-Release Mechanism utilizes a single wire for simplicity in activation; Quick-Release Mechanism single wire allows for efficient reassem bly; Quick-Release Mechanism can be re-assembled within 75 seconds or less; Quick-Release Mechanism is also utilized for fit adjustment; all moving parts of the Quick-Release are centrally located in the front panel; Quick-Release Mechanism has no exposed parts with the exception of the handle; and upon release of the Quick-Release the vest remains in no more than two sections. The hard armor ceramic plates offered by this vendor provide certified protection against NIJ 0101.04 Level III threats, military threats as specified for the Interceptor SAPI plates, and also the 7.62mm x 39mm API threats recently experienced in the combat theater. No other supplier provides this same protection in their ceramic plates. Ceramic plates are required for their reduced weight, which is also a requirement as a result of the specific mission environment. The vendor is also capable of meeting  an accelerated delivery schedule, to begin delivery 30 days after contract award, and make final delivery no later than 14 weeks after award. See Note 22.

<DESC>The National Park Service intends to award a sole-source contract to Lemons House Moving,. Inc., for the dismantling, moving, foundation construction, placement, reconstruction, and rehabilitation of 13 log and frame buildings in Grand Teton National Park.  This proposed action is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their written interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competetive proposals, however, all expressions of interest received within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competetive procurement. The work consists of furnishing equipment, materials and personnel to move 13 log and frame buildings from their present location within an environmentally sensitive setting to other locations within Grand Teton National Park. Buildings, aged 25-50 years,  are to be moved from a remote location, along narrow, confined roads to alternate locations within the Park.  Some buildings must be cut into sections or dismantled in order to fit the road prism.  The work is being completed in conjunction with the movement of other buildings presently owned by a private party and would require a high degree of co-ordination in order to complete movement and rehabilitation within a short time-frame of 3-4 summer months.       Contract evaluation factors being considered are: familiarity with the work site, technical capabilities and experience to work in environmentally sensitive locations, and demonstration of adequate personnel and equipment to complete project within limited timeframes. Any prospective Contractor must demonstrate completion of jobs of similar nature and show high quality of work consistent with historic character of setting and structures and sensitivity to environmental concerns.  The jobsite is located within Grand Teton National Park, Teton County, Wyoming.  Work is to be completed under NAISC Code 235990.  Estimated price range is between $600,000 and   $750,000.

The MACC III may include up to five (5) Indefinite Quantity contracts with firm fixed price task orders to be placed thereunder.  The contracts are for a base year and three one-year option periods.  A set maximum amount has been established for each year, which includes up to $35 million for the first year, up to $20 million for the second year, up to $25 million for the year, and up to $20 million for the fourth year.  The total amount for all task orders issued during the four year term, regardless of the number of contracts awarded, will not exceed $100,000,000.  Task orders issued under this contract will range from $3,000,000 to $20,000,000; however, smaller and larger dollar value projects may be considered.  Future task orders will be competed only among the up to five successful contractors.  Award of each future task order may be based on either Best Value to the Government or low price.  Future task orders may require multi-disciplined engineering and design services in all aspects of construction for new and renovation projects.  Environmental engineering services, including analysis of requirements, preparation of permit applications and design may also be required.  All key professional disciplines shall be registered.  The work contemplated under this procurement will include new construction, alterations, renovations, maintenance, repairs, and the ability to do design build projects, but fully designed projects may also be competed under these contracts.  Projects may include asbestos/lead based paint removal, demolition, proprietary items and options.

<DESC>General:
The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture, is seeking contractor(s) to provide services for the collection of rangeland data on selected sample sites (points) for the  National Resources Inventory (NRI), Rangeland Field Study in Montana.  The intent of the Agency is to solicit the most efficient and effective manner to complete the requirements of this inventory.   The performance period begins June 15, 2004 and ends September 30, 2004. The contract may include options for future years.

Background:
The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is mandated (through the Rural Development Act of 1972, the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977, and other supporting legislation) to assess the status, condition, and trends of soil, water, and related resources on the Nation’s non-Federal lands.  Resources inventory legislative authorities, NRCS policy, and responsibilities for conducting the NRI are contained in NRCS General Manual 290, Part 400.

Objective/Scope:
The objective of this solicitation is to acquire specified rangeland inventory data on two data points in each of about (240) 160-acre Primary Sample Units (PSU) (up to 480 total data points) located in several Montana counties. (4) performance groups (clusters) of about 60 PSUs each will be identified within general physiographic regions of Montana.  

General Rangeland Inventory Data Elements:
The following categories characterize general data collection needs:
 (a) GPS navigation to points and point position capture; (b) ownership; (c) land cover/use; (d) landscape and soils; (e) ecological site information; (f) rangeland health indicators; (g) noxious weeds and invasive/alien plants; (h) disturbance indicators; (i) conservation practices and resource concerns; (j) line point transects for cover composition; (k) line intercept transects for basal and canopy gaps; (l) cover density and height (Robel Pole); and (m) species composition by weight, production and Similarity Index (SI).

Data Collection:
Government Provided Equipment.  All data will be recorded in the field on GPS-based Computer Assisted Survey Instruments (CASI) preloaded with government designed and authorized software.

Workload and Logistics:  
It is anticipated that 2 persons will be required at each site to physically collect and enter data into the CASI.  It is estimated that one PSU (2 points) can be completed within 16 to 18 total staff hours.

Confidentiality Statement:  
Successful contractor(s) will be required to sign a confidential agreement under UNITED STATES CODE, Title 18, Section 1905; UNITED STATES CODE, Title7, Section 2276 and UNITED STATES CODE, Title 7, Section 2240 for non-disclosure of confidential information relative to data site locations and/or use of composite data. 

A solicitation for this effort will be issued on or about April 5, 2004.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, Michigan is seeking to procure an Engine Combustion Cycle Characterization and Analysis System. As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, a variety of new emissions regulations have been implemented for new heavy duty engines.  The 2007 Heavy Duty Engine Rule will require test systems that are integrated as sophisticated and adaptable emission measurement systems.  The EPA NVFEL has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems.  As part of this program, EPA has a  requirement for an  Engine Combustion Cycle Characterization and Analysis System to be installed in a new heavy duty engine test cell. For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, design/configuration, fabrication, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL (located in Ann Arbor, MI), installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation and training of EPA staff. The heavy duty engine test cell is being developed in order to test low-emission heavy-duty engines equipped with advanced exhaust emission control systems, in accordance with regulatory requirements.  The engines that will be tested will  typically be those designed for on-highway truck applications, or non-road applications, such as agricultural equipment.  The systems purchased under this requirement shall support a variety of configurable test procedures for investigatory and research purposes for engines ranging from 75 to 600 HP.  This shall include a wide array of internal combustion engines, including spark ignition and compression ignition, utilizing a variety of fuel types and fuel injection schemes including multiple injection events for a single combustion cycle, 2 or 4-cycle engines, HCCI, variable displacement, unequal firing intervals and engines with up to 12 cylinders. Major  Engine Combustion Cycle Characterization and Analysis System Configuration Requirements:   The System  shall be designed, manufactured and configured to measure, characterize and analyze engine combustion processes by measuring the engine cylinder pressure waveforms and crankshaft rotation signals.  The System shall be capable of acquiring, calculating, recording and displaying combustion data at sufficient speed to allow true real time functioning,  including the capability of real-time functioning as part of an engine control system. The System shall be of proven design, in widespread use in the engine testing industry.  The System shall utilize multiple real-time processors, or equivalent strategies, to achieve maximum computational throughput. The System shall include all hardware and software to provide a full array features and functionality.  The Engine Combustion Cycle Characterization and Analysis System  shall compute, log and display up to 100 combustion parameters in real-time for each cylinder, for contiguous combustion cycles.  "Real time" shall be taken to mean that all calculations for the current engine cycle are complete before the data acquisition for the next cycle is completed.  Post processing shall not be required to get combustion results, however a complete array of post processing functions shall be available to calculate and analyze parameters not selected at time of test.  The System shall record and store at least 64 megasamples ( 128 Mbytes) of raw and/or calculated combustion parameters for post test analysis.  The Engine Combustion Cycle Characterization and Analysis System shall have the ability to quantify knock on a cylinder-by-cylinder and cycle-by-cycle basis. Cylinder pressure signals shall be filtered to isolate the knock frequencies.  Intensity and peak value analysis shall be performed for each engine cycle. Simultaneous acquisition of standard combustion data shall allow for cycle-by-cycle correlation.  The System shall include a full set of display and analysis tools available through a clear, logical Graphical User Interface. The following options are also included in the procurement: (1) An option for up to two additional units, (2) An option for up to three "expansion kits" which will allow measurement of an extended number of cylinders, (3) An option for up to four additional pressure transducers with all associated cables, (4) An option for up to two units of additional charge amplification for at least four pressure transducers, with all associated cables, (5) An option for up to two additional crankshaft encoders with all associated cables, (6) An option for up to two additional encoder signal conditioners with all associated cables, (7) An option for up to two additional A/D IO modules of at least eight I/O channels per module with all associated cables, (8) An option for three additional training modules, and (9) An option for an Extended Warranty and Preventive Maintenance contract, renewable annually for up to 4 years from the date of acceptance.  This procurement will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria and will be competed using Full and Open Competition.  The solicitation should be issued around March 18, 2004 on the EPA website:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Research Triangle Park, NC, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Jack R. Edwards of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at North Carolina State University to develop continuum models for the transport of particulates of a specified size class. These models will solve equations for mass and momentum conservation of a particulate phase,  influenced by forces that affect the motion of particles. These include hydrodynamic drag, buoyancy, Saffmann lift forces, and  surface adhesion forces. The particulate transport routines be either integrated in tandem with the main flow equations or solved in a stand-along manner, subject to an inputted time-dependent velocity field.  Dr. Edwards previously provided computational simulation and modeling support for  experimental activities to understand the processes leading to particulate dispersal and re-suspension in confined environments. Now, EPA has identified the need to complete the additional tasks mentioned based on the results of the previous work. Specifically, Dr. Edwards will be required to: (1)  develop stand-alone and coupled algorithms for simulating the motion of a particulate phase in response to human induced motion, (2) develop models for simulating the decay of velocity fluctuations over long periods of time, and (3) validate the combined immersed-boundary/particulate transport  simulation capability.   This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA source research indicates Dr. Edwards is the only known contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary to complete this project. Since these tasks are a natural progression from previous work  completed, it would take considerable time for a new contractor to become familiar with the work already completed. The work is highly complex and complicated and any other contractor would require extensive and costly training to have the ability to deliver the services here required.  However,  any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such work. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before March 19, 2004 at 5:00 PM EST).  A determination  not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive  procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.   This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541720. Interested parties should submit their technical documentation, referencing RFQ-OH-04-00067, to Mr. Josh Bowers, as follows: via regular mail: U.S. EPA, Cincinnati  Procurement Operations Division, 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268, or via Express Mail/Hand Carry:  U.S. EPA, 4411 Montgomery Road, Suite 300, Norwood, OH 45212.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Chesapeake Research Review, Inc., Columbia, MD. 
Project Title:	Institutional Review Board for Intramural Research

 The purpose is for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to establish an Institution Review Board (IRB) review process for intramural research, secure an agency-wide Federal Wide Assurance (FWA), and provide at least one training/orientation session for agency staff, focusing first on intramural researchers.

The Office of Extramural Research, Education and Priority Populations (OEREP) has been tasked with coordinating the processes and procedures for intramural research review and for educating AHRQ staff about ethical research, research integrity/responsible research, and human subjects protections, and with coordinating responsibilities, processes, and procedures for review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) of intramural research.  Education and training are intended to assist program staff in understanding the requirements of human subjects protection, the process of submitting and obtaining IRB approval, and research integrity/responsible research conduct for Federally funded intramural research. Research protocol review must initially be conducted by an experienced independent review board as the Agency explores other procurement options and accumulates sufficient empirical evidence on the volume, flow and complexity of intramural research to consider internal versus external review options.  The proposed contractor is a professional services company that provides review of socio-behavioral research protocols and ethical review for projects where IRB review may not be required.

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the electrical distribution system and wastewater collection system at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: Installation: Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. System Descriptions: Electric and Wastewater.  Strategically located on the northern portion of the Island of Guam, Andersen AFB occupies 20,000 acres of land. Andersen AFB covers an area roughly 8 miles wide and 2-4 miles long (24.5squaremiles).  Andersen AFB has three major utility systems that are under review for potential privatization: the electrical distribution, potable water production and distribution, and wastewater collection utility systems. (The base does not have a natural gas distribution system.) The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the utility systems at Andersen AFB. Any numbers may be used for estimating only. The electrical distribution system at Andersen AFB is currently owned by the Air Force and operated and maintained by the Navy civilian personnel. Andersen AFB purchases its electric power requirements from the Navy and redistributes the electricity throughout the base. Andersen AFB’s electrical distribution utility system includes the following: 1 main substation, approximately 11.4 circuit miles of overhead primary distribution line, 20.6 circuit miles of underground primary distribution line, 15.0 circuit miles of overhead secondary distribution line, 12.4 circuit miles of underground secondary distribution line and 31,104 kVA of overhead and pad mounted transformers. The wastewater system on Andersen AFB collects and conveys on average 1.0 MGD of wastewater (sewage) to GWA’s system for treatment and disposal. The bases waste water collection system includes the following: 8 industrial grease traps, 17 oil water separators (OWS’s), approximately 255,000 linear feet (48.3 miles) of piping, ranging in size from 4-inches to 20-inches in diameter, 495 manholes, and 6 sewage lift stations (SLS’s) (5 with emergency generators). Andersen’s collection system includes CP, TP, ACP, RCP and CIP. It is predominantly a gravity flow system in which four main areas flow to the SLS, and ultimately discharges to the force main connected to GWA’s wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Andersen completed upgrading all the wastewater collection lines within the family housing areas during 2001; approximately 98,000 linear feet (38.4 percent of the total) of the wastewater collection system was replaced. See Note 26. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. Interested sources shall contact Bobby Jones at 703-767-2397 to be added to our bidder mailing list. A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL. The solicitation will be available on or after March 19, 2004 LINKURL: http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMPage.asp?pageid=246 LINKDESC: http://www.desc.dla.mil EMAILADD: Robert.E.Jones@dla.mil

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Laurie  Bagby, (601)631-7901
<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg District, has a requirement for seismic hazard analysis study at Enid Dam, near Enid in North Central Mississippi.  The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to solicit from URS Greiner, Inc., 1333 Broadwa y, Suite 800, Oakland, California, who is the only known responsible source that can meet Agency requirements. The scope of work includes the following:  Review the design earthquake parameters presently being utilized in the Earthquake Study of Enid Dam i n Mississippi to determine if they are still appropriate with present engineering practices.  These include earthquake acceleration time histories, magnitudes and durations.  The earthquake design parameters should be updated to reflect the present state-o f-the-art in seismology and the current knowledge of the seismic hazard in the New Madrid region.  Review all field and laboratory data including undisturbed samples, SPT, CPT, Geophysical Testing and Field Vane Shear Tests to characterize the soil conditi ons including stratification of material type, and soil strength of the embankment and foundation of Enid Dam considering previous studies of these materials.  The material type that exists in the foundation of the dam and is potentially liquefiable is a s ilty clay that meets the Chinese criteria for liquefaction of fine-grained soils. The nature and configuration of these materials are unique in the Mississippi alluvial valley.  Develop and/or update the presentation of this data including figures, plates and tables for final documentation of the field and laboratory data.  These figures, tables and plates will be utilized in the final Seismic Safety Study Report.  Based on previous studies and expertise of this contractor in this area of Mississippi, it wo uld take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to fulfill these requirements, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  This project is estimated to be below simplified acquisition threshold.  This notic e of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may submit a capability statement. This statement should include company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax number, email address and company product litera ture. All capability statements received by 2:00 PM, Central Standard Time, 15 March 2004 in response to this notice will be considered by the Government for the purpose of determining whether to initiate a competitive procurement. The Government reserves the right to process this procurement as a sole source action based on the responses received. Questions regarding this notice should be addressed to Laurie Bagby, e-mail Laurie.A.Bagby@MVK02.usace.army.mil or fax 601-631-7263  and/or Janice Butler e-mail Janice.I.Butler@MVK02.usace.army.mil .

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

On June 30, 2006, the Food and Drug Administration will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1906 Food and Drugs Act, legislation that established our nation's oldest federal consumer protection agency.  The agency wants to celebrate this historic milestone by promoting activities throughout the nation.  
 
In 2002, the agency contracted with a public relations firm to develop a theme and plan for commemorating FDA's 100th anniversary.  The theme is PROTECTING AND ADVANCING AMERICA’S HEALTH.  FDA envisions the implementation of a national public education program to recognize the scientific advances that have led to the safety and effectiveness of FDA regulated products.  As a result of this effort, the public consciousness of the FDA should be heightened so that both the consumer and policymakers see the agency as a pioneer and leader in the field of health protection and emerging scientific advances as we seek to recruit young scientists. 
 
The objective of this contract is to use a public relations firm to develop and implement in the next year a plan to use the media as the channel for educating and informing FDA's constituents and implement it over the three-year timeframe culminating with the 2006 centennial commemoration.   
 

 THE GOALS FOR THE FDA CENTENNIAL ARE AS FOLLOWS:
 
Goal -1     Use broadcast and other media to observe and celebrate FDA's first 100 years of contributions to America's public health and the world community and further FDA's mission to promote and protect the public health for future generations.
 
Goal -2     Use broadcast and other media to commemorate contributions of dedicated FDA employees, legislators, academicians, industry, advocacy groups and public health leaders who have supported the consumer protection mission of the Agency.
 
Goal -3     Use broadcast and other media to broaden public awareness of the considerable breath of the FDA's authorities and programs and instill a fuller appreciation of the Agency's impact on the public health and safety of our Nation.
 
Goal -4     Use broadcast and other media to stimulate interest and increase awareness of FDA regulatory science and public health initiatives through education.
 


The SPECIFIC TASKS are as follows: 
 
Task -3.1  Develop a the media plan and implementation time table for commemorating FDA's 100th anniversary of the 1906 Food and Drugs Act.  The media messages will convey the importance of FDA in consumer's lives and how the FDA plays a role in 25 cents of every dollar consumers spend. 
The plan must be presented in writing. This plan will be reviewed through the FDA Office of External Relations and approved prior to implementation of the tasks specified in this contract.
Task -3.2  The plan should include specific activities to be carried-out throughout the three-year timetable culminating in the 2006 centennial year.  The plan must include all FDA centers and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (headquarters and field).  For example, a list of inventive elements such as televised town hall meetings, a Smithsonian lecture/exhibit/traveling exhibit, or the development of high school and college curriculum. 
Develop a strategy for extending FDA coverage through the media partnerships that will be mutually beneficial to the news organization and the FDA.  Partnerships may include, but is not limited to, business and industry, academia, consumer organizations, health professional associations, disease oriented advocacy groups, and faith-based and community-based programs.  Examples of activities may include  FDA information in regular programming, periodic special programming with commentary from the Commissioner or other senior FDA officials, and/or weekly specials to highlight FDA issues that affects its constituents, website recognition of FDA's centennial, exhibits at meetings, and development of educational modules for school use.
Task -3.3  Define the roles and responsibilities and the parts they will play throughout the three-years of celebration for the Commissioner, Center Directors, field staff and FDA Alumni Association members as well as involvement at the Department level and perhaps Cabinet level. 
Task -3.4   The media plan will need to communicate with all levels of FDAs constituents by translating complex themes to messages that are direct and easily understood.  These messages should speak to consumers about issues that affect their lives and offer strong visual and human interest components using real life examples whenever feasible.  The messages must cover a broad spectrum of constituents such as other governmental and public health entities, national institutions such as the Smithsonian Institute and the National Academy of Sciences, and media such as television (PBS), radio (NPR) and print (newspapers and magazines) to promote the centennial. 
As part of this effort, it will be important to have performance goals and measurements to be able to document the increase in constituent recognition and knowledge of FDA and its mission and accomplishments.    
THE DELIVERY SCHEDULE:  All items shall be delivered on a F.O.B. destination basis in accordance with terms of the three-year timetable.  Each deliverable will be submitted with six copies to the Contract Officer and the Project Officer on a quarterly basis with an up-dated timeline.

<DESC>Statement of Work For Audio Visual System for Mobile Command Post SECTION I DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES GENERAL DESCRIPTION:  The Regional Contracting Office, Far East intends to procure an Audio/Visual (A/V) system for a mobile command post (CP) consisting of either five or six nodes.  Each of the nodes of the CP will have an audio/visual presentation system that can be viewed by any of the watch standers in that node.  This audiovisual presentation system will become the core enabler for shared situational awareness within each node and within the entire command post.  Contractors may submit proposals for a five or six node system, or both.  If proposals are submitted for both sizes, each proposal must be separate and complete. 1.1	SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor must provide all the equipment and the personnel necessary to train Government personnel in setting up and operating  a complete audio visual display system that meets the following requirements: 1.1.1	Must be rugged enough to deploy in a military field environment. 1.1.1.1	Because the system will be used to support a mobile CP, the entire system must be contained in deployment cases to guard against breakage.  The system must be designed to facilitate rapid set up and rapid break down. 1.1.1.2	The system must be optimized for the following configuration of five or six:  A main combat operations center (COC) in a J series Drash shelter (34.2’ x 35’) and 4 or 5 CP nodes in 6XB Drash shelters (35.3’ x 15.3’).  The smaller CP nodes will be connected to the main COC with a standard Drash connector kit.  Although the system must be optimized for this configuration, it must be capable of being set up in a variety of facilities to include tents and buildings.  The design must allow for at least 4 00’ of separation from one node of the CP to the next.     1.1.1.3	To facilitate changing configurations, video-switching technology that uses CAT5 cable is preferred. 1.1.1.4	The video equipment should be commercial off the shelf (COTS) and standardized for sparing and ease of replacement and maintenance. 1.1.2	Video Teleconference (VTC) equipment integration 1.1.2.1	Each node of the CP must be capable of integrating existing (Government furnished) VTC systems.  1.1.2.2	VTC audio and video must be capable of presentation in all nodes of the CP. 1.1.3	Video switching and presentation  1.1.3.1	The number of displays and presentations must support the following CP nodes:  COC/Fires (collocated in the drash configuration, but may be separated in other configurations), G2, LNO, CG, OPT.  To allow for flexibility of design within funding constraints, the exact number of displ ays and presentations will not be specified in this SOW; however, the desired configuration is as follows: ·	COC – 1 large video wall capable of 4 presentation elements ·	Fires – Optimum: the same configuration as the COC.  Adequate:  Do not provide a separate video wall, instead,  combine this node with the COC.    ·	G2 – 1 small video wall capable of 2 presentation elements ·	LNO – 1 small video wall capable of 2 presentation elements ·	CG – 1 small video wall capable of 2 presentation elements ·	OPT  – 1 small video wall capable of 2 presentation elements 1.1.3.2	Rear screen projectors are preferred over other forms of displays. 1.1.3.3	The display systems must be designed to support continuous (24 hours/day) operations. 1.1.3.4	The system must be able to display multiple video sources from a variety of hardware and software applications.  Hardware input must incl ude computers, DVD/VHS, VTC and television.  Output must include the video wall in each node of the CP and additional government furnished monitors.   1.1.3.5	The video system must provide the capability to display four-in-one display capability (video controller capability). 1.1.3.6	Multiple computers (Government furnished) in each node of the CP must be capable of presentation on any screen within that node and in any other node of the CP. 1.1.3.7	Video switching, from one source to another, must be accomplished by an operator without having to physically reconfigure any part of the system.  This switching will normally be accomplished by a watch officer and not by a technician.  Therefore, the system must be simple to operate and easily learned. 1.1.3.8	Video switching can be accomplished from a front panel or from a Graphical User Interface (GUI), so long as it meets th e previous requirement. 1.1.3.9	Each node of the CP must be capable of controlling its own video switching. 1.1.4	Audio integration. 1.1.4.1	In addition to the integration of VTC audio, the system must allow for audio from Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP), telephone and single channel radio to be played in any node of the CP. 1.1.4.2	Each node of the CP must have a mutable microphone and a loud-speaker system capable of providing intelligible audio throughout all nodes of the CP. 1.1.4.3	Audio microphone(s) must be line connect or Infra-red (IR). 1.1.5	Commonality with other users The system must be designed to be interoperable with USFK systems.

Synopsis 
This is a Corrected Pre-Solicitation Notice.  Please note that the solicitation number has been corrected to N62472-03-R-0101 and that the estimated date for the Request For Proposal package availability has been changed to December 29, 2003.  Two Phase design/build Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AS UNRESTRICTED. The acquisition is being conducted using full and open competition (unrestricted) and is therefore subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.219-4, “Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hubzone Small Business Concerns”. This solicitation will result in award of the Multiple Award Construction Contract - III (MACC-III).  The MACC III may include up to five (5) Indefinite Quantity contracts with firm fixed price task orders to be placed thereunder.  The contracts are for a base year and three one-year option periods.  A set maximum amount has been established for each year, which includes up to $35 million for the first year, up to $20 million for the second year, up to $25 million for the year, and up to $20 million for the fourth year.  The total amount for all task orders issued during the four year term, regardless of the number of contracts awarded, will not exceed $100,000,000.  Task orders issued under this contract will range from $3,000,000 to $20,000,000; however, smaller and larger dollar value projects may be considered.  Future task orders will be competed only among the up to five successful contractors.  Award of each future task order may be based on either Best Value to the Government or low price.  Future task orders may require multi-disciplined engineering and design services in all aspects of construction for new and renovation projects.  Environmental engineering services, including analysis of requirements, preparation of permit applications and design may also be required.  All key professional disciplines shall be registered.  The work contemplated under this procurement will include new construction, alterations, renovations, maintenance, repairs, and the ability to do design build projects, but fully designed projects may also be competed under these contracts.  Projects may include asbestos/lead based paint removal, demolition, proprietary items and options. A significant number of design-build or performance based task orders may be placed under the resultant contracts.  The work under the MACC-III contracts will be concentrated in, but not limited to, Engineering Field Activity Northeast’s 10 state area of responsibility, which includes Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware.   It is intended to award up to five (5) separate Indefinite Quantity contracts encompassing a base period of 365 calendar days and three one year options which may be exercised by the Government during which separate task orders for projects will be placed.  The Government reserves the right to award up to five contracts under this solicitation or to award only one contract covering only the seed project identified under the solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification sidered to be the most advantageous to the Government as a result of a Best Value evaluation with price and technical evaluation factors being approximately equal in importance.  Two-phase design-build Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  The evaluation factors under Phase-One may include the following:  1) Relevant Past Performance; 2) Management Approach; 3) Technical Experience, Expertise, and Qualifications, 4) Commitment to Small Business Concerns, and 5) Safety Record.  Offerors will be required to provide information for both their construction team, as well as their design team under these factors.

Synopsis 
This is a Corrected Pre-Solicitation Notice.  Two Phase design/build Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AS UNRESTRICTED. The acquisition is being conducted using full and open competition (unrestricted) and is therefore subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.219-4, “Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hubzone Small Business Concerns”. This solicitation will result in award of the Multiple Award Construction Contract - III (MACC-III).  The MACC III may include up to five (5) Indefinite Quantity contracts with firm fixed price task orders to be placed thereunder.  The contracts are for a base year and three one-year option periods.  A set maximum amount for all task orders to be issued has been established for each year, which includes up to $35 million for the first year, up to $20 million for the second year, up to $25 million for the third year, and up to $20 million for the fourth year.  The total amount for all task orders issued during the four year term, regardless of the number of contracts awarded, will not exceed $100,000,000.  Task orders issued under this contract will range from $3,000,000 to $20,000,000; however, smaller and larger dollar value projects may be considered.  Future task orders will be competed only among the successful contractors.  Award of each future task order may be based on either Best Value to the Government or low price.  Future task orders may require multi-disciplined engineering and design services in all aspects of construction for new and renovation projects.  Environmental engineering services, including analysis of requirements, preparation of permit applications and design may also be required.  All key professional disciplines shall be registered.  The work contemplated under this procurement will include new construction, alterations, renovations, maintenance, repairs, and design-build projects, but fully designed projects may also be competed under these contracts.  Projects may include asbestos/lead based paint removal, demolition, proprietary items and options. A significant number of design-build or performance based task orders may be placed under the resultant contracts.  The work under the MACC-III contracts will be concentrated in, but not limited to, Engineering Field Activity Northeast’s 10 state area of responsibility, which includes Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware.   It is intended to award up to five (5) separate Indefinite Quantity contracts encompassing a base period of 365 calendar days and three one year options which may be exercised by the Government during which separate task orders for projects will be placed.

To support this research the BLS is seeking medical insurance claims data that contains the diagnosis, the treatment, the out-of-pocket costs, and the insurance reimbursement for individual medical services provided to insurance policyholders.  

Companies that possess such data and are willing to provide a sample for research evaluation purposes should respond in writing as follows:  (1) Provide a description of the data that would be made available,  (2) State the circumstances under which the company would allow the BLS to sample the data. (If a written agreement is required, provide a copy.)  (3) State the cost for providing the data samples.    Responses must reference this solicitation number and state the company name, address, phone number, and the name of a contact person.  Responses by fax or e-mail are encouraged, and should be sent to the designated point of contact (below).  Responses that are sent by mail should be addressed to the designated contact at the following address:  Bureau of Labor Statistics, PSB Room 1830, 2 Massachusetts Avenue, NE, Washington, DC  20212.  All responses must be received by March 18, 2004.

<SUBJECT>W -- Rental of Storage Trailer
<DESC>The Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, DET Philadelphia, proposes the rental of storage trailer space for the Naval District Washington (NDW), Facilities Management Department, on a sole-source, urgent basis to Allstate rentals.  Currently NDW is storing 173 cubicles in 11 Allstate 40 ft Trailers located at Anacostia Naval Station using a NAVSEA Contract.  These trailers were loaded with NDW furniture in a quick turnaround requirement requested by Homland Security @ the NDW Nebraska Ave Complex.  Allstate was hired by NAVSEA to remove and store systems furniture for use at Washington Navy Yard for 30 days.  It has been determined that it would not be cost effective to move the furniture from the existing Allstate trailers into other trailers for storage.  Additionally, the NAVSEA contract with Allstate  expires on 30 March.  NDW Central Area Public Works will need a contractual vehicle in place with Allstate to meet furniture storage and movement of trailers requirement by 30 March, so it is of an urgent nature that continuity of services is maintained by Allstate.

<SUBJECT>S -- Worldwide Personal Protective Services - Draft RFP - comments from industry
<DESC>This is a draft RFP being posted to get comment from industry. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The U.S. Department of State intends to procure Worldwide Personal Protective Services to plan, organize, train, deploy and operate contractor protective service details for the protection of high level U.S. and foreign government officials. All logistic support for the teams may be required by the task order.  In certain circumstances contractors may be required to recruit, evaluate, and train local/third-country foreign nationals for security operations overseas.  It may also require trained protective security personnel for special domestic security situations.  A TOP SECRET facility clearance will be required prior to award of a contract.  A DRAFT copy of the performance based Statement of Work and other portions of the RFP are attached to this synopsis.  The Department anticipates two or three IDIQ awards with task orders competed between the awardees.  It is anticipated that the task orders will be firm fixed price.  At least one yet to be determined task order will be competed at time of contract award.  Contract type is based on the belief that while the work being performed is risky, the business proposal is not.  The attached RFP is not complete but a draft for comment.  Quality Assurance and incentive plans have not been written yet and we welcome comments from industry in these areas.  ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  In accordance with FAR 15.201, this DRAFT RFP is an "exchange with industry before receipt of proposals".  The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality services at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.  There is no FAR requirement for a reply to the questions or comments received from posting a draft RFP.  The Department may choose to answer the questions received but there is no duty to do so.  The Draft RFP may be amended based on feedback provided by industry if warranted. The final RFP will be released on or about March 30, 2004. It is anticipated that there will be a down-select based on technical experience on contracts of similar size with those most qualified providing full proposals with pricing on at least one task order that may be awarded without discussions.  The closing date for the receipt of offers will be 30 days after issuance of the RFP.  Questions or comments on our anticipated methods and on the draft sections of the RFP should be submitted by email only to the contracting officer, Raymond Bouford, BoufordRW@state.gov, no later than March 19, 2004.

Conference Registration - Registration is open to industry groups, trade associations, defense suppliers, customers and Congressional staffers. Register early so that we can ensure a space for you. Choose one of the three ways to register:

On an annual basis, DSCP buys $10.4 billion worth of food, clothing, textiles, medicines, medical equipments, general and industrial supplies and services for Americas warfighters worldwide.

The morning session will consist of presentations by representatives from DSCP who’ll be discussing current and anticipated shortfalls in domestic availability. The afternoon will consist of Commodity break-out (General and Industrial; Subsistence; Medical; Clothing and Textiles) sessions. It’s during these sessions where you’ll be asked to brainstorm innovative ideas to improve domestic sourcing for the various commodities that DSCP buys for America’s heroes.

<SUBJECT>--FY05 DoD JSTO-CBD MCBDRP Supplement to the Broad Agency Announcement 02-1. Pretreatments and medical countermeasures to chemical and biological threats, medical diagnostics and emerging threats.
<DESC>Fiscal Year 2005 (FY05) Department of Defense (DoD)Joint Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JSTO-CBD)Medical Chemical and Biological Defense Research Program (MCBDRP)Supplement to the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 02 -1. The JSTO-CBD, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, is soliciting proposals for participation in an extramural research program.  All extramural efforts must be able to integrate with intramural MCBDRP research efforts conducted by the Department of Defense  (DoD).  Thus, collaborative efforts with a DoD lab is strongly encouraged.  The contract period of performance will be one to two years.  The total amount of funds available for this program is $5 M. The awards are expected to be less than or equal to $1M  each (inclusive of direct and indirect costs).  The funding provided is in Budget Activity 2 (BA2 or Applied Research) and Budget Activity 3 (BA3 or Advanced Technology Development). In general, these funds will be directed at pretreatments and medical co untermeasures to chemical and biological threats, medical diagnostics and emerging threats.  Proposals are being solicited from educational institutions, nonprofit organizations and private industry. Research Proposal Topics: The JSTO-CBD is seeking propos als for research in a variety of areas including: 1.  Pretreatments:  Proposals are being solicited in the areas of human response to vaccination against biothreat agent antigens (e.g., epitope mapping studies). 2. Diagnostic Technology: a.  Proposals are being solicited in the areas of diagnostic platform development and integration and identification of novel host response and agent-specific markers (proteomics and genomics). b.  Proposals are being solicited for novel analytic procedures for chemical war fare agent detection/diagnosis (e.g., acetylcholinesterase) and definitive analytical procedures.3.  Medical Countermeasures (Therapeutics): a.  Proposals are being solicited in the areas of development and testing of fully human monoclonal antibodies agai nst biothreat agents. b.  Proposals are being solicited for broad spectrum treatment for chemical threat agents. 4. Emerging Threats: Proposals are being solicited in the areas of genetically engineered treats, particularly high through-put analysis of gen omic sequences for rapid analysis of biothreat agent genomes. Application Materials and Procedures: Proposals will be assessed for balance with ongoing DoD research. Investigators are expected to survey the peer-reviewed literature to support their proposa ls to avoid duplication of previous research efforts, including those previously supported by the DoD and/or its investigators.  An additional source of previously accomplished research supported by the DoD can be found on the Defense Technical Information  Center web site at http://www.dtic.mil using the Science and Technical Documents Search. It is anticipated that no individual award will be more than $1M (inclusive of direct and indirect costs), with a maximum period of performance of 2 years.  Reasonabl eness of budget for the proposed research is a component of the peer review evaluation process. Proposals:  Proposals must be received by 2:00 p.m. on April 8, 2004 to be eligible for consideration.  The proposal template and instructions for completion ar e available in the USAMRMC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 02-1 on the Internet at http://www.usamraa.army.mil and can be submitted on a CD/DVD in PDF or Microsoft Office format and mailed to US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, DTRACB05 ATTN:  M CMR-AAA, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD  21704-5014.  The CD/DVD must be labeled with the PIs name, phone no., email address and the organizations name, in case the disk is unreadable. Proposal Evaluation and Selection: The proposal evaluation crite ria listed below are specific to this announcement and take precedence over any evaluation criteria that are listed in BAA 02-1.  The Joint Science and Technolo gy Office for Chemical and Biological Defense will use a two-tiered review process for proposal evaluation, which consists of a scientific peer review and a programmatic review.  The two tiers are fundamentally different. 1.  The first tier is a scientific  peer review of proposals against established criteria for determination of scientific merit.  These reviews provide unbiased, expert advice on the scientific and technical merit of proposals, based upon the following review criteria:  - research strategy and objectives, - impact, - PI and key personnel qualifications, - facilities, - budget. The peer review summary statement is a product of scientific peer review.  Each statement includes the investigator s structured, technical abstract, the peer review s core, and an evaluation of the project as assessed by the peer reviewers according to the above evaluation criteria.  Summary statements are forwarded to the next stage of the review process, the programmatic review.  2.  The second tier of review, the pro grammatic review, is conducted by a team of military scientists, researchers and other federal agency representatives. Panel members use the peer review summary statements to make funding recommendations. Programmatic review uses the following four criteri a to make their recommendations: - peer review recommendations, - relevance of proposed research to military programs, - programmatic priorities, - portfolio balance. Scientifically sound proposals that best fulfill the above criteria and most effectively address the unique focus and goals of the CBDP will be recommended for funding.  Proposal Compliance: Failure to adhere to deadlines specified within this supplement may result in proposal rejection. Contact RAD4@det.amedd.army.mil for additional technical  information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number DJBCOB0002-4 is being issued as a small business set-aside request for quotation (RFQ).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)code for this acquisition is 541990.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Central Office Business Office intends to secure a fixed price requirements contract, for a base year and four option years.  Orders will be placed for the performance of tasks.
Background: In January 2003, an Executive Staff decision approved a pilot project(IACP)for Federal offenders with impulsive-aggressive disorders.  The IACP was conceptualized as consisting of four distinct processes, namely: Screening, Assessment, Treatment and Evaluation.  United States Penitentiary, Pollock, Louisiana was selected as the pilot site. 
The BOP is seeking a qualified individual to develop a system of screening and voluntary treatment for impulsive-aggressive disorders for inmates at USP Pollock.   The pilot entails that the contractor: 1. Screen - The identification process will include establishing specific criterion gleaned through documentation review (e.g., Admission and Orientations Screening information and Pre-sentence Investigations) and interviews with Psychology, correctional staff and inmates.  2. Assessment - Develop a classification system for accurately describing aggressive and violent acts of the Federal offender, both before and during incarceration.  The assessment classification tool or protocol would assess whether the individual inmate exhibits the Impulsive-Aggressive cluster of behaviors, including neurophysiological aspects of violent criminal behavior targeted by this pilot program.  3. Treatment - The contractor will be expected to design various treatment interventions to include psycho educational, cognitive-behavioral group, individual instruction / attention, neurofeedback, and when appropriate, consultation with a psychiatrist or neurologist and expose inmates to these interventions who agree to participate in the study.  Participants will complete the IACP when they have met their treatment goals, including at least 12 months without a 100 or 200 series incident report and at least six months without any incident reports.  4. Evaluation - An evaluation plan for such treatment needs to be established and executed.  Services provided by the contractor in this regard may include initial evaluation design, data collection, to include offender interviews, data entry, data analysis, and report writing.  The pilot will be evaluated by comparing incident reports and frequency of disciplinary transfers for inmates pre-IACP, IACP, and post-IACP using a within subject design.  It may also be possible to employ a between subjects design by including impulsive-aggressive non participants as a control group.  Perpetual evaluation will be conducted at USP Pollock, and the design will evolve through time given the allowances or constraints that are likely to emerge throughout the research process.  Finally, the contractor will collaboratively develop, with the Psychology Services Branch, a program evaluation design for the pilot which will address the questions of (1) whether it is possible to develop a reliable screening and assessment processes to identify inmates with impulsive-aggressive disorders, the IACP target population and (2) whether the IACP proved to be an effective treatment and management tool.  The contractor will also, provide technical assistance and training in the following areas: statistical analysis of data, scoring protocol for the classification of violent acts, data collection and management procedures, program implementation and treatment protocols.
Evaluation Criteria: Technical - the contractor must hold a Ph.D. from an accredited Psychology Program and have an established record of collaborative research in at least one correctional setting with the identified population of impulsive-aggressive offenders, must have a thorough working knowledge of impulsive-aggressive behaviors and the neurology and psychology behind such behaviors, have an understanding of correctional protocol, be familiar with mental health record keeping systems used in the field of correctional Psychology, have experience diagnosing and assessing impulsive-aggressive disorders and must have a thorough grounding in research design and statistical analyses.  He or she should have the ability to present pilot results to a variety of BOP staff.  Past Performance - submit information concerning previous projects completed in the field of Impulsive-Aggressive behavior, including: duration of project, number of staff directly involved, points of contact, including telephone number and any papers/articles written about Impulsive-Aggressive behavior.  
Delivery Schedule: The contractor will provide services for the duration of the pilot from IACP implementation to completion - which is expected to be approximately five years.  The contractor must reside within a 500 mile radius of USP Pollock, Alabama.  A session will be the equivalent of one hour, not to exceed thirty sessions per week.  Estimated session durations: Screening 40 sessions; Assessment 56 sessions; Treatment 160 sessions; Evaluation 160 sessions, total of 666 estimated sessions.  This estimate is not a representation that the estimated quantity will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.  Due to the nature of the correctional setting, delays in performance of work may be expected. Such delays may include but are not limited to inclement weather, electrical or mechanical problems, or other security matters.  When contract employees report to the institution but are unable to perform services due to such delays, the contractor will be paid for one (1) session.  However, if the institution requests that the contractor remain at the institution for eventual performance, the contractor shall be paid for such sessions.  Data gathering will be conducted during normal weekday business hours at USP Pollock.  Non site dependent tasks can be completed at the contractors primary place of business with proper confidentiality and security of pilot documents, to be approved by Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR).  Travel associated with this project for presentations and/or training of BOP staff will be reimbursed on an as-needed basis.  Government Furnished Equipment:  The government will be providing standard assessment instruments and mental health tools for use with the research participants.  Note: This contract does not constitute an employer/employee relationship.  The contractor acknowledges that a urinalysis test is required with a negative result being required.  The contractor acknowledges that he/she must pass all required security checks and clearances necessary to work in a Federal correctional facility.

ADDED.  13.  2 AUDIO STATIONS ARE REQUIRED.
Garmin Avionics was selected for the following safety reasons:
The Garmin Avionics system enhances the safety of passengers and crew by allowing the display of information within easy sight of the pilots. Presently, the navigation, communication and Art Traffic Control selectors and information are placed to the center and rear of the cockpit. This forces the pilots to have to turn around and situate their heads in such a way that normally leads to vertigo or loss of spatial awareness. This loss of awareness has been a contributing factor in aircraft mishaps. This will enhance the safety of the passengers and crew by relocating the navigation, Radio communications and Air Traffic control transponder from the lower console between the pilots to the instrument panel. This will allow the pilots to operate their navigation and communications radios without having to look away to change frequencies.
The Garmin system has a color-moving map with detailed and high quality definition of man made obstacles, terrain features and Air Traffic control designated airspace. This display allows for continuous situational awareness. This feature is very important since our mission profile takes us from high-density large airports to small remote unfamiliar airfields within the same flight.
The Garmin system was selected due to the fact that it is the only one of its type and size that will provide all systems to be relocated to the instrument panel due to the lack of available space to accommodate additional systems.
The Garmin system combines GPS navigation, VHF communication, VHF navigation and color moving map into one digital unit.
Equipment removed from the aircraft will be returned to US Government (USASOC Flight Detachment.)
