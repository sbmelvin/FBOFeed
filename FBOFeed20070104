<DESC>Kona Forest Unit of Hakalau Forest NWR Clear a corridor for boundary/internal fences at the Kona Forest Unit. The corridor to be cleared and fenced includes the whole Kona Forest Unit (5,300 acres; 2,145 ha).  The unit supports a variety of native rainforest and dryland natural communities that vary in terms of soil type, moisture regime, and degree of past disturbance.  A mix of nonnative and native forest occurs in the lowest elevations (2,000' - 3,500').  Native ohia dominated rainforest is found in the middle elevations (3,500 - 4,500'), ohia-koa mesic forest occurs in upper areas (4,500 - 5,500'), and some dryland mamane-sandlewood natural community in the highest elevations (5,500 - 6,000').  This area has been used for approximately 100 years as a cattle/logging area.  These activities have modified the habitat from dense forest with natural understory to large ohia with little to no understory in areas.  Feral ungulates (cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, goats and donkeys) will be removed and excluded from these units to assist the Refuge with its mission to protect and recover habitat for endangered forest flora and fauna. The purpose of the Task Order is to clear a corridor for the construction a cattle/pig proof fence along the boundary of the entire unit (5,300 acres) and at two internal crosspoints to create three feral ungulate management units of approximately 1,546 acres, 1,851 acres and 1,908 acres.  Total length of completed fences will be about 88,293 feet.  The length of the refuge boundary is as follows, north boundary is 26,722 ft, the south boundary is 25,524 ft, the east boundary is 9,835 ft and the west boundary is 7,926 ft.  The lengths of the internal fences are, upper (east) internal fence is 9,757 ft and the lower (west) is 8,529 ft.  The fence lines may be cleared to a maximum of 15' wide and smoothed with a bulldozer as determined through the NEPA process.

<DESC>A) Overview

The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) requires contract personnel to support the Test, Evaluation & Quality (TE&Q) organization by performing a variety of Quality Assurance (QA) related functions in support of Technology Acquisition Management (TAM) and other Engineering.  The services required deal primarily with experienced technical and management specialists who are capable of implementing field acceptance testing of mail processing equipment and performing quality audits.

Currently TE&Q uses approximately 110 contract persons in several labor categories, funded by over 30 different financial accounts, and it is anticipated that these figures will remain viable for the duration of the initial contract term.  However, the USPS may increase or decrease the number of contract personnel at any time, and there is no guaranteed minimum number of contract employees that must be maintained.

Approximately 15% of all contract employees are domiciled at the Engineering offices in Merrifield, VA or some specific supplier’s facility.  Of all the contract employees approximately 90% travel extensively throughout the United States.  Some assignments may require less or more than 40 hours per week.  A five-day workweek is not contemplated for most assignments.  No minimum workweek is guaranteed.  At the option of the USPS, a minimum of four (4) hours may be provided for Nonresident contract person on a case by case basis when traveling to a Postal site for a field test that is unexpectedly cancelled, rescheduled or postponed.

The supplier must be able to perform recruiting, managing, invoicing, and reporting tasks as a minimum.  Training shall be provided as necessary by the supplier in order to meet and maintain personnel requirements.  Certain equipment and supplies must also be provided and maintained as specified in this SOW and subsequent Task Orders.

B)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available technical staffing and management services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process, Reverse Auction or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities. The USPS may make one or more awards to support this activity.

C)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to provide an innovative and commercially available technical and management services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

<CONTACT>Brian Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-713-3405 x116, Fax 301-713-1024, Email brian.j.brown@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS), Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) seeks sources and information on how GIS shapefile or image based flood forecast showing flood extent could be brought to the general public in an efficient manner.  

Traditionally, NWS provides forecasts of river stages on our Nation?s rivers and streams in textual format, or with graphics showing river heights versus time (hydrographs).  To improve services to the people of the United States of America, NOAA/ NWS, Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD) and River Forecast Centers (RFCs) have developed prototype flood forecast maps using geoprocessing software to produce GIS shapefiles or images.  The shapefiles or images display an expected flood extent based on forecast water surface profiles as simulated by the NWS hydraulic model FLDWAV.  Deterministic or probabilistic based flood forecast files can be produced every 6 hours on a daily basis, several times per day.  The spatial extent of the shapefiles/images focuses on certain portions along selected rivers within the United States of America and its Territories where hydraulic modeling has been developed and the appropriate detailed topographic data is available.

Submissions shall address one or several of the following salient topics:

1) Express a business interest in creating, storing and/or distributing flood forecast shapefiles/images and/or in using flood forecast shapefiles/images.

2) Provide (technical) information and sources regarding creation, storage and/or distribution of flood forecast shapefiles/images and/or on potential uses of flood forecast shapefiles/images.

3) Provide information on options for:
a) Nature of the shapefiles/images delivered by the Government, whether it should be in interim or final display formats including whether the images should be pre-generated and stored or generated on the fly.
b) Whether or not the Government should provide shapefiles/images to a third party who would then distribute to the public.
c) Estimated scale and costs

4) Interest in collaborations with NWS to publish flood forecast shapefiles/images and/or to use flood forecast shapefiles/images.

Vendors who believe they can meet one or some of the requirements are requested to submit in writing a response demonstrating that they can meet the Government's requirements.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed (technical) information and other (technical) literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  Written responses must be received by February 28, 2007.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), Division of Extramural Research Activities (DERA), has a requirement for The Catheter Fabrication Laboratory (CFL), for services for gold plating of polyimide tubes. This requirement is under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 332813 and the Size  Standard is 500 employees which are applicable for this requirement. The requirement is a small business set-aside. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.

The tubes will be provided by the government for service.  Once the tubes have been plated, the tubes will be used to allow transmission of Radio Frequency (RF) current. This is an essential feature  in producing active guidewires under Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).   

The government?s required delivery date is January 31, 2007.

The government requires a company that is willing to devote the time and effort for a small order. The type of polyimide tubing is Thermoset and is not co-extruded with other plastic nor is it impregnated for better lubricity.  The coat needs to stand a 15-cm curvature of the radius without breaking apart from the polyimide tube.  An additional challenge lies in the thickness of the coating. Eight (8) microns are required for efficient transmission of RF due to the ?skin effect.?  RF current is conducted only within eight (8) microns from the outer surface, providing minimum resistance and attenuation of the signal.  However, an eight (8)- micron coating has a tendency to crack. Successful implementation of this project will provide a greater variety in guidewire design.

Proposals are due January 18, 2007 by 8:30 a.m. local time. The award will be made based on the lowest priced  technically  acceptable quote meeting the Government?s requirements.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors.  Therefore, the initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later is determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers, waive informalities, and minor irregularities in offers received.  The offeror?s proposal?s must include, an itemized price lists of charges, complete description of services, complete address for invoice payment and purchase order delivery, prompted payment discount terms,  the Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and certification of business size of the company.  The offeror must also register in the Government?s Contractor Registry System. Note: www.ccr.gov.  

The proposal must reference ?Solicitation number? NHLBI-PB-(HL)2007-049-DDC.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which if timely received shall be considered by the agency.  Proposals must be submitted in writing to the National,  Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042,  Bethesda, MD 20892-7902,  Attention: Deborah Coulter. Fax quotations will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement to purchase 6 Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) readers and 1000 compatible RFID tags on a sole source basis from RF SAW, Inc. This purchase is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, acquisition of supplies and services determined to be reasonably available from only one source. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: RF SAW Inc. is the leading Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) manufacturer and the only vendor uniquely positioned to provide NASA with SAW Tags, Focused Antennas and Readers as an integrated system along with engineering services to support their hardware. The use of proprietary physics in their Radio Wave Technology cannot be duplicated by other companies. The Specifications for RFID Hardware Purchase are: READER:  Reader shall be a portable/handheld unit.  Reader shall be battery operated.  Reader shall be compatible with Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) RFID tags.  Reader shall be capable of successfully reading tags enclosed within a NOMEX packing container at distances up to 3 feet.  Reader shall be capable of reading up to 25 tags attached to items contained within a single NOMEX container in 2 minutes with a 95% success rate.  Reader shall utilize an antennae configuration that is capable of being polarized in 4 directions (45 degree separation) in a sequential order during reading operations.  Reader shall provide a serial (RS-232, 9-pin, male) interface to an external device for transfer of tag information obtained during read operations.  Reader shall be capable of continuous operation for at least 1 hour without battery change-out.  Reader shall not have any exposed circuitry.  Reader output power shall not exceed 1mW. TAGS:  Tags shall be based on SAW technology.  Tags shall provide a minimum 64-bit response.  Tags shall be of the “delayed-response” type.  Tags shall be in 3 different configurations:  Adhesive backed, flexible, “peel & stick” application tags (620 required)  Adhesive backed “hot glue” application tags (360 required)  “Luggage label” tie-on tags (20 required)  Tags shall not have any sharp edges capable of damaging clothing or injuring crew.  Tags shall provide for error correction and collision avoidance. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Per FAR 19.502-2(a), this acquisition is set aside for small business concerns, unless the contracting officer determines there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing (email is preferred) to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 16, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has a requirement to house a population of approximately 7000 low security, non-US citizens, primarily Mexican sentenced male inmates in an existing secure correctional institution or institutions procured from state or local governments or private sources located in the continental United States.  Faith Based and Community Organizations have an equal right to submit competitive proposals for any resulting contract(s).  The approximately 7000 inmates are presently located in West Texas.  This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small sized companies.  The BOP will fulfill this requirement through multiple awards and anticipates that each facility or complex of facilities will house approximately 900-3000 inmates.  The proposed facility(ies) shall be an institution or complex of institutions in the same locality to accommodate a minimum of 900 beds to a maximum of 3,000 beds.  Offerors are not prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates at the institutions(s).  If the proposed institution(s) houses a mixed population of BOP and non-BOP inmates, offers will be evaluated to determine the soundness and effectiveness in managing and operating the shared institution(s).  Institutions proposed shall meet BOP standards as set forth in the resulting contract.  The facility(ies) proposed must be located in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oklahoma, or Texas.  Expansion or renovation of existing institutions will only be considered if completed within 120 calendar days after contract award and may not exceed 20% of the existing square footage proposed.  Any such expansion or renovation must not interfere with or delay the arrival of inmates as required by the resulting solicitation/contract.  Offerors shall demonstrate the ability to provide all personnel, equipment, materials, supplies and services necessary for the management and operation of a secure correctional institution.  The BOP intends to award a firm fixed-price type contract with award-fee incentives.  The contract will have a potential term of 10 years consisting of one four-year base period and three two-year option periods.  Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based statement of work based on American Correctional Association/Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions with a contractor management emphasis on quality control.  The offeror awarded the contract must be ready to accept inmates 120 days after contract award at a rate specified in the resulting contract.  The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued.  Past Performance and experience will be significant factors in the evaluation of offers.  Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government.  Information will be requested from offerors regarding past environmental activities and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located.  Prior to contract award, environmental documentation and other related information will be required in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  The BOP anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about 4/04/06 with an estimated response date of 6/03/06.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.  The solicitation will be available on or after 4/04/06 and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunity website http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to provide services in support of the Digital-to-Analog Converter Box Coupon Program authorized by section 3005 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The Coupon Program provides for distribution and redemption of coupons that consumers may apply toward the purchase of digital-to-analog converter boxes. The converter boxes will enable consumers to watch over-the-air television broadcasts on analog televisions once television stations cease analog broadcasting on February 17, 2009, as required by law. The services required cover three broad functional areas: (1) consumer education and communications, (2) systems processing (e.g., determine consumer eligibility, coupon distribution and activation, and certify retailers and provide training materials), and (3) financial processing (e.g., administer the coupon authorization for redemption, and retailer payment process, and perform independent auditing). 

NTIA plans to award a single contract for an end-to-end solution and execution of the Coupon Program that encompasses all three functional areas.  The Coupon Program components require expertise across a variety of fields.  NTIA encourages potential Offerors to include expertise from small businesses as well as large businesses to provide the best mix of resources to enable NTIA to execute the Coupon Program efficiently and effectively.

NTIA expects to issue an RFP on or about January 26, 2007. If circumstances permit, a draft RFP will be issued prior to that time. NTIA expects to host a Bidder's Conference after RFP release.  Details will be provided on NTIA website as they are finalized.  NTIA anticipates an approximate 27-month contract performance period with several major milestones mandated by law. For further information, call Diane Trice at (301) 713-0838 ext 102, email diane.trice@noaa.gov.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is responsible for administering two national disability programs, Title II Social Security Disability Insurance and Title XVI Supplemental Security Income.  On March 31, 2006, the SSA published a final rule in the Federal Register (Vo. 71, No. 62, March 31, 2006, pp. 16423-16462) amending the administrative review process for applications for benefits that are based on whether you are disabled under Title II of the Social Security Act (the Act) or applications for supplemental security income (SSI) payments that are based on whether you are disabled or blind under Title XVI of the Act.  To improve the accuracy, consistency, and timeliness of decision-making throughout the disability determination process, the final rule establishes SSA's new Disability Service Improvement (DSI) process.  


SSA has begun to roll out the new DSI process implemented on August 1, 2006 for applicants who reside in the states located in the Boston region (Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, & Rhode Island).  Most disability claims are initially processed through a network of local Social Security field offices and State agencies (usually called disability determination services or DDSs). Until recently, subsequent appeals of unfavorable determinations were decided by the DDSs reconsiderations and subsequently by SSA Administrative Law Judges and the SSA Appeals Council.  As part of the new DSI process, claimants who are initially denied disability benefits by the DDS may appeal the denial to a Federal Reviewing Official (FedRO) and eventually to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). ALJ decisions will be reviewed by a Decision Review Board (DRB) before the individual can file an appeal with the federal court. 


During their review of the claim, either the FedRO or ALJ may decide that additional evidence is necessary in order to decide whether the individual is disabled.  Updated medical evidence from the claimant's own sources may be needed before a new decision can be made.  Additionally, the FedRO and/or ALJ may require that the individual undergo consultative examinations (CE) and/or tests in order to make a new decision on the claim.  


The final rules describing the new disability review process explain that SSA's Office of Medical and Vocational Expertise (OMVE) will arrange for CEs that are requested by FedROs and ALJs.  Therefore, SSA is seeking to contract with networks of physicians who can provide these CEs, tests and reports to SSA for applicants who reside in the Boston region and who are appealing their claims for disability. 


See SSA's DSI website for additional information on the new DSI process:  http://www.socialsecurity.gov/disability-new-approach/.  In addition, for information purposes ONLY, potential offerors are directed to SSA's Request for Information, reference number SSA-OAG-CE-Boston, entitled, "Consultative Examinations (Boston Region) Request for Information," posted to FedBizOpps on December 5, 2006 at:  http://www.fbo.gov/servlet/Solicitation/R/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/Reference-Number-SSA-OAG-CE-Boston.  The RFI includes a DRAFT Statement of Work, DRAFT List of Exams and Background Information. 


SSA anticipates that this competition will result in the award of one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) with provisions for the issuance of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders.     The term of the BPA(s) will be for five years.         


This acquisition will be conducted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.     This is an unrestricted requirement where proposals from all responsible sources will be considered by the Agency.  Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov).  Potential Offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps site for release of this solicitation, amendments and all other documents relative to this solicitation.  Requests for paper copies will not be honored.  Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR)  https://www.bpn.gov/CCR/scripts/index.html database prior to award of any contract or BPA.  SSA anticipates release of the solicitation (SSA-RFP-07-1022) within the week of January 8, 2007 with responses due within thirty (30) calendar days after date of issuance unless otherwise amended.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  All questions must be submitted in writing via e-mail to bridget.hamel@ssa.gov.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  E-mail communications shall include company name, address, point of contact, e-mail address, phone and fax numbers.


The Interested Vendors List (IVL) has been enabled for this solicitation.  Vendors are encouraged to register their interest in this solicitation.  Using the IVL will:     1) Provide interested parties with automatic notice of solicitation amendments; 2) Provide information to the Contract Specialist; and 3) Enable the Contract Specialist to publish a listing of the interested vendors through FedBizOpps to facilitate vendor collaboration for subcontracting opportunities, etc.  No other listing of interested vendors will be created or be available for release.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The required equipment will interface with existing MTS system currently in use at Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC). The need to maintain the testing hardware readiness is imperative to meet the customer require ment. To incorporate unproven hardware into the system could jeopardize the readiness of the testing hardware.  Incorporating equipment from another vendor will also require training to operate and support the new equipment. The continuing use of the MTS e quipment allows a seamless upgrade that will more quickly move RTTC to the leading edge of servo-hydraulically actuated testing. MTS is the only known vendor that can meet RTTC requirements. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be ful ly considered by the agency.

<DESC>USACE, Vicksburg Consolidated Contracting Office proposes to issue a sole source award to ALFAB, Inc., PO Box 311327, Enterprise, AL, 36331-1327. The purpose of the award is for the vendor to provide the Rapid Parking Ramp Extension (RPRE) Project wi th 3,888 square feet of AM2 aluminum landing mat necessary to perform a variety of subgrade sensitivity tests in an experimental test section located at the ERDC, Vicksburg, MS, site. The AM2 landing mat required for the RPRE project is of modification fiv e and is currently deployed worldwide for military operations. The test requires the AM2 landing mat to be constructed to current specifications and is identical to that currently being used for military operations. Upcoming tests will use identical AM2 la nding mat over a stronger subgrade in order to determine increased performance. ALFAB, Inc. has been identified as the only vendor in the United States producing AM2 aluminum landing mat for the Department of Defense. This fact, coupled with the need for i dentical landing mat to make direct comparison of performance gains with subgrade strength increases makes ALFAB, Inc. the sole supplier for this project.  A firm-fixed price award will be made utilizing the Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Any other responsible source able to provide the supplies is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 5 days after its publication. This is not a request for q uotations and there is no solicitation available at this time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

A) Overview

The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) requires contract personnel to support the Test, Evaluation & Quality (TE&Q) organization by performing a variety of Quality Assurance (QA) related functions in support of Technology Acquisition Management (TAM) and other Engineering.  The services required deal primarily with experienced technical and management specialists who are capable of implementing field acceptance testing of mail processing equipment and performing quality audits.

Currently TE&Q uses approximately 110 contract persons in several labor categories, funded by over 30 different financial accounts, and it is anticipated that these figures will remain viable for the duration of the initial contract term.  However, the USPS may increase or decrease the number of contract personnel at any time, and there is no guaranteed minimum number of contract employees that must be maintained.

Approximately 15% of all contract employees are domiciled at the Engineering offices in Merrifield, VA or some specific supplier’s facility.  Of all the contract employees approximately 90% travel extensively throughout the United States.  Some assignments may require less or more than 40 hours per week.  A five-day workweek is not contemplated for most assignments.  No minimum workweek is guaranteed.  At the option of the USPS, a minimum of four (4) hours may be provided for Nonresident contract person on a case by case basis when traveling to a Postal site for a field test that is unexpectedly cancelled, rescheduled or postponed.

The supplier must be able to perform recruiting, managing, invoicing, and reporting tasks as a minimum.  Training shall be provided as necessary by the supplier in order to meet and maintain personnel requirements.  Certain equipment and supplies must also be provided and maintained as specified in this SOW and subsequent Task Orders.

B)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available technical staffing and management services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process, Reverse Auction or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities. The USPS may make one or more awards to support this activity.

C)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to provide an innovative and commercially available technical and management services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

D)  Notification to Selected Suppliers

Description This is a Sources Sought Notice only.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.   This is a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS). The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation will be  issued on or about 01 May 2007, will include a draft  Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A best value source selection will be considered as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the nine AFSSS field stations located in Glennville GA, Hawkinsville GA, Hollandale MS, Lewisville AR, San Diego CA, Truth or Consequences NM, Wetumpa AL, Maricopa AZ, and Archer City, TX.  The AFSSS has been identified as a critical defense system and, therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis.  Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor?s personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war.  The AFSSS stations are remotely located on a constant path across the southern United States from Georgia to California and consist of six receiver and three transmitter stations.  Energy emitted from the transmitter stations forms a fixed position, fan shaped beam very narrow in the north-south direction and extends across the continental United States in the east-west direction.  One or more of the receiver stations receives energy reflected from satellites penetrating this beam.  AFSSS stations provide satellite metric data to the Dahlgren Computational Center.  The subsequent contract will include a projected ninety-day phase-in period (1 Jul 2008-30 Sep 2008).  The Government  anticipates contract performance period could be greater than 5 years.  Contract type has not yet been determined; however, the current contract type is Firm Fixed Price with a cost reimbursable logistics CLIN.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 517910.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.  This synopsis also contains the following clause:  5352.201-9101 Ombudsman.  As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen: A7K, 150 Vandenberg St, Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, fax 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil . Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.                                              (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.              (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. (End of clause)

<DESC>Thw Solicitation package is now available.  To recieve a copy of the solicitation package please provide a completed and signed "Document Security Notice to Prospective Bidders/Offerors Form" to Noel Willette at noel.willette@gsa.gov. 

A preproposal conference will be scheduled in the near future.  A notice with the details of the conference will be issued.


GS-03P-07-DX-C-0008 General Services Administration (GSA) intends to procure a firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for a pavement repair project at the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Cheatham Annex in Williamsburg, VA.   It is GSA's intent to solicit this requirement through Full and Open Competition, utilizing Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Source Selection procedures.  The LPTA method, FAR 15.101-2, has been determined by the GSA Project Team to be in the best interest of the Government.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 238990.  The resultant contract will be a firm fixed price contract.

The work includes but is not limited to the milling and/or removal of existing deteriorated asphalt roadways, driveways, and concrete pavement as well as associated site work to correct drainage problems, and installation of new paving.  The work shall be accomplished in a single phase.  The approximate duration of the contract is six (6) months, which will include one base item and have four options. FAR Clause 52.217-7, Option for Increased Quantity - Separately Priced Line Item may be included in this acquisition. The contract will also include the clause titled "Evaluation of Options" (FAR 52.217-5) except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interest.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The estimated cost for this construction project is between $1,000,000.00 ? $5,000,000.00.

For this procurement the GSA Project Team shall evaluate all properly received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-2, ?Lowest price technically acceptable source selection process?.  As defined in FAR 15.101-2 (a) the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. FAR 15.101-1 (b) (1) states that the evaluation factors and significant sub factors that establish the requirements of acceptability shall be set forth in the solicitation. The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factors as requirements for acceptability; Factor 1) Firm shall list a minimum of five (5) projects completed in the past five(5) years of a similar scope of work that have a total contract value of at least $1,000,000.00. Submit a description of the project in no more than (2) paragraphs. Factor 2) Firm shall submit superintendent's resume demonstrating that he/she has 5 years of experience as a superintendent. 
Since the Contracting Officer has elected to utilize past performance as an evaluation factor the procedures detailed in FAR 15.305, ?Proposal evaluation?, shall be followed.  All proposals received shall be evaluated for acceptability but shall not be ranked using non-cost/price factors.

The RFP is scheduled to be available on or about November 24, 2006.  The subject solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified Building Information (SBU).  For reasons of security and before release of SBU information, the requestor must complete and sign the attached "Document Security Notice to Prospective Bidders/Offerors".  All prime contractors interested in submitting a proposal shall submit via e-mail a completed document security form.   As indicated, the form shall be filled out with the proper information including a photocopy of a valid business license, DUNS number, and IRS tax ID number.  This information shall be emailed back to Melinda M. Richardson at melinda.richardson@gsa.gov.  

Once the solicitation is available and the Security Form is received and verified, direction will be provided as to where the RFP, including plans and specifications, will be available. A Pre-proposal conference will be established in the near future.  Time, date and location will be provided in the solicitation.  To insure that you receive all information regarding this solicitation, please register to receive updates at www.fedbizopps.gov, follow the procedures for notification registration.

Request for Construction Documents 
GS-03P-07-DX-C-0008

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.   SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.


REASONABLE CARE:
 
1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and


(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding
hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically
destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The contractor shall develop an automated CPA system for USTRANSCOM, Command, Control, Communications and Computer Systems Directorate (TCJ6), the CPA program at Scott AFB, IL.  The contractor shall provide business process analysis, software development, documentation, and support.  This contract will allow USTRANSCOM to begin fulfilling its mission to automate for the customs and border clearance process.
The general scope of the contract is to provide functional analysis support, system/software engineering, and software application support required for the development of new functional capabilities and the expansion of existing capabilities currently available on two prototype software applications.  The CPA program goal is to satisfy customs clearance requirements for all DOD shipments around the world with a single Automated Data Processing (ADP) system.  Currently there are two prototype applications operating, one in Germany and one in Korea.  The contractor shall create a single system that has the existing prototypes capabilities, identified requirements, and implementation for each of the 18 countries.  The CPA system shall provide a series of flexible alternatives for creating and transferring customs clearance information for multiple countries.  It shall provide a seamless system for creating, populating and transmitting customs and related shipping documentation, while maintaining continuous visibility of the customs/border clearance process.  Additionally, the CPA system shall provide metrics that will allow USTRANSCOM, regional Combatant Commands, Services and Defense Agencies the means to identify problem areas in documentation, shipment processing and policy guidance.
The end state of the CPA program will provide DOD the capability to provide electronic files in a format agreeable to the individual host nation foreign countries that can be used to identify DOD shipments for customs clearance purposes and will provide the necessary data to allow those shipments duty-free entry as provide for by the specific Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) for each individual country.  The CPA system shall strive to meet the above goal for the following countries:  Republic of Korea, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, Spain, Bahrain, Kuwait, Canada, Afghanistan, Bosnia/Herzegovina, Diego Garcia, Iceland, Iraq, Netherlands, Turkey, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.  The CPA system shall provided electronic files that will be used to generate customs clearance documentation in an electronic format.  The formats and language shall vary by destination host country to satisfy its requirements.  The system shall push clearance information to US customs clearance officers, foreign customs authorities and commercial and military carriers as required by the operating environment in the host country.  In those cases where shipments arrive in the host country without advance data, the system shall provide the capability to produce customs clearance documentation using data input by the carrier and/or consignee.  For those countries that cannot participate in full automation, the system shall provide the host nation with printed forms as required.  In addition, the system shall provide status, conduct surveillance, and measure performance.

<DESC>Purpose of Modification is to add an additional Point of Contact. SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY for Blue Force Communications Interference Mitigation Capability for Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems. BACKGROUND:  Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems are currently being used in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) efforts.  CREW systems are being utilized by soldiers from all branches of the United States Military to defeat the increasing Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) threats while performing their duties in Theater.  However, CREW systems, when transmitting, interferes with co-located and nearby Blue Force Communications (BF COMMS) systems.  The level of interference is severe enough to cause the loss of all communications.  In addition, BF COMMS systems, when transmitting, interfere with the CREW system to the extent that the CREW systems become ineffective.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to identify technically mature systems, Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, that could potentially satisfy the compatibility/interoperability betwee!  n existing and future ground CREW and BF COMMS systems.  OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS: It is expected that compatibility systems will make it possible for Military forces to operate any CREW system effectively while simultaneously operating BF COMMS in the same vehicle and adjacent vehicles. BF COMMS consist of numerous systems in dismounted and mounted configurations based on common radio transceivers (RT).  Some of the more common RTs / applicable configurations /  waveform or system names are:  RT-1694D / AN/PRC-150, AN/VRC-104(V) / (Harris) HF ALE; RT-1796 / AN/PRC-117F, AN/VRC-103V1 / (Harris) TACSAT, SINCGARS, Have-Quick, VHF/UHF LOS; RT-1523(V) / AN/PRC-119(V), AN/VRC-87,88,89,90,91,92(V) / (ITT GD) SINCGARS; RT-1672 / AN/PSC-5 / SPITFIRE; RT-1672C / AN/PSC-5C / SHADOWFIRE; RT-1672D / AN/PSC-5D / (Raytheon) MBMMR, TACSAT, SINCGARS, Have-Quick, VHF/UHF LOS; RT-1720 / EPLRS; AN/PRC-148(V) / (Thales) MBITR, JEM, SINCGARS, Have-Quick, VHF/UHF LOS;  Blue Force Tracking (BFT) Systems; Movement Tracking System (MTS); and Global Positioni!  ng Systems (GPS) PLGR and DAGR.  This survey is intended to specifically investigate technically mature systems that are able to be mounted in various military and civilian vehicles.   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: These general, unclassified system requirements are applicable: A) Size:  no larger than 11” x 11” x 3”	 B) Weight:  no heavier than 5 pounds C) Compatible with multiple Communication Systems D) Compatible with 2.0 and newer CREW Systems E) 24 VDC Tactical vehicle power and 12 VDC Civilian vehicle power F) Must have a minimum operational reliability of 90% with a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of a minimum of 800 hours. RESPONSES: Responses may be submitted in hard copy or electronic format. However, only vendors possessing a minimum of a Secret Clearance may submit a response to this RFI.  Responses must include:  A)Industry Point of Contact (PoC) for Technical and Contractual issues to include name, position, telephone, and email. B)Page Limit for Responses is 25 pages. C)Complete System Description. D)Overall capabilities of the system as compared against the above general requirements. E)Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the system with justification. F)Additional detailed information regarding the system capabilities/performance (prior testing, test reports, etc.).  G)Description of logistics, training and maintenance requirements for the system. H)Cost for five (5) systems to be delivered to:   Naval EOD Technology Division 2008 Stump Neck Road, Bldg. 2195                       Indian Head, MD 20640 I)Cost and Description of personnel and material needed to support a minimum of a three (3) month test period at various locations within the U.S. to include: a.On call, one response from vendor to test site to resolve any issues with the systems being tested. b.Two (2) training sessions for testing personnel. c.Any and all parts and repairs necessary for the systems being tested.    J)Estimated system unit costs in quantities of 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000.  K)Estimated production rates including lead time and associated ramp up rates for production quantities of 20,000 plus.   SUMMARY:  This survey will be managed by the Naval Sea Systems Command.   The results of this evaluation (and upon request vendor-submitted material) will be provided to the U.S. Government agencies as required or necessary.  Mailed responses to this RFI must be received on or before January 26, 2007 at: Naval Sea Systems Command Attn: Bob Benion, SEA 0263, 1333 Isaac Hall Avenue, South East Bldg. 197, Room W2118, Washington Navy Yard, D.C. 20376.  Electronic responses should be sent to Robert.Benion@navy.mil and Tara.d.Davis@navy.mil.  The Government may elect to conduct one-on-one discussions with industry based on its analysis of the RFI responses, the quality of submission, and the level and specification of the information provided.  Please note the Government is under no obligation to conduct these sessions.  The information provided in response to this RFI will be used to support urgent, on-going, initiatives within DoD to analyze emerging requirements for systems tha!  t can improve the overall effectiveness of Coalition and Partner Nation CREW systems and may ultimately result in the Government developing and issuing a RFP for respondents.  The above information is provided for information only and is not a Request for Proposal or announcement of a solicitation.  This Request for Information is not constituted as a commitment by the Government to issue a contract or order.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement nor will the Government return any data provided.

<DESC>Criminal Alien Requirement 6 - Pre-Solicitation Notice
Modification No. 001

Description: The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has a requirement to house a population of approximately 7000 low security, non-US citizens, primarily Mexican sentenced male inmates in an existing secure correctional institution or institutions procured from state or local governments or private sources.  Faith Based and Community Organizations have an equal right to submit competitive proposals for any resulting contract(s).  The approximately 7000 inmates are presently located in West Texas.  This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small sized companies.  The BOP will fulfill this requirement through multiple awards and anticipates that each facility or complex of facilities will house approximately 900-3000 inmates.  Offerors are not prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates at the institutions(s).  If the proposed institution(s) houses a mixed population of BOP and non-BOP inmates, offers will be evaluated to determine the soundness and effectiveness in managing and operating the shared institution(s).  Institutions proposed shall meet BOP standards as set forth in the resulting contract.  The facility(ies) proposed must be located in Arizona, California, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, or Texas.  Expansion or renovation of existing institutions is permitted if completed within 270 calendar days after contract award when a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) as required by the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) exists.  When a FONSI does not exist as required by NEPA, expansion or renovation of existing institutions is permitted up to 20% of the existing square footage proposed and completed within 270 calendar days.  Any such expansion or renovation must not interfere with or delay the arrival of inmates as required by the resulting solicitation/contract.  Offerors shall demonstrate the ability to provide all personnel, equipment, materials, supplies and services necessary for the management and operation of a secure correctional institution.  The BOP intends to award a firm fixed-price type contract with award-fee incentives.  The contract will have a potential term of 10 years consisting of one four-year base period and three two-year option periods.  Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based statement of work based on American Correctional Association/Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions with a contractor management emphasis on quality control.  The offeror awarded the contract must be ready to accept inmates 120 days after contract award at a rate specified in the resulting contract.  The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued.  Past Performance and experience will be significant factors in the evaluation of offers.  Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government.  Information will be requested from offerors regarding past environmental activities and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located.  Prior to contract award, environmental documentation and other related information will be required in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  The BOP anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about 5/12/06 with an estimated response date of 07/12/06.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.  The solicitation will be available on or after 5/12/06 and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunity website http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  Interested parties requiring further information should email Heather L. Greiner, Contracting Officer, at hgreiner@bop.gov.

<RESPDATE>011807

<CONTACT>Edward G. Dawson Jr., 7034282020
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions received by the Government in response to the subject solicitation.  The attached questions and responses are offered as information only and do not in any way change the terms and conditions expre ssed in the solicitation.   Notice is provided that the tentatively scheduled pre-proposal conference identified in the solicitation is hereby canceled. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged. The following questions were submitted in response to Rail Repair Solicitation W81GYE-06-R-0037 by Boston Transit Group.  Answers to these questions are addressed below as well: 1. Who is the contractor that currently has the DODX maintenance and repair responsibilities as defined in the solicitation?  Answer - Currently, a single award for all rail support services is awarded to Intellitrans.  The contract number is DAMT01- 01-P-0328 While the three contracts solicited by M-SDDC are very different in nature than the current contract for which service is  provided, Intellitrans executes repair services through subcontracts.  Those subcontractors are Alabama Railcar Service (ARS) located in Ozark, AL, Custom Car Corporation (CCC) located in Meridian, MS. and Central California Railcar Repair (CCRR), Stockto n, CA.  ARS performs all tank car repairs. CCC performs a majority of non-tank car repairs.  CCRR has performed non-tank car repairs on approximately 10 rail cars. 2. What was the dollar amount awarded to date to the current DODX maintenance and repair contractor under their contract? Answer - The following are aggregate repair orders amounts for each year of the current contract DAMT01- 01-P-0328 expressed in FY order amounts: 	2002= 179,136.53 	2003= 428,701.52 	2004= 600,271.10 	2005= 974,342.09 	2006= 907,817.10 	2007 year to 12/20/06= 326,962.98 3. On page 17 of 75, it is stated that SDDC requires a minimum of 6 rail repair contractors. Minimally, the Government will endeavor to award (4) four AAR facilities and (2) two additional facilities having tank rail car repair and cleaning capability.  Awards are geographically disbursed in the government's best interest... If a bidder successfully demonstrates acceptable technical capability, meets the past performance standard, has the best offered pricing, and has facilities in all of the required locations/time zones, is it possible for that contractor to be awarded more than one location or the entire contract? Answer  The Government will evaluate LPTA in rank order by region.  Anything is possible to include a repair vendor providing both tank and non-tank repairs in each region and offering the low evaluated percentage offer in each.  The solicitation specific ally states: The Government intends to make multiple low price technically acceptable (LPTA) awards in regional rank order.  SDDC requires a minimum of 6 rail repair contractors.  Minimally, the Government will endeavor to award four (4) AAR facilities and two (2) addi tional facilities having tank rail car repair and cleaning capability.  Awards are geographically disbursed in the Governments best interest as follows: Region			Min. AAR awardees		Min. Tank Capable awardees Eastern time zone		1				1 Central time zone		2				1 Mountain/Pac. time zone	1				0 Should greater capacity be determined to be required prior to and at the time of award, additional LPTA awards may be added to the award matrix. What this means is that the Government had no reason to expect a reasonable number of companies to offer enough service and facilities to meet the entire requirement.  However, the Government does not dismiss the possibility.  The results of the competitio n will dictate multiple awards whose service is segregated by region, service type or both.   If a single award for all services is the result of the price competition among all technically acceptable offerors, then single award will be made based on that r esult or one company may receive multiple awards by region, service type or both as determined appropriate by the Contracting Officer.

Contracting Activity:  U.S. Army Contracting Agency, U.S. Army Contracting Command, Europe, Wiesbaden Contracting Center, ATTN; SFCA-EC-C-A, CMR 410, Box 741, APO AE 09096. 2.  Description of Action:  This action is to include CISCO brand name software updates, hardware replacement, and 24X7 Cisco Help Desk support within the proposed solicitation and contract for maintenance of CISCO equipment for the time period 11 January 2007 through 10 January 2008.  This will be a firm-fixed-price Operations and Maintenance Army (OMA) FY 2007 funded contract to support CISCO equipment within USAREUR.  Option years are not practicable due to the drastic changes to the list of equipment to  be maintained from year to year, which can vary from 400 to 700 pieces of equipment.  The decision as to which specific pieces of  Foundry equipment will be covered depends on several variables, including available budget, end of life/service consideratio ns, warranty expirations and criticality of the equipment pieces function.  The contract amount is estimated at $XXXXXX. 3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The 5th Signal Commands Army-Theater Network Operations Security Center (A-TNOSC) requires equipment repair, replacement, software updates and pertinent software documentation for CISCO equipment and twenty-four hour  telephone assistance for troubleshooting problematic equipment performance.  The services will support operability of CISCO equipment integrated into 5th Signal Command A-NIPRNet/A-SIPRNet systems within U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR). The advanced hardware r eplacement service included in the maintenance service enables 5th Signal Command to obtain replacement equipment once the Cisco help desk technician determines the need for hardware repair or replacement. 4. Authority Cited:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  5.  Reason for Authority Cited: a. T he 5th Signal Command utilizes CISCO routers with Foundry switches for the Army NIPRNet and SIPRNet within USAREUR.  The currently installed routers and switches have been tested and certified for technical integration and interoperability with other Depar tment of Defense (DoD) networks in accordance with DoD Directive 4630.5.  If unable to procure the required services on a brand name basis the potential cost for replacement of hardware, maintenance and repair, software upgrade, and other lifecycle costs a re estimated to exceed $10.2 million. b. Procurement of products other than CISCO brand name will create an unnecessary burden on the logistic support and maintenance structure, will not be cost effective, and is not in the best interest of the government.  Under such circumstances the governm ent would need to devise methods to recover costs for current replacement stocks with an estimated value of $232,000.  In addition, the unit would be required to reprocure adequate stock levels to ensure a 90% network readiness capability.  A change in pro duct brand would also require the unit to revamp the present training program.  Integration of product brands other than CISCO into the current network structure would void all CISCO warranties.  These costs do not encompass all associated costs that would  be incurred in the event of a change in brand.  However, the costs and associated factors identified serve as justification of the prohibitive nature associated with purchasing brands other than CISCO. 6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  In addition to soliciting those who have already shown interest in providing the services, the requirements will be synopsized in the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI). 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  There are no current actions that can be taken to increase competition in the maintenance of the Cisco systems.  As stated earlier, introduction of other brands other than Cisco into the network will create an unnecess ary burden on the government.  The government has been installing these systems in this Theater for the last 8+ years.  During the initial design of the network, no other comparable systems met the required specifications.  Throughout the years, Cisco had been the primary provider of the required systems and as such, the Theater topology was designed around the Cisco products.   8.  Market Research: CISCO, Apptis, GTSI Corp, Force3 and Northrop Grumman were solicited for the current contract and can also provide the needed services.  It is anticipated that the CISCO Company and resellers will be able to submit offers for the requi red services.  Opening the solicitation to a greater number of Cisco resellers has shown that better prices can be obtained rather than limiting the solicitation to a single Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contract.  As a standa rd commercial practice and business strategy, the manufacturer grants resellers discounted prices.  Thus, it is advantageous to the Government to obtain the services required by soliciting Cisco -licensed resellers based on other than full and open competi tion in order to obtain the lowest possible price. 9.  Interested Sources:  Firms that showed interest are Lockheed Martin, NCI Systems, QSS Group Inc., CISCO, Apptis Inc, GTSI Corp, Force3, Northrop Grumman, Enventis Telecom Inc, Siemens, IBM and T-Systems. 10. Other Facts:  a. Procurement History.  The 5th Signal command requirement for router services in support of the USAREUR A-NIPRnet and A-SIPRnet has been ongoing for over 8 years.  The 5th Signal Command currently maintains a minimal stock of Cisco equipment at the unit and command level to provide for immediate replacement when malfunctioning equipment is sent for repair to ensure a 90% network operability rate at any time. (1) The award for the contract currently in place was made to Enventis Telecom Inc., a reseller of Cisco products, under contract W912CM-06-P-1034. (2) The award was accomplished using other than full and open competition.  Several open market and FSS Cisco authorized resellers expressed an interest in the requirement.  Once the contract is awarded to the reseller, then the reseller subcontracts Cisco  to perform the services.  As such, when support is needed, the government technician contacts the Cisco help desk as instructed in the final contract with the reseller.  If a replacement item is required, the replacement is sent by Cisco pursuant to the a dvanced hardware replacement service in the maintenance services contract, and is then used to replace the equipment issued from stock. (3)  For 2004 and prior, maintenance was purchased via orders issued under GSA schedules with competition limited to vendors with reseller authority and GSA schedules. (4) The procurement of Cisco products (equipment and software) was accomplished on other than full and open competition based on brand name.  As required by DoDD 4630.5, the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) and the U.S. Army Information Systems  Engineering Commands (USAISEC) Technical Integration Center (TIC) have tested the Cisco Routers for interoperability and are JITC certified to work together on DOD networks.  As a result of the certification requirements, the government was given justifi cation to purchase and populate the Cisco products. (5) All prior years were accomplished through other than full and open competition.  11.

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov<BR><BR>The National Visa Center (NVC) needs to purchase one additional Pitney Bowes DM1000 Mailing Machine to meet the new US Postal Service digital requirements which take effect on January 1, 2007.  NVC processes all family- and employment-based immigrant visas issued by the US Government, for a total of approximately 800,000 cases a year. The DM1000 Mailing Machine is a digital mailing machine that seals, weighs, applies postage and then stacks mail that is sent throughout the US, Mexico and Canada. NVC currently has one DM1000 Mailing Machine. Because we send out an average of 65,000 pieces of mail each week (and up to 100,000 pieces on occasion), we need a second machine to handle the volume, speed up our processing, and serve as backup in case one machine goes down.    Because of the high volume of mail we process each week, it is crucial that both machines be the same model. Having to train people on two different machines with different operating panels would be extremely detrimental to our operations and would make the smooth processing of our outing mail extremely difficult. Moving from one machine to another that is not identical would inevitably lead to otherwise avoidable mistakes and slowdowns.  In addition, it would not/not be cost-effective to maintain and operate two different types and/or brands of machines.  As NVC already has one Pitney Bowes DM1000 Mailing Machine, we believe it will be in the best interests of the USG to purchase an identical second machine.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This posting is a rebroadcast of requirement that serves to also extend firm term.  Original ad was aired on January 9, 2006.

REQUIREMENT:  The U.S. Government is seeking to lease approximately 17,214 Rentable Square Feet yielding 14,969 ANSI/BOMA area square feet of contiguous office and related space, preferably on the ground level, in Salt Lake City, Utah.  If space is above ground level, a minimum of two elevator banks is required.  No mixed use space will be considered.  Build-to-suit will be considered based on the length of time necessary to deliver the space ready for occupancy.

Space must be situated within an area delineated by the following boundaries:

North:    North Temple Street
West:     300 West
South:    3300 South
East:     1300 East

The site should be within a convenient and safe walk of no more than two blocks to secured parking for both employee and visitor parking use.  Due to the high volume of daily visitors, at least seventy (70) to one hundred (100) parking spaces are required for public and employee use.  A minimum of five (5) reserved parking spaces are required immediately adjacent to the office.  The site should be within a relatively convenient walk to coffee shops, restaurants, banks and other retail establishments.  The site should be safely accessible by both automobile and public transportation throughout the extended workday (7:00 AM to 5:30 PM, Monday through Friday).  Site must be within two blocks of access to public transportation.

Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain.  Secure office space and facilities in an office building, fully serviced and altered to Government specifications are required, to include ample windows to provide natural lighting and both public and separate employee rest rooms (located in the non-public area of the office).  All services, supplies, utilities, and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.  

Occupancy will be required within nine months of lease award.  Lease term is 15 years with a firm term of 10 years.  

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership.  If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EST, January 19, 2007.  Expressions of interest should include building name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, and contact information for owner or authorized agent.  If a build-to-suit, indicate the size of the lot being offered, parcel number, map coordinates or fixed address, and provide aerial map if available.  

Address all replies to Authorized Representative of the General Services Administration (GSA) at:

<DESC>The Federal Government is seeking information regarding potential sources of supply for Telecommunications Expense Management (TEM) (or “managed services”) for wireless products and services.  This is a market research effort being conducted in order to determine industry capabilities and industry robustness.  This is neither a procurement announcement nor a guarantee that a procurement will be conducted in the future.  A solicitation is not available at this time. Additionally, there is no guarantee or commitment by the Federal Government that a solicitation will be created as a result of this announcement. Any requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. If you would like to be emailed an electronic version of this announcement in MS Word format, please send a request to the contracting officer listed below.

The Government values Industry input.  Accordingly, responses to this announcement are greatly appreciated.

Executive Summary

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum on May 20, 2005, entitled “Implementing Strategic Sourcing” mandating that federal agencies leverage spending as much as possible. (see www.caoc.gov)
	
On November 16, 2005, the General Services Administration and the Department of Treasury launched the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI).  The purpose of the initiative is to: (1) Test the ability to strategically source across federal agencies; (2) Share best practices and build the strategic sourcing community of practice; (3) Learn lessons applicable to future strategic sourcing efforts at the federal or agency levels; (4) Avoid unnecessary duplication of effort in responding to the OMB Strategic Sourcing Initiative.

FSSI is chartered under the purview of the Chief Acquisition Officer’s Council and the Strategic Sourcing Working Group, both of which are monitored by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy within OMB.  The Wireless Handheld Devices and Services commodity team (one of five under FSSI) includes representation from at least fourteen (14) federal departments and/or agencies, all of whom have agreed through a formal project charter to participate in the pilot in some capacity.

The primary objectives of the Wireless commodity team are to: (1) Establish a common procurement vehicle through which all Government agencies may procure and utilize wireless services; (2) Lower the total costs associated with wireless services while maintaining industry service levels; and (3) Utilize business intelligence to better support overall decision making and performance management.  

Purpose

The purpose of this Sources Sought (SS) is to gather sufficient information to assist in the decision making process of how to fulfill the Government's requirement to establish a common contracting arrangement to maintain agency information technology wireless programs to include, but not limited to, the acquisition of cellular devices [i.e. Cellular Phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), Blackberries, and Cellular Network Cards], cellular services, and the management of program requirements. It is contemplated that the scope of the contracting arrangement (should one be created) would cover ALL Government agencies.

FSSI Team:

The team assembled to accomplish this OMB directive consists of fourteen agencies with an estimated 200,000 wireless devices.  The number of Government wide devices that may require service is unknown, but substantial.  The Government makes no guarantee regarding the number of devices that may require services in the future.  

Requirements:

If a TEM approach is taken, the Government contemplates that it would require future Offerors to be able to propose a full managed services solution that supports procurement of wireless devices and services (local, regional, nationwide and International) through deployment, transfer, collection, engineering, management, operation, and disposal of wireless voice and data services for the Government.  A potential Offeror would likely be required to provide all program management services and support to the Government in administrating its programs.

The Government would require the flexibility to purchase or lease wireless services and equipment and pay only for actual minutes used for in-service/activated cellular devices.  

Additionally, if a TEM approach is taken, the Government contemplates that the procurement would be conducted as a small business set aside if market research indicates that a sufficient industry base exists.

Please note, responses to these questions will not be treated as a proposal.  Responses to this request shall be treated as market research and market research only.

1.	Please identify your company name, location, number of employees, small business size status, and contact information for at least two individuals within your company.

PLEASE NOTE:  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires that contractors be registered in the Central Contractors Registration Database and the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database, prior to being awarded a contract. The first step to register is to obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number which is a unique nine-character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun and Bradstreet (D&B).   To request a DUNS number call D&B at the toll free number 1-866-705-5711 or register on-line at http://www.dnb.com/ccr/register.html. Obtaining a DUNS number through this process is free of charge.  After obtaining your DUNS number register in CCR and OCRA by visiting the following websites:  http://www.ccr.gov and http://orca.bpn.gov.  The CCR Customer Assistance Center can be contacted toll free at 1-888-227-2423.   It behooves anyone who is interested in doing work with the Federal Government to begin this process as soon as possible since it can take several days to complete.  If the low apparently successful bidder does not become registered in both the CCR and the ORCA database within a time to be specified by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered bidder. Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONDUCTING MARKET RESEARCH.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT REVEIVE A RESPONSE. The program is seeking a replacement of the IT system that manages the loan guaranty program and former direct loan program.  This project is expected to include four components.  The database holds data in a legacy system which will need to be extracted and converted to a modern, flexible format.  The application needs to meet the business requirements detailed below.  The front end must be flexible and user-friendly.  Finally, the project requires a technology coordinator who can serve as a system integrator between the packages that are selected to provide the above components and ensure that they work together.  A vendor may apply to provide information as a source on any one, two, three, or all four of the above components.  Additionally, vendor products which provide a distinct portion of the application requirements but not all are invited to provide information as a potential source.  The system resides in Indian Affairs and supports the acquisition of vendors who qualify under the Buy Indian Act.   Sources interested should provide a description of their capabilities that match the above components an any requirements listed below which their products satisfy.   1.1	Introduction The Loan Guaranty, Insurance and Interest Subsidy Program was created by the Indian Financing Act of 1974 to stimulate and increase Indian entrepreneurship and employment through the establishment, acquisition or expansion of Indian-owned economic enterprises.  The Program is administered by the Division of Capital Investment in the Office of Indian Energy and Economic Development (IEED).  The Division's responsibilities include the approval of loan guaranty applications, loan default compensation, servicing existing direct loans and other services provided for in the 25 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 103. The Division of Capital Investment works as liaison with lending organizations, tribes, and Bureau of Indian Affairs credit offices. The program currently manages a portfolio of over $400 million in loan guarantees. This portfolio will be substantially increased when the loan management IT system becomes capable and compliant.  The project strongly encourages responses and proposed partnerships with Indian-owned firms.   1.2	Subject Current System Description The purpose of the loan management and accounting system (LOMAS) investment is to provide the Division of Capital Investment in the IEED with the ability to manage the guaranteed loan program and other loan services provided in the 25 CFR 103.  It has various loan management capabilities, some of which need to be updated to incorporate modern financial analysis tools.  Other areas of the system need to be made compliant with current regulations.  The program is involved with loan application review, data management, and report generation as needed by the credit officers.  We are seeking information on loan management systems which are or can be made compliant to government regulations (for example, JFMIP, FFMIA, and Section 508).  It will interface or integrate with other government financial systems (Federal Financial System (FFS) and the upcoming Financial and Business Management System (FBMS)).  It supports offices across the country so must have feasible networking capabilities to service limited-access areas.  Information is being requested for possible loan management solutions that will address the requirements below.    Current Processing Environment Indian Affairs currently has a processing environment based on Windows 2003 based servers with active directory implemented.  Oracle and SQL Server databases are supported.  The most recent third party applications implemented and applications developed in house have been Intranet-based.  However, the network is closed with no Internet Access. 1.3	Business Requirements of the Application The following requirements are provided to serve as a detailed description of the needs of the system.

<DESC>SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY for Blue Force Communications Interference Mitigation Capability for Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems. BACKGROUND:  Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems are currently being used in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) efforts.  CREW systems are being utilized by soldiers from all branches of the United States Military to defeat the increasing Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) threats while performing their duties in Theater.  However, CREW systems, when transmitting, interferes with co-located and nearby Blue Force Communications (BF COMMS) systems.  The level of interference is severe enough to cause the loss of all communications.  In addition, BF COMMS systems, when transmitting, interfere with the CREW system to the extent that the CREW systems become ineffective.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to identify technically mature systems, Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, that could potentially satisfy the compatibility/interoperability betwee!  n existing and future ground CREW and BF COMMS systems.  OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS: It is expected that compatibility systems will make it possible for Military forces to operate any CREW system effectively while simultaneously operating BF COMMS in the same vehicle and adjacent vehicles. BF COMMS consist of numerous systems in dismounted and mounted configurations based on common radio transceivers (RT).  Some of the more common RTs / applicable configurations /  waveform or system names are:  RT-1694D / AN/PRC-150, AN/VRC-104(V) / (Harris) HF ALE; RT-1796 / AN/PRC-117F, AN/VRC-103V1 / (Harris) TACSAT, SINCGARS, Have-Quick, VHF/UHF LOS; RT-1523(V) / AN/PRC-119(V), AN/VRC-87,88,89,90,91,92(V) / (ITT GD) SINCGARS; RT-1672 / AN/PSC-5 / SPITFIRE; RT-1672C / AN/PSC-5C / SHADOWFIRE; RT-1672D / AN/PSC-5D / (Raytheon) MBMMR, TACSAT, SINCGARS, Have-Quick, VHF/UHF LOS; RT-1720 / EPLRS; AN/PRC-148(V) / (Thales) MBITR, JEM, SINCGARS, Have-Quick, VHF/UHF LOS;  Blue Force Tracking (BFT) Systems; Movement Tracking System (MTS); and Global Positioni!  ng Systems (GPS) PLGR and DAGR.  This survey is intended to specifically investigate technically mature systems that are able to be mounted in various military and civilian vehicles.   GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: These general, unclassified system requirements are applicable: A) Size:  no larger than 11” x 11” x 3”	 B) Weight:  no heavier than 5 pounds C) Compatible with multiple Communication Systems D) Compatible with 2.0 and newer CREW Systems E) 24 VDC Tactical vehicle power and 12 VDC Civilian vehicle power F) Must have a minimum operational reliability of 90% with a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of a minimum of 800 hours. RESPONSES: Responses may be submitted in hard copy or electronic format. However, only vendors possessing a minimum of a Secret Clearance may submit a response to this RFI.  Responses must include:  A)Industry Point of Contact (PoC) for Technical and Contractual issues to include name, position, telephone, and email. B)Page Limit for Responses is 25 pages. C)Complete System Description. D)Overall capabilities of the system as compared against the above general requirements. E)Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the system with justification. F)Additional detailed information regarding the system capabilities/performance (prior testing, test reports, etc.).  G)Description of logistics, training and maintenance requirements for the system. H)Cost for five (5) systems to be delivered to:                  Naval EOD Technology                             Division                                                   2008 Stump Neck Road, Bldg. 2195 Indian Head, MD 20640 I)Cost and Description of personnel and material needed to support a minimum of a three (3) month test period at various locations within the U.S. to include: a.On call, one response from vendor to test site to resolve any issues with the systems being tested. b.Two (2) training sessions for testing personnel. c.Any and all parts and repairs necessary for the systems being tested.    J)Estimated system unit costs in quantities of 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000.  K)Estimated production rates including lead time and associated ramp up rates for production quantities of 20,000 plus.   SUMMARY:  This survey will be managed by the Naval Sea Systems Command.   The results of this evaluation (and upon request vendor-submitted material) will be provided to the U.S. Government agencies as required or necessary.  Mailed responses to this RFI must be received on or before January 26, 2007 at: Naval Sea Systems Command Attn: Bob Benion, SEA 0263, 1333 Isaac Hall Avenue, South East Bldg. 197, Room W2118, Washington Navy Yard, D.C. 20376.

<DESC>ARS Evaluation and Validation:  
Vendor Identification:  The United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) is conducting market research to identify vendors that manufacture live animal antibiotic and sulfonamide multi-residue Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) kits for tissue fluids (urine and/or serum) to meet FSIS needs.  

Overall program/project objectives:  After vendor identification, FSIS is requesting that a third party, the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) evaluate and validate current live animal antibiotic and sulfonamide multi-residue Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) kits for tissue fluids (urine and/or serum) to meet  FSIS needs.  

Background: The Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act are the basis for FSIS regulatory program to protect the public from adulterated meat and poultry products.  Drugs, pesticides, and other chemicals used in animal husbandry practices as well as environmental contaminants may result in the adulteration of meat and poultry products because their presence in animal tissues may exceed regulatory tolerance levels.  FSIS issued the Pathogen Reduction-Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Systems (PR/HACCP) final rule in 1996 as a means to modernize its system of food safety regulations.  Under PR/HACCP, federally inspected establishments are expected to take preventive as well as corrective measures at each of the food production processing steps and consider what food safety hazards (including drug, pesticide, and other chemical contaminant residues) can occur before, during, and after entry into an establishment.  

In November 2000, FSIS published a Federal Register notice announcing its intention to reconsider how PR/HACCP should affect its approach to controlling residues in or on meat and poultry products.  Although improvements have been made in reducing the amount of residues detected in meat and poultry products, violations continue to persist.  In an effort to support establishments developing more effective systems of residue control and to fulfill an FSIS mission that firmly positions the National Residue Program into a HACCP environment, FSIS is encouraging producers, establishments and inspection personnel to use live animal testing for antibiotics and sulfonamides prior to slaughtering. 

Testing live animals will enable establishments to determine whether an animal has potentially violative levels of antibiotic residues in its tissues.  Knowing this will allow establishment personnel to reduce economic losses from slaughtering animals that may be later condemned because of violative levels of residues. This in turn may decrease the amount of drug residues entering the food chain.  Using live animal testing will benefit everyone,industry, FSIS, and the consumer - invested in food safety. 

Request for Information: To validate the multi-residue ELISA kits available in the market, FSIS is seeking sources capable of providing FSIS with a single in-plant test that is capable of detecting multiple antibiotic residues at tolerance levels in urine and/or serum.  The respondent will need to submit data on a range of drugs from each compound class as well as a description of the protocol used to determine the limits of detection, which should reflect tests run in an appropriate matrix (serum or tissue).  After reviewing the submitted data, FSIS may request additional information.  Respondents will need to describe the method used to determine the limits of detection and the limits of detection for each drug tested.  A complete description of the procedure, along with estimated times required per analysis, should also be submitted.   

FSIS is searching for vendors who can provide ELISA test kits having the following desirable characteristics:    
 
Screen multiple tissues from multiple animal species
High sensitivity (close to drug tolerance levels)
Economical
Rapid turnaround time
Suitable for in-plant use
Minimal instrumentation, simple equipment, easy to use
No requirement for organic solvents, toxic reagents, or radioactive constituents  
Practical for establishments having multiple shifts

If your company is a source capable of providing such a test please respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis with your company information to include identifying if your company is a small or large business along with pricing information.  The NAICS Code for this notice is 325413 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.
This notice is not a request for proposals and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information they provide.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, the information will be used in FSIS assessment of capable sources.  Responses should be submitted by January 30, 2007.  Faxed responses are not permitted.  Questions concerning this announcement may be submitted via email only, no telephone inquires will be honored. Questions and Responses may be submitted by email to deborah.robertson@fsis.usda.gov; or by mail to Deborah Robertson at USDA, FSIS, ASD, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Mail Drop 5230, Beltsville, MD 20705; or by fax at 301-504-4276.

<DESC>The U.S. Special Operations Command, Technology Applications Contracting Office (TAKO), ATTN: AMSAT-D-TK, Lee Boulevard, Building 401, Fort Eustis, VA, 23604-5577 issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding the top-level functional and operational capabilities, performance, and design for an avionics grade data receptacle product that provides an intelligent microprocessor-based unit that permits data transfer by providing sockets for some form of portable, securable storage media, and can communicate via dual independent 10/100BaseT Ethernet ports.

1.	Background

During development of the Common Avionics Architect System (CAAS) for 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) (SOAR (A)) helicopter fleet it has been discovered that the current data loader device does not have the required throughput to support the loading of mission specific data in a timely manner.  An example is the Embedded Digital Map (EDMG), which allows the addition of outside reference data, referred to as GEO Chips,  (such as digital pictures, JPEG files, etc.) to be associated with a specific target.  These files cannot be stored in persistent memory as they may be classified.  The current data loader cannot transfer these files in a timely manner.  The current data loader utilizes PCMCIA memory cards to store mission data.  This data is transferred via the MIL-STD-1553B data bus to the mission processor.  The maximum transfer speed is 1 MB/sec.  Each GEO chip is anticipated to be in excess of 2 MB.  The current data loader is limited to maximum of 1 megabit/sec transfer rate (a 16 megabyte file will take a minimum of 128 seconds to transfer).  TAKO is looking for a product with technical capability to provide a faster data transfer rate, increased memory storage capacity, storage of classified data that can be rapidly zeroized, with minimal impact to current physical installation.
  
2.	Operations Concept 

The envisioned new data loader should be able to utilize the latest avionics grade secure storage media technology to store the mission data and be able to transfer that data to the CAAS Ethernet Avionics System LAN that transfers the data to the on board mission processors.  There are significant technical issues involved, including but not limited to:  maximum transfer rates, single vs. multiple line rates (server), in device RAM Cache, single client (sustain) vs. multiple client (peak) read/write potential, maximum transfer rates, in device video/audio recording and playback, secure storage capabilities for storage media (i.e. PCMIA, Compact Flash, USB Memory Sticks, etc).  Also, for consideration is the requirement for the lightest and smallest unit possible to limit and/or improve the cube and weight requirements for use on the aircraft.

3.	System Requirements 

3.1.	Four to Six Storage Media Sockets

3.1.1.	Slot 1 - DAFIF data (read only to meet uncorruptable database requirement for GATM)
	Slot 2 - Mission Planning Data (Read/Write)(ACP Lists, Flight Plans, Communication Frequency and COMSEC Presets, etc)
Slot 3 - GEO Chip data (Read/Write) (imagery that is linked to a specific geo reference point and can be displayed on the map, i.e. picture of target)
	Slot 4 - Electronic Order of Battle (Read/Write) (can be updated based upon on-board aircraft sensors)
	Slot 5 ? Growth
	Slot 6 ? Growth 

4.	Ethernet interface

4.1.	Supports Ethernet protocols:

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
Network File Server (NFS)
Common Internet File System (CIFS) / Samba /SMB)

5.	Weight Requirements:  Objective 3 lbs to Threshold 5 lbs.

6.	Size Requirements:  No larger than:  Length 8.5? x Width 5.75? x Height 2.25?

7.	Mounting Requirements:  Can be mounted via Dzus rail.

8.	Zeroization:  Fast erase and secure erase capabilities for zeroization via software or discrete commands

9.	Growth Capability:  Gigabit Ethernet, additional mass storage.

10.	Environmental and EMI Qualifications:  Must be able to qualify to MIL-STD-461, ADS-37A, and MIL-STD-810F for the majority of the EMI/Environmental considerations.  The vibration qualification is based on a combination of several standards to meet the requirements for different aircraft.  
11.	Product Availability:  6 months ARO 

12.

<SUBJECT>C--Dolph Mine fire Inspection Services
<DESC>CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION SERVICES DOLPH COLLIERY MINE FIRE OLYPHANT, LACKAWANNA CO., PA WB-06-035 Inspection Demand    Pre-Bid:  January 7, 2007;   1:00 PM   The project will begin with installation of the E & S Controls and Clearing and Grubbing. Very quickly, the waterline installation, sewer line re-route, drilling, and excavation in unconsolidated material will commence. Eventually, we hope to have 2 draglines working 20 hrs./day - 7 days/week for ~125 days. The project will involve ~750,000cy of excavation and conclude with site restoration.  These activities will necessitate a significant amount of inspection.  During the busiest times (when 2 drag lines are working), 2 inspectors/shift will be needed with another overlapping and/or working in the trailer compiling maps/cross sections/summarizing quantities and organizing reports for a total of 350 inspection hrs./week. The firm should stagger the schedules to allow at least a 1 hour overlap between shifts so that site conditions and situations can be discussed by inspectors. At slower times, possibly during startup and during grading & demobilization, we may only need 1 inspector/shift with another overlapping for a total of 210 hours/week. During the first week until equipment is brought onsite and lights can be installed, the inspection need may be as little as 140 hours per week.  The Inspectors will be working in difficult conditions, including hazardous terrain, blasting, artificial lighting, winter weather, overhead equipment, and the normal threats posed by an underground mine fire. These threats include dangerous gases (CO) and hot air borne materials. Access to the work site will likely require a 4-wheel drive vehicle with clearance. The Construction Contractor will provide a heated trailer that contains tables, chairs, electricity, and water. A portable toilet will also be provided for the workforce. While one inspector may be situated in the trailer for most of a shift, it is anticipated that the other inspectors will be primarily working outside during the shift. The inspectors should be capable of being outside in the elements for extended periods of time, and be able to get around in the varied terrain of the worksite to perform gas and temperature monitoring, as well as volume and area calculations. The successful bidder for inspection must provide gas measurement equipment and shielded thermocouples and meters that are accurate in moist environments to depths of 150 feet. The Inspection firm will be required to present weekly reports on all operations to OSM no later than Monday of the following week. The inspection firm will also be responsible for indicating the location of boreholes on the project plans, preparing cross sections as requested and performing other duties as assigned. The inspection firm must be capable of providing all video and still photography in digital format. The important high quality photos selected by the COR must be provided in a captioned bound format, approved by the COR. The remaining photos must be provided in a COR approved digital format.  Also, the video must be provided in a DVD format. The inspection firm will be allocated up to 24 hours to prepare a detailed final report. OSM plans to issue a single contract with one firm, to provide all the inspectors needed. All Inspectors onsite will have to be certified by OSM for this type of work. The certification process begins by submitting a resume to OSM and, if approved, the candidate must attend an unpaid orientation that involves viewing 8 hours of video  Prospective firms must submit a technical proposal that describes in a detailed Management Plan  how the firm will provide and schedule all of the Inspectors necessary. It must include the names of the OSM Mine Fire Certified Inspectors as well as the names of the other OSM Certified Inspectors who will work along with the Mine Fire Inspector. At least one OSM Certified Mine Fire Inspector must be onsite at all times during each work shift, while additional inspectors on the shift must be OSM Certified in Drilling and/or Excavation & Backfilling. The technical proposal shall provide a contingency plan in the event that a key inspector is sick, injured, or otherwise unable to perform his/her duties. The firm will be required to develop and maintain all reports and records regarding contract bid items and quantities. This includes, but is not limited to, drilling records, excavation, blasting, water usage, sewer line work, as well as photographic and video records. It will involve performing field measurements for pay items that require area measurements for payment. Volumetric measurements for payment regarding the two excavation items will be compiled by others, however daily volumetric estimates of excavation must be calculated by the Inspector. The Inspector will also be required to perform other related duties as requested by the COR. Each Inspector must provide and carry a cell phone at all times while at work.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA The Technical Proposal separately addressing  the respective geographical areas, " Instructions to Offerors" relative to Statement of Work requirements, will be evaluated and point scored by a committee of technically qualified OSM employees assisted by OSM Contracting personnel in accordance with factors listed below: 1.	Implement and supervise Required Work (reflected in Management Plan) - 30% a.	Availability and allocation of staff resources and equipment to meet requirements  -  15% b.	Management supervision and coordination with subcontractors to meet requirements  -  15%      2.	Qualification of Personnel  -  50% Staff qualifications and experience to meet requirements  -  50% 3.	Corporate Specialized Experience - 20% a.	Familiarity with area and conditions in which projects are likely  -  10% b.	Experience with similar projects  -  10%      Award will be made to that responsible Offeror  whose offer, conforming to this Request for Quote is most advantageous to the Government, the elements listed above, and other factors considered.

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL THERAPIES The deadline for submitting capability statements in response to this notice is extended to February 15, 2007
<DESC>Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration

MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL THERAPIES 
FOR PATIENTS WITH WELL CHARACTERIZED GASTROPARESIS

The deadline for submitting capability statements in response to this notice has been extended to February 15, 2007.

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks collaborations with industry to provide novel agents and devices for randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials of novel therapies for the treatment of patients with well-characterized gastroparesis.  

Gastroparesis is a clinical syndrome characterized by multiple symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, and early satiety.  Physiological studies are characterized by delayed emptying of the stomach.  There are multiple etiologies, such as diabetes and surgical injury to the vagus nerve, but the most common etiological category is idiopathic.

INTRODUCTION:  The Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC) will conduct multicenter clinical research studies of patients with gastroparesis using defined clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions and will collect samples that may be useful for ancillary studies of etiology and pathogenesis. 

A prospective Gastroparesis Registry of patients with diabetic, idiopathic, and post-surgical gastroparesis was created by the newly formulated NIDDK-funded Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC) that will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of approximately 1,000 patients for 3 years on average.  In addition to collecting clinical patient data, Registry patients will submit serum and DNA samples.  Thus, ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathophysiology, diagnosis, imaging studies, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, and determinants of progression and severity of gastroparesis also pose collaborative opportunities.

STUDY GOALS:  The GpCRC principal investigators wish to consider potential new diagnostics and therapeutics for patients with gastroparesis.  The overall goal of the GpCRC is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with gastroparesis using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of gastroparesis and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by using the Gastroparesis Registry which includes clinical information as well as serum and DNA samples.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies that are interested in collaborating with GpCRC by providing novel therapeutic agents or devices for randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials of novel therapies, which could include: (1) prokinetic agents such as dopamine D-2 receptor antagonists, motilin receptor agonists, serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT4) receptor agonists, or cholecystokinin receptor antagonists versus placebo; (2) tricyclic antidepressant and related agents such as selective serotonin or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors versus placebo; (3) botulinum toxin injection versus placebo; (4) antiemetic agents such as aprepitant or serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) inhibitors such as palonosetron versus placebo; (5) novel analgesic agents such as pregabalin or gabapentin or derivatives of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) versus placebo; (6) gastric electrical stimulation or other devices versus placebo; and (7) complementary therapies such as herbal medicine, acupressure and electrical acustimulation, or acupuncture versus placebo in patients with well characterized gastroparesis.

The NIDDK is also seeking capability statements from companies for ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathophysiology, diagnosis, imaging studies, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, and determinants of progression and severity of gastroparesis.  Examples of potential ancillary studies include:  1) Exploration of serum markers for gastroparesis and serum markers for disease activity to predict gastric histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical, laboratory, proteomic, and metabolomic variables in the Gastroparesis Registry;  2) Exploration of the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in gastroparesis treatment trials;  3) Development of serum proteomic, metabolomic, and genomic expression arrays that are diagnostic of gastroparesis and that would provide surrogates for symptom severity as well as insights into the pathophysiology of this disease; and 4) Evaluation of the role of noninvasive imaging methods for assessing disease activity in gastroparesis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories.  They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services.  The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator.  Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort.  The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration.  The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.  Examples of the Clinical Trial Agreement and the CRADA can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  The Steering Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Steering Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages of narrative and should address the following selection criteria:  

1.	The proposed preparation must have been tested in Phase I trials in humans.
2.	The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized in the investigation of therapeutic agents including drugs, biologics, and devices in patients with gastroparesis and clearly describe important issues surrounding the evaluation of disease management in these patients.  
3.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the laboratory test agents in a timely manner for the duration of the study.  
4.	A description of laboratory tests that are needed including assays and required amount of specimens, to determine specific biomarker levels along with appropriate methods for performing.
5.	A description of other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  
6.	A description of the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.
7.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment and evaluation of gastroparesis, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development.  
8.	If appropriate, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research.
9.	Must agree to have their preparation used in the above-mentioned GpCRC-developed protocols which will be conducted by GpCRC and will have data collection and analysis performed by the GpCRC Data Coordinating Center.
10.	Must provide IND sponsor of the GpCRC studies with cross-reference access to a US FDA filing that contains the chemistry, manufacturing and controls information for the drug substance and drug product.
11.	Dosing and Pharmacokinetic data from human studies must be provided for novel agents.
11. 	Adverse event profile from human studies must be provided. 
12. 	Must agree to share (with GpCRC) all safety data from other studies involving their preparation as well as relevant efficacy data from other studies (updated Investigator Brochure, etc).
13.	The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results.

SUBMISSION DATES:  Only written capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before February 15, 2007 will be considered.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a small business set-aside.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541512.
Description:  Technical Support Specialist (TSS) (as described below).  
Quantity:  0001 - Base period of approximately nine (9) months (1413 hours); 1001 - Option Year One (1880 hours); 2001 - Option Year Two (1880 hours).

STATEMENT OF WORK - BACKGROUND:  In 2002, the OCC contracted with OPM to have vendor GeoLearning, an application service provider, customize an off-the-shelf learning management system to meet OCCs needs in the area of learning management.  The Continuing Education Division has been working with GeoLearning to implement and maintain this Learning Management System (LMS) and eLearning delivery platform that enables the OCC to plan, develop, manage, track, and deliver internal training content.  The GeoLearning LMS:  1)  Automates the administration of training events; 
2)  Provides managers, administrators, customers, and students with the ability to manage their internal learning activities; 3)  Allows OCC to manage, track, and deploy elearning of all modalities to employees, including instructor-led, on-line training, and self-studies across an extended enterprise;  4)  Allows OCC to manage resources, content, and learners.  OCC is currently exploring a replacement platform for the current LMS.  Tentative plans are to implement Plateau within the next year.  The TSS should have experience using primarily GeoLearning and secondarily, Plateau.  SCOPE OF REQUIREMENT - Contractor support is required for ongoing maintenance and support of the current system, as well as for migration from the current LMS to replacement LMS system with subsequent support for ongoing maintenance and enhancements.   The current LMS includes a course catalog, course registration functionality, course scheduler, online vendor courseware, courseware development tool, test/survey evaluation tool, alternate approval functionality, a bulletin board, shared calendar, and chat room.  In order to meet reporting requirements, OCC Information Technology staff developed a data mart which incorporates training data from a legacy mainframe system and supplemental external training and certification database applications.  This data has been combined with data originating in the LMS (which is downloaded on a daily basis).  Contractor support is required for developing ad hoc and corporate reports using the data mart as a source application.  Contractor support is required to implement a new learning management system.  This includes analyzing current business processes and re-engineering to adapt to the functionality available in a new system.  Customizations are not planned for the new LMS.  The contractor shall support the project as follows:  
1)  Provide administrative support to the OCC LMS project manager.  2)  Collaborate with other team members working on migration to LMS and provide support on the following:   a.

This solicitation is hereby amended as follows:  

The due date for this solicitation is changed from December 13, 2006 to 3:30 PM local time December 20, 2006. 

This requirement includes the following:

LINE ITEM 0001

1)       Vendor shall provide 20 truncated rectangular pyramids of accurately dimensioned oriented graphite block of specified chemical purity, density, mosaic distribution, and neutron transmission characteristics for MACS Scattered Beam Filter.  Thickness: 50mm.  Ref: Drawing  03802453 Rev-5. 
			
2)       Vendor shall provide pre-performance material sample (one month after receipt of order and prior to beginning of the production run).  The pre-performance materials sample shall be representative of the filter material to be delivered. The pre-performance sample, can be a laminated structure, and shall have a thickness along the c-direction of 50 mm. The dimensions in both orthogonal directions perpendicular to the c-axis shall be between 20 mm and 50 mm.

3)	Vendor shall provide a certified material analysis: Materials delivered under this order shall be accompanied by a certified materials analysis indicating the graphite and impurity content and the average mosaic distribution in the block as measured through X-ray diffraction.  

The government will perform at least two types of analysis on the pre-performance materials sample and will report the results to the vendor within 1 month of receiving the sample. The analysis will include: 
 
1)	Diffraction using 14.7 meV neutrons to determine the mosaic distribution.  
2)	Measurement of the neutron transmission along the c-axis as a function of neutron energy. 

Upon vendor request, the government will also carry out such measurements on material intended for inclusion in the product during the production phase. The results of such measurements will be reported to the vendor within 1 month of receiving the material. The total quantity of material to be analyzed in this fashion shall not exceed the total amount of material ordered. 

The Government analysis of material provide by the vendor does not relieve the vendor from their responsibility with respect to meeting the requirements set forth herein.

The materials shall meet the following specifications:
Materials Specifications 

Chemical Composition and Density:
This specification ensures sufficient content of the desired oriented graphite majority phase. 
-	Carbon as Pyrolytic Graphite >99% by weight
-	The overall density of each filter block (volume to be that defined by the corresponding drawings) shall exceed 95% of the room temperature density of Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite, which is 2.26g/cm3.
Mosaic Distribution
This specification is set to maximize transmission in the intended application and to maximize efficiency as a filter for higher order neutrons. 
-	The average c-axis direction for a filter block shall be parallel to the high symmetry axis (the beam direction) of the blocks to within 1 degree. 
-	The average Full Width at Half Maximum Mosaic width for each of the twenty filter blocks as measured with 14.7 meV neutrons shall not exceed 5 degrees.
 
Neutron Transmission Specification

This specification ensures adequate neutron transmission in the operating energy range. Factors that reduce neutron transmission are neutron absorbing impurities, lattice defects, large mosaic distribution widths, and graphite powder inclusions.
-	The neutron transmission coefficient shall exceed 65% under these conditions: 
o	Room temperature. 
o	Neutron energies from 2.5 meV to 7 meV and 8 to 14.7 meV 
o	Transmission along the c-axis. 

Overall Physical Dimensions and Lamination Requirements

The physical dimensions, tolerances and surface finish of the twenty filter blocks are specified on the attached drawings.

The filter blocks can be built as laminated structures detailed by the vendor. If the vendor builds the filter blocks as laminated structures, then they must adhere to the following requirements in order to ensure that the potentially laminated bodies can be mounted effectively and that there are no open joints along beam axis 
-	Lamination planes shall be perpendicular to the central axis of the blocks.
-	This requirement is to prevent streaming through cracks in the lamination. The lamination structure shall preclude straight line neutron propagation within 10 degrees of the cylinder axis without passage through at least 35 mm solid graphite. 
-	The overall density of the laminated bodies with volume as defined by the corresponding drawings shall be at least 95% of the density of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. 


Acceptance:

A certification of compliance with all specifications from the vendor shall be a condition for acceptance. In addition, one or more of the following acceptance tests will be carried out to ensure compliance with specifications: 
	Physical inspection to assure that the dimensions and tolerances are consistent with the supplied drawings. 
	Measurement of the weight of the filter blocks to determine whether the overall density (with volume as specified by the corresponding drawing) exceeds 95% of the density of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. 
	Measurement of the overall mosaic distribution of the filter block using 14.7 meV neutrons. 
	Neutron diffraction measurements to ensure that the average c-axis direction coincides with the high symmetry axis of the filter blocks to within 1degree.
	Measurement of the neutron transmission along the c-axis for a range of neutron energies. 

The Government intends to carry out the above testing within one month of delivery of the filter blocks.  The vendor may deliver the filter blocks in batches of five (5) provided that all twenty (20) units are delivered within six months ARO.

Delivery:

Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule. 
The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.
