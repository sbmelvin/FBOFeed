<DESC>THIS FEDBIZOPPS POSTING IS STRICTLY A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE THAT IS PART OF A TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH SURVEY THAT IS BEING CONDUCTED FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY; IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS OR PROPOSALS.

The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland seeks to identify potential sources that currently can provide, or will soon be able to provide, commercially available, or soon-to-be commercially available, slap fingerprint segmentation software.  Such software may be selected by the Government to participate in the Ongoing Slap Fingerprint Segmentation Evaluation II (SlapSegII), a government-sponsored technology evaluation of algorithms used to segment slap fingerprint images. This is a continuation of the original SlapSegII evaluation that was completed on February 17th, 2009.

Note: Slap fingerprints (slaps) are also known as four-finger simultaneous plain impressions; slaps are taken by simultaneously pressing the four fingers of each hand onto a scanner or fingerprint card. Slap segmentation is the process by which a single image containing four fingerprint images is divided into four images of the individual fingers.

Potential sources of such software will neither be funded by NIST, nor charged by NIST, to participate in Ongoing SlapSegII.  Information on how to participate and details about the evaluation are available at http://fingerprint.nist.gov/slapsegII.  INTERESTED PARTIES MUST SUBMIT INFORMATION TO slapseg@nist.gov, AND CONTACT THAT SAME EMAIL ADDRESS WITH ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.
