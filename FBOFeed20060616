<DESC>USAID supports regional and bilateral programs that will buttress the key goals of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Community and the US Government (USG), outlined in the Joint Vision Statement (JVS) for Enhanced US-ASEAN Partnership.  A primary USG vehicle for providing this support during the first five to eight years of the US – ASEAN Enhanced Partnership will be the proposed ASEAN Development Vision to Advance National Cooperation and Economic Integration (ADVANCE) indefinite quantity contract (IQC). The objective of the ADVANCE IQC is to provide a vehicle to support the ASEAN Secretariat and work with and through ASEAN member states’ governments, civil society and the private sector to achieve results consistent with the goals outlined in the Joint Vision Statement. Assistance priorities will depend on the amount and type of funding available, USG legal and policy objectives and priorities of USAID. In particular, USAID expects to provide technical assistance, support and services to:

1.	Strengthen the Secretariat consistent with the Vientiane Action Program (VAP) by increasing its capacity to fulfill its mandate to initiate, advise, coordinate, and implement effective ASEAN activities including support of member states in their strategic development initiatives.

2.	Implement regional activities that enhance ASEAN integration and cooperation consistent with other specific VAP directives, including, but not limited to: economic integration, economic governance, commercial legal reform, intellectual property rights (IPR), trade capacity building (TCB), trade facilitation, customs reform, trade negotiations, SME development, cluster based competitiveness, supply chain development,  macroeconomic and policy reform, investment, financial sector surveillance and reform, capital market development, rule of law and legal reform, anti-corruption initiatives, human rights, immigration policy, trafficking in persons (TIP), regional security, counter-terrorism, cross-border environmental issues, energy efficiency and policy, regional health policy, regional emergency preparedness.

3.	Leverage the funding and expertise of development partners such as corporations, foundations, ASEAN member countries, other donors and NGOs to address jointly defined development challenges which are consistent with the objectives outlined in the JVS. 

USAID anticipates that ASEAN members in the region will require assistance from ADVANCE and that demand for services provided under the ADVANCE IQC will increase over time. The estimated ceiling of the IQC will be $150 million for a period of 5 years. 
Anticipated contractor duties include provision of technical and advisory services, training, research, and other services to: USAID missions, bureaus, and their clients. The contractor shall provide these services through execution of task orders with specified performance goals and bench-marks for achievement of objectives.
Detailed information about this solicitation will be contained in the RFP documents that will be available on or after July 7, 2006 on this website.  The closing date for the submission of the proposals, to be specified in the RFP, will be about 40-45 days thereafter.  All questions related to this notice must be addressed in writing, fax or email, to the Senior Acquisition Specialist at the address stated above.

The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet.  By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5" floppy disk (MS Word XP format), via e-mail, or in hard copy.  Requestors must confirm to the RCO their inability to access the RFP via the Internet before they request a diskette or hard copy of the document.  The notice can be viewed and downloaded using this website.  The solicitation, once issued, can also be downloaded from this website.  Requestors are encouraged to access the solicitation via the Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing in general, and from overseas Missions, in particular. 
	
Once the RFP is issued, Requestors must confirm in writing to the RCO receipt of the solicitation through the Internet.  As the recipient of this solicitation document, the requestor is responsible for ensuring that you have received it from the Internet in its entirety.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.  Further, please be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site where the solicitation was posted.  Generally, the RCO will send a copy of RFP amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt.  However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet.  Requestors are therefore advised to regularly check the FedBizOpps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/) for amendments.  The publication of this notice does not obligate the USG to issue an RFP or to award a contract.

<DESC>Solicitation Notice.  Solicitation Number is 6TS-06-JAS-0003.  This is a Solicitation Notice, the Request for Proposals (RFP) will be posted on FBO on or about June 16, 2006.  This procurement is for the NEC Telecommunications Switch Maintenance and Follow-On Services for Government-owned NEC switching systems located in the Region 6 Area. (Current service locations are Kansas City St. Louis, and Springfield, MO; Kansas City, Wichita and Topeka, KS; and Lincoln, NE).  GSA may also order equipment, services, new PBX systems and/or maintenance of additional systems, located within this Region’s four state geographic boundary Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska.  The Government may also utilize this contract as a source of supply for the purchase, installation, maintenance and miscellaneous services for NEC proprietary instruments, key system equipment, and ancillary devices and cabling and wiring.  The Government has determined that ONLY NEC Authorized Distributors can submit offers as prime contractors under this solicitation. All offerors submitting proposals must provide proof of their status as a NEC Authorized Distributor. The proposing contractor will be required to furnish a current letter of good standing or a manufacturer’s support commitment letter from NEC.  Brand Name Justification for NEC is as follows:  1. Maintenance Service from NEC Authorized Distributors.  In order to maintain warranties and upper level technical support on the equipment, the manufacturer requires maintenance services be provided by authorized distributors of the equipment.  Upper level technical support, which NEC calls NTAC (NEAX Technical Assistance Center), is support from the highest level technical experts at the manufacturer (NEC).  It is used to investigate, assess and solve problems which are too difficult or systemic to be solved by the local technicians.  If this service is not available some problems could potentially not be correctable, which could cause the system to be inoperable or unable to provide certain needed functions.  The risk of harm to the Government resulting from the loss of warranty protection and inability to provide adequate service to our customers is far greater than any short term financial savings that might be gained from having a non-authorized maintenance provider.  2.  Telephone Sets.  The only options for desk telephone sets that can be used with the NEC PBXs are basic analog, single line sets or D-Term digital sets.  The analog sets do not allow the user to easily access much of the functionality that is built into the PBX.  Some features are not available at all with an analog set, and others are available only by dialing a specific feature code for each feature.  Examples of commonly used features are call pickup, 3-way calling, transferring, call forwarding, speed dialing, call waiting and direct voice mail access.  Our experience has shown that most customers heavily rely on these features.  The proprietary telephone sets manufactured by NEC allow users to easily utilize all of these features by simply pressing a button on the telephone.   3.  NEC Electronic Circuit Cards.  Electronic circuit cards inserted into the PBXs provide the connectivity and functionality of the equipment.  These cards are only manufactured by NEC; there are no alternative manufacturers.  NEC sells these cards only to registered owners or authorized distributors of the specific product. (End of NEC Brand Name Justification).

This procurement will be full and open competition restricted to NEC authorized distributors with OEM Certifications.  An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Fixed Price contract will be awarded.  The term of the contract will be a base period of one (1) year with four (4) one-year options.  The maximum value of this ID/IQ contract will be $7,000,000 over the 5 year life.  The minimum guaranteed amount will be $50,000 for the base year and $50,000 for each option year, if exercised.  Proposals will be due 3:00pm, local time, July 13, 2006.  Send inquiries and questions to Jackie Simington via email at Jackie.simington@gsa.gov or by Fax to (816) 823-3322.  A pre-proposal meeting will be held in Kansas City, MO on Tuesday, June 27, 2006 at 10:00 a.m.   Please e-mail to address on the form Form A-1 which is included in RFP, Part A, to Rick Reynolds or fax to 816-926-6332 to reserve a spot.   Site tour of locations in Kansas City will be conducted following the Pre-proposal conference on June 27, 2006 at 10:00am (CST).   This procurement is full and open, and not set aside under FAR Part 19.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to negotiate with Claritas, Inc., Arlington, VA for the use of site licenses, technical support, and training for Claritas, Inc. software and databases. The site licenses which include over 100 discrete databases are required to perform complex analyses by geography (e.g., zip code), by mode of transportation, by ethnicity or culture, by age, by income levels, occupation, household wealth; by alcohol consumption, type of vehicle, by television viewing habits (Nielsen ratings), radio listening preferences (Arbitron ratings), store preferences, travel and commute times for various transportation modes, product purchase preferences, and PRIZM/NE lifestyle cluster database.  In addition, the licenses include proprietary mapping software which allows NHTSA to translate data to maps which range in detail from zip code level to the entire country.  

The NHTSA, in fulfilling its functional responsibilities, conducts and directs research and develop programs necessary to support ongoing efforts to advance the state-of-the-art in highway and motor vehicle safety.  An important aspect of the research and program development requires use of proprietary socio-geodemographic databases to determine the particular characteristics of people who are at risk.  Knowing the characteristics, enable NHTSA to better design, develop and tailor programs concerning impaired driving,  occupant protection, speed, motorcycles, and pedestrians. Over the course of approximately fifteen (15) years, the scientists at NHTSA have used specific proprietary software and databases developed by Claritas, Inc. to gain better understanding of traffic safety issues and the appropriate target groups. The anticipated period of performance is for a base period of twelve (12) months with four one year option periods.  A fixed price contract is anticipated.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is a Request for Proposal (RFP) currently available.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  In the absence of responses from interested firms demonstrating their capability and lack of conflict of interest, NHTSA intends to request a proposal from Claritas, Inc., on a noncompetitive basis for the work described.  Responses must be received by the listed procuring office within 15 calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.  Oral expressions of interest will not be considered.

U.S. GOVERNMENT, through the FEMA Group Site Acquisition Process (GSAP)seeks parcels of cleared land for approximately 18,000 temporary housing units for individuals and households displaced from their permanent residences by Hurricane Katrina.<br><br>
REQUIREMENTS:</b><br><br>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Group Site Acquisition Process (GSAP) has a Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) advertisement for parcels of land.  FEMA is seeking expressions of interest from owners of vacant parcels of land within the Parish of Orleans in Louisiana.  General Services Administration (GSA) will enter into a lease contract on behalf of FEMA with owners whose parcels of land are technically acceptable for the intended use of the Government.<br><br>
The intended use of the leased land is to provide approximately 18,000 temporary housing units to individuals and households displaced from their permanent residences by Hurricane Katrina.  FEMA’s Louisiana Housing Task Force is implementing a federal program to develop and operate temporary housing sites in the referenced Louisiana Parish.  The selected sites will be developed, maintained and operated by qualified contractors.  The Louisiana Housing Task Force Program is a joint state and federally operated plan for temporary housing assistance.  For more information on this program, please contact FEMA Individual Assistance at 1-800-621-FEMA or visit the website at www.fema.gov/rrr/inassist.shtm.<br><br>
FEMA intends to lease only the land that is determined to meet all the governments’ technical requirements.  The determination of technical acceptability is made by the GSA Contracting Officer.  The GSA Contracting Officer will use technical criteria provided by FEMA program officials, other federal agencies’ guidelines and technical contractors who are responsible for construction, operation and maintenance of the sites in making a determination.  The determination process is two-phased.  The first phase will use the criteria listed in this ad to determine if expressions of interest meet the minimum criteria for intended use by the government.  Those persons responding with an expression of interest that meets these minimum criteria will be provided with a Solicitation for Offer (SFO).  The second phase of determination is based upon the additional technical requirements specified within the SFO.  Only the offers that meet all the technical requirements of both this ad and the Solicitation for Offer will be considered for award.<br><br>
Land owners who meet the following minimum criteria are requested to provide expressions of interest to GSA:<br><br>
- Parcels of land no smaller than one half (1/2) acre and no larger than 100 acres in size<br>
- Land that is cleared of trees, debris and other impediments to construction<br>
- Land that has direct access from primary/secondary paved roads and with a minimum of 200 feet frontage on these roads<br>
- Land that is not in the flood plain<br>
- Land that is not wetlands<br>
- Land that is no further than 200 feet from water, sewerage and electric service<br>
- Land that is no further than 5 miles from schools, food service, and medical/police/ fire<br>
- Land that meets local government ordinances, zoning requirements and any other necessary approvals for the government's intended use<br>
- Land that complies with all necessary environmental, archeological and historical regulations<br><br>
The expression of interest should include as a minimum the following information:<br><br>
1) Owner’s name, address, phone number, email address if available<br>
2) Written proof of ownership and/or of the legal control necessary to lease the land<br>
3) Description of the land: size, physical characteristics and current use<br>
4) Location of the land: including the physical address, city & parish, and a small map<br>
5) Picture of the site<br>

<DESC>The NATO Joint Force Command Brunssum (JFC Brunssum) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on an annual contract for the regular maintenance of Unclassified and NS LAN (1 year contract plus two one-year options) for all JRC Brunssum installations.

JFC Brunssum is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. JFC Brunssum intends to use the two envelope bidding procedure. 

The estimated value of this project is not available. The reference for this project is IFIB-ACO-BRU-06-47 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

ELIGIBILITY

The IFIB package will contain material classified up to the level of NATO SECRET. Firms must possess facility and personnel clearances at the secret level in order to bid on this project. 
 
BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

The Host Nation will add those firms that are declared eligible to bid on this ICB project to its electronic distribution list. When the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) is issued, those firms will be notified by the Host Nation directly.

As provided for under MBC rules, however, nominations from interested firms will continue to be accepted by the Host Nation after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Deadline to be placed on the electronic bidder distribution list: 28 June 2006

2. Planned release date of the Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB): beginning of July 2006

3. Planned Bid Closing Date: 4 September 2006

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis, services for the Evaluation of the Protective Effect of Recombinant Cytokine Vaccine against Intravenous Challenge with Monkeypox (Zaire strain) Virus in Cynomolgus Macaques with Southern Research Institute, 431 Aviation Way, Frederick, Maryland 21701.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

Development of safer and efficacious vaccines for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Category A pathogen, smallpox remains one of the highest priorities of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biodefense Research Agenda.  Consistent with the goals of the Biodefense Research Agenda of NIH, this study was undertaken by the NCI to develop a safer and more immunogenic vaccine candidate against smallpox.  The proposed vaccine would be more suited for contemporary populations with greater numbers of immune-suppressed individuals, by integrating IL-2 and IL-15 into the genomes of currently licensed Dryvax (Wyeth) vaccinia strain and MVA virus thus generating 4 recombinant vaccine candidates (WyethIL-2, Wyeth IL-15, MVAIL-2 and MVAIL-15).  The required monkeypox virus challenge can only be done in BSL-3 facilities (Biosafety Level 3), and the facility must be able to house NCI-owned monkeys at BSL-3

Southern Research Institute is the only source known to the NCI that can evaluate potency and efficacy of smallpox vaccine candidates in non-human primates. They have performed multiple studies of monkeypox virus challenges in cohorts of monkeys vaccinated with experimental smallpox vaccines and are located within one (1) hour drive from the NIH/NCI.  In addition, they have many years of experience in performing the specialized real time poly chain reaction (PCR) assays required for this study.  Changing variables at this time would be detrimental to the current research in progress.
   
This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Contractor shall provide one (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on June 30, 2006.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed or emailed to the following: Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  It is the vendors’ responsibility to ensure all questions have been received in the contracting office.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference: NCI-60085-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following: Engineering and Technical Support for the Dryden Flight Research Center research aircraft including two F15 and two F-18 aircraft and other operations support aircraft.	The test bed aircraft (F15’s and F-18’s) are modified with research instrumentation systems and other capabilities for flying research projects.  In addition NASA may provide research systems for the Air Force operated C-17.  NASA plans to use the test aircraft for development and flight demonstration of a number of aerospace, controls and systems experiments.  In addition to the test aircraft, there are support aircraft are operated for pilot proficiency, chase, and other flight operations functions.  NASA plans to conduct Propulsion Controlled Aircraft (PCA) research involving a C-32 class aircraft. Other Boeing aircraft may be operated or be included in DFRC research activities during the life of this contract. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the above services directly from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company, of Saint Louis, Missouri St. Louis, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C 2304 (c) (1), “Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements”. Justification is based upon Boeing’s unique and proprietary capabilities to provide the required services involving the F/A-18, F-15, C-17, and other Dryden operated aircraft, which Boeing designed, built, and extensively tested. Boeing possesses the detailed knowledge of all aspects of these vehicles, which is unavailable to another firm.  The DFRC test aircraft are unique one of a kind custom modified vehicle in which standard modification drawings do not necessarily apply.  Boeing has the proprietary specification and drawings, as well as unique personnel with the knowledge and history on these aircraft.	Boeing has unique experience in the manufacture of the aircraft modifications made to the test aircraft.  Award to any other source would result in a failure to meet Agency’s requirements.   The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested organization may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. PDT on July 31, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Capabilities and qualification statements may be faxed or e-mailed.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is in the process of issuing a Request for Quotations (RFQ) Q6C5AAC0023 in support of the HUD Headquarters, Office of Economic Analysis (OEA), Economic and Market Analysis Division (EMAD).  This procurement is for a fixed-price contract under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) not to exceed $100,000, to examine the utility model developed for HUD, which must be modified to improve the energy consumption and temperature relationship.  This simple linear regression relationship between energy consumption and temperature (heating degree days) currently in the model will be replaced with a stepwise linear regression algorithm.  In the most recent work conducted on this model, energy consumption was determine to be overestimated in warm areas, and underestimated in cold areas. Two separate equations will be used, depending on the overall temperature of the area. These equations will be validated based on existing studies of energy usage.  The proposed Purchase Order is for the study to be completed within 6 months.  This solicitation is set aside for small business concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541720 with a small business size standard of 6.5 million.  

The anticipated posting date for the solicitation is scheduled for July 3, 2006. The RFQ will be released electronically. The RFQ and any amendments, updates, questions, answers, and changes to the posted information will be available at the following websites: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, and the HUD Current Contracting Opportunities Website: http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpo/contract.cfm.

Technical support will include assistance in fulfilling obligations to comply with OMB Circular A-130 and the Department of Interior (DOI) Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Program and other appropriate laws, directives, policies, standards, and guidelines.   ++++Under current Federal C&A requirements, an Information Technology (IT) system is required to undergo a formal authorization process at least once every three years or when major modifications occur.  The DOI C&A Guide provides a standardized approach to obtaining an authorization to operate for DOI Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) IT systems undergoing the C&A actions required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III requirements.  The formal C&A process, with associated documentation, provides evidence of a risk-based methodology that complies with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance (i.e., 800-53, FIPS 199, 800-18, 800-26, 800-30, 800-34, 800-37) and other Federal regulations.  This process will help define measures of performance used to assure adequate IT system security controls are implemented and tested, risks are assessed, and security plans are maintained.  ++++The successful offeror will provide C&A support to meet the requirements of the DOI C&A Program as described in the DOI C&A Guide, NIST 800-53, NIST  800-53A, FIPS 199, NIST 800-60, NIST 800-26,  OISP-2005-002 (Indian Affairs Interim Approval to Operate (IATO) Document Procedures), OISP-2005-001 (Indian Affairs Certification and Accreditation Document Procedures), DOI POAM Guidelines, BIA/OISP POAM Processes and Procedures.

INDIAN PREFERENCE ALSO APPLIES TO THIS ACQUISITION AS TO SUBCONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR NATIVE AMERICAN VENDORS.  IF YOU ARE ONLY A STATE RECOGNIZED TRIBAL ENTITY, YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT SINCE STATE RECOGNIZED TRIBAL ENTITIES ARE NOT FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED, THEREBY NOT FALLING UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE BUY INDIAN ACT.   FURTHER, GIVEN THAT THIS PROCUREMENT IS A BUY INDIAN SET ASIDE, UNFORTUNATELY STATE RECOGNIZED TRIBAL 8(A) AFFILIATED BUSINESSES (AS RECOGNIZED UNDER THE SBA’S 8(A) PROGRAM) ARE ALSO NOT ELIGIBLE. ++++ALL PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THE INFORMATION YOU RECEIVE FROM MR.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Economics Branch (CEB) in Washington, DC intends to award a Purchase Order to Ohio State University's Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Developmental Economics, of Columbus OH, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Under this purchase order, the contractor shall provide current analysis from a peer reviewed analytical tool of global detailed agriculture and forestry sector land-use activity, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon  sequestration.  Furthermore, the contractor shall: 1) Develop a combined forest and agriculture secytoral model for detailed analysis of global net GHG emissions and mitigation across the forest and agriculture sectors, 2) Develop the forest sector of a global dynamic general equilibrium model; and  3) Implement, evaluate, and revise the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) land-use forestry database.  These analyses are needed for global GHG inventories, soil, and forest carbon sequestration estimates, comprehensive forest and agricultural mitigation assessment, and land-use impact analysis.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620.    NO SOLICITATIONS OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   It has been determined that Ohio State University is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement as the Global Timber Model  (GTM) is maintained by one of it's staff.  The GTM, invaluable in this project, is regarded as the premier economic model for global forest carbon sequestration analysis.  This model captures the complex biophysical and economic dynamics of forest management with a forward-looking model of world  timber markets that considers future timber and land prices in managing timber stocks.  Furthermore, within the field of international forestry modeling, no other US research or consulting group has equivalent expertise in estimating the potential for carbon sequestration from global forests, nor  the detailed forest data stratified by land-cover and age-class cohorts and agro-ecological zones.  No other group has such a highly regarded, and dynamic, economic model as the GTM, which takes into account the necessary international timber trade and temporal aspects of global forest management  and carbon sequestration. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement may be considered.  Responses to posting must be in writing and submitted to  Nicole Humphrey, Contract Specialist at humphrey.nicole@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   In accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS with Nikon Instruments to manufacture a confocal microscope with spectral analysis capability for imaging living cells.  Within the division of the National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory (NHEERL) within Human Studies Division (HSD) scientific investigators conduct cell and molecular studies with a special interest of the effects of PM and PM component on signaling processes that occur at the cell membrane and are transduced  to the nucleus. The nature of this acquisition requires an instrument that possesses the unique capabilities of fast, high-sensitivity, high resolution spectral confocal imaging of fluorescence in living cells. This instrument requires the capabilities of multiple spectral resolutions over a 300nm  acquisition range (or better) and a spectral acquisition time of two ( 2)  seconds per 512 x 512 32- channel frame (or better) are essential to producing optimal clarity that capture short-lived intracellular events associated with the potential effects of environmental agents in living cells.  These unique capabilities are essential for  performance because they permit study of fleeting molecular and biochemical changes induced by the environmental stimuli in living cells.  The instrument shall offer compatibility with intensity calibration with a NIST traceable standard, a separate  fiber optically-coupled detection unit, a design  feature that takes into account  inherently superior sensitivity when compared to integrated designs. Based on EPA's research knowledge of the inverted microscope industry, combined internet searches of comparing available product information from  confocal microscopy manufacturers, confirm that Nikon is the only vendor that can meet the required instrument adaptable and expandable confocal imaging capabilities that are used to conduct mechanistic studies on the effects of ambient pollutants on human cells. However, any firm believing itself  capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A  determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact with 15 days of the posting of this notice. Interested parties should submit a written  request to Yvonne Harris (513) 487-2107 (fax) or e-mail harris.yvonne@epa.gov to receive consideration for this procurement. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>CMS intends to award a 26-month cost reimbursement contract, with two options periods, to one or more small business(s) to assist CMS in performing data processing and medical reviews for the Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) projects.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Potential offerors are hereby advised that their accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and that FAR Clause 52.219-14 and that Limitations of Subcontracting will be incorporated into the solicitation and resultant contract.  

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541513.  This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  

BACKGROUND: CMS must estimate payment error rates in Medicaid and SCHIP as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002 (Public Law 107-300).  The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the amount of improper payments, and report those estimates to Congress on an annual basis.  The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts.

CMS will use a contracting strategy to implement the Medicaid and SCHIP PERM program, which includes reviewing fee-for-service claims and managed care capitation payments.  This strategy will engage multiple contractors including a statistical contractor (being procured in a separate procurement), and

(A) A Medicaid documentation/database contractor (DDC), and 
(B) A SCHIP DDC, 
(C) A Medicaid review contractor (RC), and
(D) A SCHIP RC

The solicitation may allow Offeror(s) to bid on this work in the following four areas (1) Medicaid DDC; (2) SCHIP DDC; (3) Medicaid RC or (4) SCHIP RC or any combination of the four.

The statistical contractor will perform all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions for the Medicaid and SCHIP Programs.  The DDC will gather and maintain medical policies and corresponding quarterly updates from states, and will collect and maintain medical records from providers.  The RC will gather and maintain the data processing manuals, will use the collected policies and medical records to perform medical and data processing reviews; put into place a difference resolution process for the state to dispute the contractor’s findings; provide its findings to the statistical contractor; jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor; and submit the report to CMS.  

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS: The successful documentation/database contract offeror(s) shall coordinate, collect, and maintain all state Medicaid and/or SCHIP policies and/or manuals necessary to conduct medical reviews.  This process will also include the collection, on a quarterly basis, and maintenance of all state policy updates related to medical or payment policy.  The policies and corresponding updates will appear in a variety of formats (e.g., via website, electronic PDF format, and hardcopy).  The offeror shall have the knowledge and means to manipulate the policy formats for uniformity and relative ease of use by the reviewers.  The offeror(s) shall maintain all state Medicaid and/or SCHIP policies in a central housing unit that will be accessed by the reviewers when conducting medical reviews and data processing reviews.  

The successful documentation/database contract offeror(s) shall also coordinate, request, obtain, scan and upload medical records for the sampled claims.  This process will include contacting the providers, and requesting and receiving the medical records associated with the sampled claims.  The offeror shall maintain all medical records in a central housing unit that will be accessed by the reviewers when conducting medical reviews.  

The offeror shall be advised that the size and length of each policy will vary.  The offeror shall be prepared to coordinate efforts to obtain policies and quarterly updates of the policies for 17 Medicaid states and/or 17 SCHIP states.  The offeror shall also be prepared to handle approximately 800 – 1200 sampled fee-for-service claims and medical records, or an average of 1000 sampled claims and medical records, for each state. The sampling unit is defined as an individually priced service (e.g., a physician office visit or a hospital stay).  The sampling unit may be a claim or line item. 

The successful review contract offeror(s) shall make a payment determination for each sampling unit by performing data processing reviews and medical reviews.  The offeror shall review each sampling unit to determine if it was processed through the claims payment system correctly, medically necessary, coded correctly and properly paid or denied.  The offeror shall validate whether each sampling unit was paid correctly based on: information found on the claim, the information in the medical record, the information in the claims processing system, and state policies.  

For the managed care initiative, the review contract offeror shall conduct a data processing review of approximately 500 managed care capitation payments for each of the 17 states. The offeror will provide its review findings to the states and the statistical contractor; maintain a difference resolution process; jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor; and submit the report to CMS.  

The offeror(s) shall perform this work for one complete production cycle, which is a 26-month period. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal in late May 2006/early June 2006 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) order under BOA number N00019-05-G-0008 for services and engineering support necessary for the integration of the Tomahawk All Up Round (AUR) capability into the SSGN Class Nuclear Submarine.  This effort includes the systems engineering; system configuration drawing review; a detailed engineering review of the interfaces between the AUR and the SSGN/Multiple AUR Canister (MAC) Launcher and the SSGN Weapon Control System; review and comment on the preliminary change notices documentation; and associated program management supporting these efforts.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Company, P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, Arizona 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, Raytheon has been the sole developer, designer and manufacturer for the Tomahawk AUR.  Raytheon solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk AUR missile.  Raytheon currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk missile is required to perform the services and engineering support necessary for the integration of the Tomahawk AUR capability into the SSGN Class Nuclear Submarine, Raytheon is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source contract with the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC), 3201 New Mexico Avenue, Suite 330, Washington, DC 20016.  AAPCC is the association of the 63 poison control centers in the United States and as such receives data concerning 2.2 million poison exposures annually from U.S. poison control centers.  This poisoning data is updated every 4-10 minutes, 24 hours a day.  Toxicologists, epidemiologists, and statisticians at AAPCC and CDC (NCEH/EHHE/HSB) have developed and continually modify categories of information collected by the national poisonings data system to analyze for aberration detection.

The Contractor, as an independent agent and not as an agent of the government, shall provide CDC with data about poisonings from the Poison Control Centers (PCCs) (i.e., call volume, clinical effect data, and specific substance data) for use in CDC toxicosurveillance and notification of public health officials of aberrations.  The Contractor shall provide real-time toxicosurveillance data in a manner that meets or exceeds CDC security requirements established by the Public Health Information Network (PHIN).  The software and hardware used to collect national poisonings data will be flexible enough to eventually allow for the uploading of, or ensure the accuracy of coding for, text fields from the PCC record; is compatible with the four data entry platforms currently being used by the PCCs; and can be modified as CDC’s data needs grow and change.  The system and the data collected will be continually reviewed and evaluated collaboratively by the Contractor and CDC toxicology and surveillance experts so that data quality and utility is improved.  All work performed under this contract is done so under guidelines and limitations set forth in the executed licensing agreement(s).  So that progress can be monitored, the Contractor shall provide quarterly reports to CDC.  Reports will describe the progress of each activity, as well as the costs associated with that progress.

Technical Requirements  
The Contractor shall:
1. Complete initial rebuild of national poisoning data system, ensuring CDC access to data, compliance with CDC security and technology specifications, and system redundancies to protect the data.  
2. Continue to review 10-20 aberrations detected in the regularly monitored exposure data and provide subject matter expertise interpretation and resolution of the aberration as appropriate.  This activity is the daily operation and purpose of the national poisoning data system for CDC.
3. Expand the current capability of national poisoning data so it can be utilized by GIS software applications and will purchase the software to allow creation of visual display of national poisoning data.
4. Develop a database and track the details about alerts issued by the national poisoning data system, including origin, follow-up actions, contacts, and resolution.  
5. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to expand their surveillance capabilities and improve their ability to detect aberrations at the local level.  The proposed activity will replicate and expand the national aberrancy detection algorithms at 3 local PCCs; the evaluation will compare detection of anomalies at the local level versus the national level.
6. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to: a) develop a database to track the details (e.g., origin, follow-up actions, contacts, resolution) about aberrations that their local detection systems identify; and b) compare their anomalies with PCC surveillance to determine whether there is any added public health benefit in conducting surveillance on the local level in addition to national surveillance.   The PCC tracking databases will be compared for sensitivity and specificity to the databases developed by AAPCC for national aberration detection.  
7. Facilitate evaluation activity at local poison control centers to evaluate the quality of the data that is uploaded to the national poisoning data system by comparing the coded variables (available at a national level) to the more comprehensive text data that is entered and stored at the local level.  PCCs will pull records of past calls and use fellow and/or local staff to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the codes entered into the national data system to capture information recorded in the text fields.
8. Facilitate an evaluation activity local poison control centers to test the ability of the system to detect a staged chemical event.  PCCs to conduct a “mock event” whereby poisoning data is planted in those PCC’s data and sent to AAPCC’s national poisoning data system.  The evaluation will determine the sensitivity of the national poisoning data system to detect the “event”.
9. Facilitate a survey of PCC and other public health officials about their understanding of the role and function of clinical toxicology in the public health setting.  
10. Provide one staff person at each poison control center access to training and/or training materials about the new national poisoning data system.

Reporting Schedule – At 4, 8 and 12 months after contract award, the Contractor shall provide progress report describing expenditures to date, number and nature of aberrations, number of outbreaks or real events detected, resolution of aberrations, and upgrades to the hardware and software.

The Statutory Authorities permitting other than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.     Interested parties may submit a statement of qualifications and experience which, if timely received, will be evaluated by CDC to determine if a competitive solicitation should be issued.     Inquires must be received by June 30, 2006, at 4:00PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Collect calls will not be accepted.  Responses may be E-mailed to Charlene Allison at fkk1@cdc.gov.  Questions regarding this proposed acquisition may be directed to Charlene Allison, Contract Officer, 770-488-2841.

<DESC>CMS intends to award a 26-month cost reimbursement contract, with two options periods, to one or more small business(s) to assist CMS in performing data processing and medical reviews for the Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) projects.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Potential offerors are hereby advised that their accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and that FAR Clause 52.219-14 and that Limitations of Subcontracting will be incorporated into the solicitation and resultant contract.  

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541513.  This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  

BACKGROUND: CMS must estimate payment error rates in Medicaid and SCHIP as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002 (Public Law 107-300).  The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the amount of improper payments, and report those estimates to Congress on an annual basis.  The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts.

CMS will use a contracting strategy to implement the Medicaid and SCHIP PERM program, which includes reviewing fee-for-service claims and managed care capitation payments.  This strategy will engage multiple contractors including a statistical contractor (being procured in a separate procurement), and

(A) A Medicaid documentation/database contractor (DDC), and 
(B) A SCHIP DDC, 
(C) A Medicaid review contractor (RC), and
(D) A SCHIP RC

The solicitation may allow Offeror(s) to bid on this work in the following four areas (1) Medicaid DDC; (2) SCHIP DDC; (3) Medicaid RC or (4) SCHIP RC or any combination of the four.

The statistical contractor will perform all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions for the Medicaid and SCHIP Programs.  The DDC will gather and maintain medical policies and corresponding quarterly updates from states, and will collect and maintain medical records from providers.  The RC will gather and maintain the data processing manuals, will use the collected policies and medical records to perform medical and data processing reviews; put into place a difference resolution process for the state to dispute the contractor’s findings; provide its findings to the statistical contractor; jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor; and submit the report to CMS.  

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS: The successful documentation/database contract offeror(s) shall coordinate, collect, and maintain all state Medicaid and/or SCHIP policies and/or manuals necessary to conduct medical reviews.  This process will also include the collection, on a quarterly basis, and maintenance of all state policy updates related to medical or payment policy.  The policies and corresponding updates will appear in a variety of formats (e.g., via website, electronic PDF format, and hardcopy).  The offeror shall have the knowledge and means to manipulate the policy formats for uniformity and relative ease of use by the reviewers.  The offeror(s) shall maintain all state Medicaid and/or SCHIP policies in a central housing unit that will be accessed by the reviewers when conducting medical reviews and data processing reviews.  

The successful documentation/database contract offeror(s) shall also coordinate, request, obtain, scan and upload medical records for the sampled claims.  This process will include contacting the providers, and requesting and receiving the medical records associated with the sampled claims.  The offeror shall maintain all medical records in a central housing unit that will be accessed by the reviewers when conducting medical reviews.  

The offeror shall be advised that the size and length of each policy will vary.  The offeror shall be prepared to coordinate efforts to obtain policies and quarterly updates of the policies for 17 Medicaid states and/or 17 SCHIP states.  The offeror shall also be prepared to handle approximately 800 – 1200 sampled fee-for-service claims and medical records, or an average of 1000 sampled claims and medical records, for each state. The sampling unit is defined as an individually priced service (e.g., a physician office visit or a hospital stay).  The sampling unit may be a claim or line item. 

The successful review contract offeror(s) shall make a payment determination for each sampling unit by performing data processing reviews and medical reviews.  The offeror shall review each sampling unit to determine if it was processed through the claims payment system correctly, medically necessary, coded correctly and properly paid or denied.  The offeror shall validate whether each sampling unit was paid correctly based on: information found on the claim, the information in the medical record, the information in the claims processing system, and state policies.  

For the managed care initiative, the review contract offeror shall conduct a data processing review of approximately 500 managed care capitation payments for each of the 17 states. The offeror will provide its review findings to the states and the statistical contractor; maintain a difference resolution process; jointly write the final report with the statistical contractor; and submit the report to CMS.  

The offeror(s) shall perform this work for one complete production cycle, which is a 26-month period. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal in late May 2006/early June 2006 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>This is not a Request for proposal and the Government will not pay for any information requested in this Request For Information (RFI).  Responses will be done at no cost to the Government.  The government is contemplating a firm fixed price type of contract to fulfill this requirement.  Initial research indicates this service is commercial in nature and we are soliciting beneficial commercial practices, terms and conditions for consideration.  It will be the contractor’s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions in any resultant Request for Proposal and awarded contract.
The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is responsible for the management and operation of thirteen Air Force Bases located in several southern states.  Three of AETC’s bases are located in the electrically deregulated part of Texas: Sheppard AFB near Wichita Falls, TX, Goodfellow AFB near San Angelo, TX, and Laughlin AFB near Del Rio, TX.  These bases have an aggregated energy requirement of approximately 225,000 Megawatt Hours per year and a peak demand of approximately 45 Megawatts.  For these bases, AETC is interested in developing an aggregated electric supply solution.  AETC is considering the use of a special purpose Retail Electric Provider (REP).  AETC believes that a special purpose REP will create opportunities for AETC to more economically manage its forward supply needs utilizing a portfolio purchasing method that will allow further opportunities for AETC to purchase a mix of generation types (traditional and renewable fuels), while lending flexibility for the purchase of unique renewable resources (i.e., solar, landfill gas, wind, municipal solid waste).  Purchases of renewable energy resources are required under the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.  To achieve these objectives AETC wishes to identify an Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market participant that is a registered Retail Electric Provider.
As part of Market Research, this Request for Information (RFI) will be used to determine if there is more than one Retail Energy Provider (REP) capable of providing the services described above.  Also, based on the responses to this RFI a determination of suitability for small business set aside will be made.
The North American Industry System Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 221122 with a maximum size standard for small business designation of 4 million megawatt hours per year.  Once Market Research has been completed, the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be placed on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  It will be the responsibility of prospective offerors’ to check this site regularly for any postings or changes.  Prospective offerors’ must be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Registration (CCR) and must be qualified to perform in the correct NAICS code as aforementioned.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  All prospective offerors’ shall indicate their size standard (large business, small business, 8a, HUBZone, SDB/8(a), SD-VOSB, VOSB, WOSB, etc.) when replying to this RFI.  Provide a single point-of-contact to include an e-mail address, your Federal Cage Code, and your Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.  This is not a request for offers or proposals.  This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract.  

Through the preservation and modernization of an historic federal building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values. 

The General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast and Caribbean Region is seeking highly qualified Architectural/Engineering (A/E) firms interested in participating in a potential opportunity under GSA’s Design Excellence Program.  The acquisition procedures for this opportunity will be in accordance with the Design Excellence quality standards and requirements.  This will be a negotiated procurement issued in accordance with Public Law 92-582, “The Brooks Act.”  In this process the Government will award to the most highly qualified A/E Team with whom it can negotiate a fair and reasonable price.  

This sources sought identifies a potential A/E Design services acquisition for Façade Repair and Slate Roof Replacement of the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, 271 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, NY.  The Estimated Construction Cost Range for this project is between $45,000,000 and $55,000,000.

The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is an historic structure located in the Civic Center of the Borough of Brooklyn, New York.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark.  The 575,000 gross square foot building occupies an entire city block, fronting on Cadman Plaza, a major public space around which many federal, state and municipal buildings are organized.  The building houses the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Postal Service.  Originally constructed as a Post Office and Courthouse in 1892, the building was enlarged in 1933.  The earlier, four-story (plus attic) structure that occupies the southern end of the site was designed by Mifflin Bell, then Supervising Architect of the Treasury, and is Romanesque Revival in style.  The exterior facades are built of granite-faced masonry, embellished with carved ornament, dormers and turrets.  The eight-story 1933 addition that occupies the balance of the site was undertaken under the direction of James Wetmore, Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury.  In designing the addition, great effort was made to emulate the appearance of the 1892 structure.  While many architectural details are shared by both structures, the 1933 structure incorporated the use of terra cotta cladding, in lieu of granite, above the first floor.  Above this level, the use of granite was limited to the stonework surrounding the second floor windows.

This project will involve the replacement of nearly all the deteriorated terra cotta cladding on the facades of the 1933 structure with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials, restoration of all existing granite cladding on both buildings, and replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system on both structures.   The entire complex will remain fully occupied throughout the construction period.  The design will follow the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Building Preservation Plan (BPP) guidance, respecting the historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements to correct the deficiencies in the exterior envelope of the building and to preclude further façade deterioration and damage to the structure and the recently renovated historic interior.

This building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark.  Each design submission must be approved by the Regional Historic Preservation Officer, who will coordinate external review by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 106.  As deemed necessary during the design and final documents preparation process, and at a minimum for the Pre-Design submission, the A/E will include a preservation report with captioned photographs and relevant design details identifying preservation design issues and proposed solutions.  A Memorandum of Agreement with the SHPO, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation is already in place.

The design responsibilities will include, but are not necessarily limited to, architectural historic preservation as related to the following items of work: replacement of nearly all of the existing deteriorated terra cotta masonry with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials on the facades of the 1933 structure;  retention, restoration and cleaning of existing terra cotta at window surrounds wherever possible; repair, cleaning and re-pointing of the existing granite cladding on the facades of both the 1892 and 1933 structures;  hazardous materials removal;  replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system and associated lead coated copper gutters, flashing, valleys and ridges on both the 1892 and 1933 structures;  and installation of a fall prevention system at the slate mansard roof to facilitate periodic maintenance of perimeter gutters and drains. 

The Scope of A/E Services under this anticipated acquisition will include, but are not necessarily limited to: Field Inspections, Surveys, Examinations, Sampling and Testing, Documentation, Architectural/Engineering Design, Preparation of Specifications and CAD drawings for Construction Documents, Value Engineering, Partnering, Cost Estimating and Interior Design/Space Planning for temporary tenant relocations.  Optional Construction Phase services will include, but may not be limited to:  Partnering, Post Construction Contract Services (PCCS), Construction Inspection Services (CIS), As-Built Drawings and other related services.  The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for the Public Buildings Service), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements.

Subsequent to the selection of a highly qualified A/E firm, the Government anticipates awarding a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) contract.  The Government will select a CMc to serve as General Contractor providing pre-construction and construction services.  The CMc will provide design phase consultations evaluating costs, schedule, alternative design implications, building systems, and construction materials.  The Government will solicit proposals under a source selection process for CMc.  Selection will be based on a combination of technical and price factors that provide the best value to the Government. 

The Northeast and Caribbean Region is also seeking information on A/E firms that are experienced in Architectural and Historic Preservation and qualify under the 8(a) Program, the HUBZone Program and/or the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Procurement Program.  The North American Industry Classification System Code for this potential acquisition is 541310.  The Small Business size standard is average annual sales and receipts for the past three years that are less than $4,500,000.00.

<DESC>The Nacimiento Copper Mine Site Operable Unit 2 is located in Sandoval County, 3.5 miles southeast of Cuba in northwest New Mexico on State Highway 126.  In the 1980s, over 250,000 gallons of sulfuric and ferric acid was injected into the Agua Zarca aquifer to extract cooper. The acid was left in place resulting in the average pH of 3.59 and heavy metals above New Mexico State standards. This remedial action will pump contaminated ground water from the aquifer, surface treat it and release it into an unnamed channel. 

The project will pump up to 120 gallons per minute of groundwater via a series of new extraction wells to the surface.  This water shall be treated using a semi-passive alcohol-enhanced bioreactor system (SPAEBS).  The SPAEBS will utilize biological cultures to remove metals to the more stringent of New Mexico applicable groundwater and surface water standards.  The treated water shall be discharged through an engineered drainage channel armored with riprap to prevent erosion and sediment transport and to provide aeration to surface water drainage.  The main components of the required system are as follows:

GROUND WATER EXTRACTION SYSTEM
„X	Nine extraction wells 
„X	One new monitoring well
„X	Two 3,000 gallon above ground storage tanks
„X	Supply pumps
„X	Level control alarm system
„X	Piping from the extraction wells to the storage tanks and to the SPAEBS
„X	Supply pumps
SPAEBS
„X	Sodium hydroxide feed system, including 3,000 gallon tank and two metering pumps
„X	Lined settling pond, 15 feet deep - 140 long and 100 feet wide
„X	Ethanol feed system, including 3,000 gallon tank 
„X	Nitrogen feed shed
„X	Lined bioreactor - 15 feet deep, 70 feet long and 200 feet wide
„X	Recycle loop, including piping and recycle pump
„X	Chemical supply alarm system
EFFLUENT DISCHARGE SYSTEM
„X	Discharge pipe
„X	Limestone lined discharge channel

The operation and maintenance of this system for one year, with three option years is included.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications especially from, but not limited to, various members of the Small Business Community (Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, to include 8(a),  Veteran/Service-Disabled Owned Small Business Concerns, and all other identified Small Business Concerns).  
The Washington Headquarters Services, Acquisition and Procurement Office is seeking  qualified, experienced, sources to provide professional conference planning and subject matter expertise in the area of educational transformation to support the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Office of Force Transformation/Transformation Chairs meeting requirements.

 Background: The Director, Office of Force Transformation (OFT), is an advocate for transformation within the Department of Defense (DoD) and serves as a catalyst for initiating new concepts and exploring new technologies that could play key roles in transforming our military and the Department.  The challenge for OFT was how to contribute to the emergence of a culture that would accept, embrace, implement, and expand transformation.  One of the major challenges to transformation is developing leaders with abilities to size, shape, operate, and change the force.  Leaders in the Information Age must be competent in areas beyond the traditional objects of professional military education:  competence in leading people in executing a mission or an institution in fulfilling its goals and objectives. They must also be competent to foster a climate of innovation, encourage and implement change, and direct experimentation to discover effective solutions to complex problems that emerge rapidly and unexpectedly.  Moreover, Information Age leaders must understand the new dynamics of network centric operations (NCO) so they can translate an information advantage derived from robust networks, shared situational awareness, and understanding of commander’s intent into a decisive warfighting advantage characterized by self-synchronization, speed of command and increased combat power.  From this idea was born the Education for Transformation Initiative.

More than a dozen Transformation Chairs have been established at major DoD educational institutions.  Functions include:  (1)  participation in a collaborative network of Transformation Educators embracing U.S. governmental and non-governmental partners; Coalition partners, allies, industry, and academia;  (2)  serve as Authoritative Champion for Transformation Studies at DoD Educational Instutiontions, and institutional focal point for the Transformation Research Program; (3)  direct/coordinate original research; (4)  influence curriculum development; (5)  act as a focal point for transformation teaching and research on campus; and  (6) develop and deliver short courses..  Each quarter, a Transformation Chair meeting, lasting 2-3 days, is held at a DoD educational institution.
Sources Sought: The OFT is seeking comprehensive support for the Transformation Chairs’ Quarterly Conferences, to be held at a major DoD educational institution.  The objective is to ensure that each Transformation Chair Quarterly Conference is a seamless operation.  Additionally, the OFT requires subject matter expertise in the area of educational transformation to catalyze dialog within the EFT community, stimulate and support the sharing of institutional research  interests and efforts by faculty and students, and share information about conferences, workshops, and symposia with the EFT community.  A SECRET security clearance is required.  
Interested firms are requested to provide capability statements (not to exceed 8 pages) that include the following information:  (1)  Company Name, address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address; (2)  Business size status, (Large, Small, large, 8(A), etc)  (3) Company experience—where, when and for whom have you done this type of work before? (4)  Company experience --Provide a general discussion of your capabilities and demonstrate the capacity to perform the above stated requirement. 

Responses are due no later than 4:00 pm on Monday, June 26, 2006.

NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.

ALL RESPONSES AND QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED VIA E-MAIL.  TELEPHONIC REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATIONS AND/OR INFORMATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR RETURNED.  

The Government reserves the right to conduct oral capabilities demonstrations that will be scheduled at a later date.  

There is no commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract as a result of this notice.

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing JMETC Event Support.

SCOPE

This effort provides the 412 Test Wing (TW) access to Boeing Aircraft Hardware in the Loop (HITL) Labs and High Fidelity Aircraft Simulators, for platforms such as AWACS Block 30/35 and 40/45, F-15, and F-18, integrated into a distributed test environment.  412TW Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) assets will participate in a distributed test event in August 2006 for the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program.  The 412TW engineers would like to check out the mission flow, network data load, and link communication with command/control aircraft.  The contractor shall provide various mission-based Link 16 data and “ownship” data real-time to 412TW assets to help with this check out.  “Ownship” data is position and weapon system status data that is generated by the aircraft HITL Lab or simulator before it is packaged for transmission on Link-16. These HITL Labs and/or Simulators will be tasked to participate in defined test scenarios to support testing.  In these test scenarios these HITL Labs and/or simulators will be asked to send and receive link 16 data link messages per the scenario.  Message data will be compared with recorded HITL Lab and/or simulator transmitted and received data to verify message traffic between all systems within the network of LVC systems participating in the test.  The period of this effort is from 1 June 2006 to 1 Sept 2006.

1.0	DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

1.1	Simulation Assets:  The contractor shall provide access via a network to aircraft hardware in the loop and high fidelity simulators for use in distributed testing.

1.3	Network Connectivity:  The contractor shall provide the network connectivity required to link their simulators and Battlespace Environment to the AFFTC Data Acquisition and Transmission System (DATS).  The contractor shall ensure that all applicable network security paperwork from both DISA and SAF /AQ is complete and approved before connecting their network with the AFFTC network(s).  

1.4	Operations Support:  The contractor shall provide manning to operate its HITL Labs and/or simulators during NCW test events.  The operators shall operate the system according to defined mission scenarios.  Operator representatives shall participate in Technical Interchange Meeting teleconferences during the test planning phase to assist in the definition of test scenarios for a particular test.  Operators shall participate in Mission Pre-Briefs the day before a mission to ensure that there is an understanding of the test and receive any changes to the test mission.

1.5	Engineering and Technical Support:  The contractor shall provide engineering and technical support to ensure connectivity and data transfer.

1.6	Support Scheduling:   The contractor shall be required to support a test given two weeks notice.  The contractor shall have the flexibility to adjust to government requested unplanned test slips by 2 days without cancelling the support and re-scheduling.

<SUBJECT>C4ISR Mission Enablement Support
<DESC>This future opportunity announcement is to advise industry of the Governmentâ€™s intention to procure engineering services to support the SPAWAR System Center, Charlestonâ€™s (SSC Charlestonâ€™s) mission to enable knowledge superiority for the Joint Warfighter through the development, acquisition and life cycle support of effective, integrated C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance), IT (Information Technology), and Space capabilities. The acquisition will be a competitive, 8(a) set-aside, multiple award contract.  The contract type will be a combination of a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, and Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), performance-based, multiple award type contract.  The contract term is three-years (base year plus 2 one-year options) and the total potential value is estimated at $155.5M divided among all successful offerors.  However, please note that this will be an IDIQ contract, no orders or funding above the guaranteed minimum ($100K divided equally among all successful offerors) are guaranteed. Awards will be made on a Best Value basis to 8(a) offerors that posses a cumulative amount of $750K or more in recent corporate experience relevant to the SSC Charleston C4ISR mission, have satisfactory or better past performance and offer reasonable/realistic cost and price. After award, competitive award procedures for task orders will be preferred and encouraged.  However, based on the authority of FAR 6.302-5(b)(4), sole source award of task orders will be allowed.  Any one company will be allowed to receive up to a cumulative value of $3M in sole source orders.  After that point, companies that have reached the $3M ceiling will only be eligible for competitively processed orders. This acquisition supports emerging requirements as well as some existing and ongoing C4ISR initiatives promulgated by a variety of Navy, DOD, DHS and other organizations.  Our efforts require expertise within the full range of the C4ISR program support discipline, including:  Program, Project and Acquisition Management Support; Material and Equipment Procurement Support; Engineering and Testing Support; Integrated Logistics Support; Maintenance and Technical Support; Configuration Management Support; and Information Technology (IT) and Web Services Support.  The places of performance include the Charleston, SC and Tidewater VA areas, and other locations worldwide where services are needed. Please note that SSCC has a need for conflict of interest free program management services.  The contract Organizational Conflict of Interest Clause prohibits companies from performing program specific technical tasks influenced by program management tasking if they are already performing program management taskings on the same program. The goals of this acquisition include satisfying the need to provide SSC Charleston with rapid access to a broader range of relevant capabilities available within the 8(a) community, providing increased relevant business development opportunities for 8(a) companies, providing competition opportunities to better position companies to survive graduation from the 8(a) program, and decrease the direct and administrative costs to the government associated with obtaining these services.   All 8(a) companies with recent and relevant corporate experience and satisfactory past performance are highly encouraged to consider submitting proposals in response to the Request for Proposals when issued. .  The government also intends to issue a draft RFP that will be posted on the SPAWAR e-commerce website under the SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston Future Opportunities Section.  The government welcomes comments from industry concerning this draft RFP.  All comments concerning the draft RFP are to be provided in writing to the attention of Theresa Brutsch, Code 028TB, via e-mail to Theresa.Brutsch@navy.mil.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>The purpose of the modification to synopsis NB848000600129 is to change the solicitation from being a sole source to open competition and extends the response date to July 5, 2006. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.  The proposed contract is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334513 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires a flowing vapor cryostat. The cryostat system required shall cool a small sample to below 2 degrees Kelvin and hold it at that temperature for four hours. The sample will then be probed with a laser through four windows in the outer shell of the cryostat. This system shall use a liquid nitrogen Dewar surrounding a liquid helium Dewar. The liquid helium shall be metered through a valve and pass across the sample to be studied. Small heaters on the sample holder and on the liquid helium tube shall precisely control the temperature. The "tail", or sample end of the unit shall be approximately 8” (203.20 mm) long and have four windows that are less than or equal to 2.75” (69.85 mm) from outside face to outside face of the quartz windows. This feature is critical for this application because lenses to focus the laser beams must be close to the sample being studied. Three sets of windows shall be anti-reflective coated for transmission at 800 nm and one set for 400 nm. The four hour hold time below 2 degrees Kelvin is essential for the long run times of the experiments. NIST plans to build a rotating sample holder inside the cryostat so the cryostat shall have at least a .126” (3.20mm) hole down the center of the sample holder tube and through the sample mount which will allow NIST to actuate the rotating sample holder with a .125” (3.18mm)tube. The top of the sample holder tube must have an o-ring compression fitting on its top to seal this .125” (3.18mm) tube. The design of this cryostat must allow the sample to be immersed in liquid helium which is required for some experiments. The sample positioner tube must allow for rotation (on the vertical axis) and translation (along the vertical axis)of the sample and allow for quick sample changeover times (less than 5 min.) The sample tube which contains the liquid or vapor of helium shall be at least .950” (24.13 mm) I.D. the sample mount must be .75” (19.05 mm) copper. The sample mount shall have a silicon diode temperature sensor installed with an accuracy of ± 0.1 K and the control heater at the helium input tube shall have a silicon diode temperature sensor installed with an accuracy of ± 0.5 K. A temperature controller with connecting cable and liquid helium level sensor and display with connecting cable shall also be included. The cryostat shall have an adjustable position mounting flange, appropriate pump out flanges, safety pressure relief valve, and extra electrical feedthroughs for experiment leads. Delivery of the flowing vapor cryostat is required within 6 months after approval of drawings.   The government will award a fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer will represent the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  The evaluation criteria, in order of priority are: Bidders must provide references of experience with equipment of a similar application; Bidders must specify the liquid helium consumption rate for the 4 hour run time of their cryostat; Bidders must state the warranty period (a longer warranty is preferred); and bidders must provide the delivery time (a shorter delivery time is preferred). Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or e-mail.  Quotes are due before July 5, 2006. Please include delivery date, F.O.B. point, business size, Federal Taxpayer Identification Number, and Dun and Bradstreet Number. Vendors must also be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at "http://www.ccr.gov"
The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items – The government will award a fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer will represent the best value to the government, price and other factors considered;  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items – Offerors must include a completed copy of Offeror Representations and Certifications along with the offer;  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision;  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

STATEMENT OF WORK
TO GENERATE LOCKOUT/TAGOUT PROCEDURES                                    FOR 402 MXW 

1.0 SCOPE

This Statement of Work (SOW) provides a description of the services to be provided to the 402d MXW for the generation of a lockout/tagout procedure program.  

1.1 Introduction

This effort is required to ensure compliance with OSHA requirements for Lockout-Tagout (The Control of Hazardous Energy) procedures on a variety of equipment in the 402d Maintenance Group.  Lockout/tagout procedures are required for any equipment in the 402 MXW that the unexpected startup of the equipment, or release of stored energy, could cause injury to employees.  This effort would ensure compliance with OSHA standards and would also standardize the lockout/tagout procedures across the 402 MXW.  The resultant contract will provide graphical and written lockout/tagout procedures for each applicable piece of equipment and deliverable software to allow for future equipment processes to be added organically.   

A standard approach to lockout/tagout procedures is required across the 402d Maintenance Wing.  Graphical-machine specific procedures are the fastest means to establish a zero-energy state for any piece of equipment.  Machine mounted placards allow any authorized employee to safely and quickly control machinery, and prevent unexpected start up.  Each procedure must be visually instructive and provide color coded identification of energy and machine-control points.  This allows employees to de-energize machines, perform maintenance or set-up, and then return to production faster than any other lockout/tagout procedure style.  Implementation of this type of procedure will meet or exceed the requirements of OSHA Lockout/Tagout Standard, CFR 1910.147. 

2.0 REQUIREMENTS
 
2.1	The contractor shall perform a Zero Energy State Assessment of all equipment identified in attachment A, and determine the ability of each piece of equipment to arrive at a state of zero energy.

2.2	The contractor shall create effective, and easy to understand, graphical lockout procedures, using digital technology, for each piece of equipment referenced in the equipment list.

2.3	The contractor shall strategically install graphical procedures at optimal locations on the equipment, ensuring maximum usability and benefit.

2.4	The contractor shall create and install color-coded energy source tags at each lockout point to visually, safely and quickly direct authorized employees to the correct energy source.

2.5	The contractor shall provide electronic files and templates of the procedures and one binder with additional copies of the procedures.

2.6	The contractor will provide one training session on maintaining the files and software.

2.7	The contractor shall ensure that all procedures are compliant with OSHA CFR 1910.147.

2.8.   The procedure for obtaining an access control card for contractor personnel to work full time    in the Avionics & Instruments Division 640 Complex are as follows:

 The contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR), written request on company letterhead stationery to the 402d EMXG Visitor Control Center, 420 Richard Ray Blvd, STE 100, Robins AFB, GA  31098-1640 specifying:  contract number; location of work site; duration of visit, not to exceed 12 months; names of contractor (include subcontractor) employees requiring access to the base; the name of the individual, SSN, security clearance eligibility, clearance date and citizenship. VAR must be signed by the company FSO or management official, and forwarded 24 hours in advance to contract start date.   (VARs should be for unclassified visits only. Visit Authorization Letter (VAL),  IAW the NISPOM, are required for classified visits).  All contractor employees requiring entry into Avionics complex shall be United States citizens.

2.9	 Mission Essential Services:  Contractor services provided under this contract are designated as non- mission essential IAW DoDI 3020.37. The contractor is to be aware of the discontinuance of PWS requirements during a crisis situation.

Equipment listings and CDRLs are available via email:  lavelle.barnett@robins.af.mil

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-09.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is being competed on an unrestricted basis.  Therefore, all responsible parties may submit a quote.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Active Radioactive Materials (RAM) Waste Monitor.

***The contract line items (CLINS) for this procurement are:

CLIN 0001: Active Radioactive Materials (RAM) Waste Monitor for measurement and clearance of potentially contaminated items, Quantity:  1, Unit:  Each, which shall meet or exceed the following required specifications: 

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR CLIN 0001:
The monitor shall have a minimum capacity volume of 52 x 52 x 52 cm for clearing waste generated in the laboratory. The laboratory uses a variety of radiation sources, emission types, and energies including low energy X-ray (about 36 keV), high energy gamma (1.3 MeV) and moderate to high energy betas (50 keV to 1.7 MeV).  

Functional Requirements

The system shall consist of a minimum of 4 large area detectors to measure gamma emitting radionuclides, low energy X-ray, and high energy beta particles (presumably plastic scintilators). All of the detectors shall be arranged to maximize coverage of the interior surface of the chamber creating an approximately 4 pi detection geometry (at a minimum top, bottom, and sides). External background signal shall be suppressed by surrounding the detectors and counting chamber (top, bottom, sides, and door/s) with a minimum of 10mm of lead. Additionally the system shall be able to actively monitor the background when not in use and apply this background subtraction to determine net counting results. All computer displays, electronics, controls, indicator lights, keyboard/pad, shall allow the user to control and monitor the system. Count cycles shall be initiated either by simply closing the door of by a simple push button. Monitor results with the date, time background, net count, and result of check “OK” or “Alarm” shall be displayed. The user interface shall allow the users to set detection, count cycle, and alarm parameters, perform QA and calibration functions, and select output formats. The interface shall be menu driven.  The unit shall include all ancillary items needed for full and complete turnkey operations including but not limited to: power cords, surge protectors, input key boards, output printers and cables, video displays, gas regulators (if required), transport carts, shielding, and detectors cables and tubing.

Detector Characteristics

The system shall utilize detectors capable of detecting contamination from high energy beta-, gamma-, and X-ray emitting radiation sources including: Cl-36, Fe-55/59,  
Ni-63, Sr-89/90, Y-90, Tc-99/m, Mo-99, I-125/129/131, Pd-103, Cd-109, Cs-137, P-32, Am-241, Pu-239, and U-238. The detectors shall employ plastic scintillators with photomultiplier tubes.  Solid state detectors or sealed proportional tubes would be an acceptable alternative, as long as they meet the same or better performance, detection, and background suppression specifications of detectors employing plastic scintillators with photomultiplier tubes.   

The system shall be capable of detecting and alarming for activities above 2 nanocuries with a counting time not greater than 5 minutes while operating in a moderate to low external background field up to 0.2 mR/hr.

The system shall be capable of operating in the temperature range of 5&#730;C to 40ºC (41ºF to 104ºF). The system shall meet performance requirements without fluctuation or adjustment in operating parameters for normal variations in laboratory environmental conditions with room temperature 15-32 degrees Celsius, and relative humidity 20-70 percent.

The system shall operate on standard AC power at 115 to 125 volts at 60 Hz. 

The instrument shall be self contained and shall be fully incorporated onto its own wheeled cart to allow for semi-portability. The system (including computer display and output device) shall be capable of being moved by one individual, without disassembly or technical support from the manufacturer.

The internal lining and detectors shall be capable of being removed, cleaned, or replaced by NIST personnel without use of specialized tools unless such tools are provided with CLIN 0001. Detectors shall be replaceable or repairable by NIST personnel.

Count cycle times shall be variable and selectable by NIST staff ranging from 1 minute up to 15 minutes. (Alternatively count times may be adjusted automatically based on alarm set point – Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) and background algorithms). 

Monitor results shall report date, time, “Alarm”, “OK”, “Clear”, background value, and support units such as gross and net counts and/or count rates, measured activities in disintegration rates as reported in disintegrations per minute and/or SI units, and minimal detectable activities in the same units as measured activities (dps, Bq, or nanocuries). The “Alarm” and threshold shall be based on user-specified levels.

All system documentation, operation maintenance, repair manuals, and required software along with backup disks of the programs for reinstallation shall be included. A listing of all proprietary items, system requirements, current costs, and replacement lead times shall be included with the delivered documentation.


***Delivery shall be completed not later than 90 days after order acceptance.  CLIN 0001 SHALL BE OFFERED ON AN FOB DESTINATION BASIS ONLY.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT CONSIDER OFFERS ON ANY OTHER BASIS.  The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ***

CLIN 0002:  Within thirty (30) days of delivery, the Contractor shall provide a technical representative on site at NIST for setup and initial calibration of the unit. At that time, the technical representative shall provide NIST staff with training (a minimum 4 hours) on the setup, operations, QA, and maintenance of the unit. The technical representative shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the NIST COTR that the unit satisfies all aspects of the specifications in the purchase order.  If the Contractor is required to install the system, the cost of that service shall be included in CLIN 0002.***

*** The Government will not accept CLIN 0001 until after CLIN 0002 is completed and only if CLIN 0001 meets or exceeds all minimum specifications.***


EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1.     Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement

2.     Past performance information for similar contracts/orders completed within the past 3 years

<DESC>Final Questions and Answers for Solicitation # HSTS03-06-R-CAO054 TSA VAP

1.  What is the number of anticipated pickups at each airport – is there more than one TSDF?  If these are more than one TSDF, how many and what are the addresses?    Would we be required to pick-up waste other than at a TSDF, and if so, where? 

The SOW specifically calls out the minimum number of pickups per Cat per time frame.  The Offeror shall propose which TSDFs it proposes to use.  Those TSDF’s will then become subject to the audits.    

2. What is the volume of pickups (how many 55 gallon drum containers are estimated per month?) 

TSA provided the weight in the answer to a previous question posted earlier.  Please use that stated weight to establish volume.  

3. Please provide pricing for the types of containers listed on Page 11 of Section C.    

This is to be proposed by the Offeror as part of the price proposal, if invited to submit.  

4. Please provide more detailed definitions on kinds of wastes, required/preferred disposal requirements, government directed sites, etc.  

Hazmat is hazmat.  As far as disposal requirements those are set by law, which is something they should know.  

5. Will TSA consider increasing the scope to include VAC services (for sump pumps and oil/water separators)? 

No.  This nothing to do with property left at check points.  

6. Page 4, first paragraph under the line “Please note the following”

 “All contractor personnel will be required to complete and submit a confidential and non-disclosure agreement prior to beginning work.”   Further down this page it also states that “on-site personnel may be required to take annual TSA-sponsored training courses such as IT security, …etc”. 

It’s assumed that these requirements WOULD NOT apply to service personnel who pick, pack, and manifest waste and/or provide VAC Services (if it is added). Please provide additional information regarding to whom these requirements apply. 

Applies to any personnel that would need a TSA badge and access to our infrastructure.  

7. C.7 Security Requirements – please provide clarification on who will need a security clearance.  

Clearance only applicable for SIDA badging if done, everyone else must be US citizen and pass background check, applicable only if getting a TSA badge.  

8. Please provide clarification regarding whether or not the following items are considered as part of the routine waste pickups. 

Special Hazardous Materials – Ammunition, C.3.3.3.2 Special Hazardous materials – Fireworks, any radioactive materials, aerosols and compressed gas cylinders, medical waste or other kinds of ammunition: blasting caps, flares, dynamite or fireworks.  

SOW specifically states max 10 pickups per year.  

9. Please provide clarification on whether or not the specialized wastes are ALWAYS handled as one-off pickups and not assumed to be handled with the other wastes.  

Pickups of the specialized wastes are to be handled separately from the other waste. 

10. Will materials be segregated and is there a holding time for any of the materials? Will certain items be able to stay onsite until a certain quantity is reached to be picked up? 

Materials are stored onsite at airport prior to pickup.  Pickups must occur at a minimum as called out in the SOW and must also be performed when requested by an airport.  

11. Will TSA provide any manifests for the materials previously handled? Please provide any information based on previous VAP experience.  

TSA will not provide manifests for previous pickups by the current contractor.  The contractor should be aware of the manifest requirements.   

12. Please provide any previous contractor information regarding what type of “support” is required from the contractor in regards to the sharps/needles mail back program including all interested TSA locations. What are TSA’s expectations for “support”?  

As answered earlier, the contractor will be responsible for supporting the mailback program for all interested TSA locations and proposing a program to oversee and implement the program.  
 
13. Will TSA require clearance training (badging) for all drivers? We request that TSA consider excluding drivers who pickup waste and/or deliver containers. We propose considering that these persons can be brought to the sites with an escort from the airport environmental managers or their designees, rather than training them all. 

Please see the response to # 6 above.
