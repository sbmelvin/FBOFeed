<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single-source contract to DME Corporation to continue manufacturing and delivering 15 Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights (MALSR) Type # FA-17900. This will allow the FAA to maintain continuity, consistency and uninterrupted delivery of MALSR's until a replacement contract is awarded. Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to extend the current contract with a selected source. The FAA issued a request for qualifications on October 17, 2007 seeking information on potential Small Disadvantaged 8(a) or Service-disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses capable of purchasing, integrating and testing various MALSR system components in advance of their installation in the field. Because the FAA has not completed the review of those companies responding to that announcement, and there exist an immediate need for 15 MALSR systems over the next 6 to 8 months, the FAA intends to award a single source contract to the DME Corporation to fulfill this need. DME is currently the manufacture of the FA-17900 Type MALSR's being purchased by the FAA. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. If your firm believes it can fulfill the FAA requirements, current specifications and the systems are currently approved by the FAA for use in the NAS, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the equipment outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to William Keller, Contracting Officer by 12:00 A.M., Eastern Time, January 7, 2008, 800 Independence Ave, Washington DC 20591, or e-mail to William.k.keller-jr@faa.gov.

Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<CONTACT>Nicole Anderson 850-235-5386 , or Contracting Officer Mark Ross at 850-235-5624.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole source 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to BriarTek Incorporated, 112 East Delray Avenue, Alexandria, Virginia to install and validate Man Overboard Indicator (MOBI) systems on approximately 225 U.S. Navy ships.  This contract also includes personnel training and the acquisition of approximately 42,500 MOBI transmitters (p/n TX-104), 295 MOBI receivers (p/n RX-102), and 720 direction finders (p/n DF-101).  The objective of this effort is to outfit each ship with a system capable of alerting the crew of a man overboard event so that a life saving rescue can be executed.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  The USN has been evaluating Commercial Off The Shelf, Non-Developmental Item (COTS/NDI) Man Overboard Indicator (MOBI) systems since FY99.  Based upon results of multiple Field Demonstration Tests, the USN has decided to purchase an!  d install MOBI systems on all USN ships.   The MOBI system manufactured by BriarTek is the only system capable of transmitting a unique code that identifies the specific transmitter that has been activated.   This unique code eliminates confusion during instances when multiple personnel are thrown overboard simultaneously and will aid in identifying which individuals are still in the water and in need of rescue.  Because of this unique code, BriarTek Incorporated is the only company that can meet all of the US Navy requirements.  Additionally, this effort is sole source because NSWC PC has awarded three previous contracts (including contract N61331-04-F-1131, N61331-06-C-0004, and N61331-07-C-0032) to install the BriarTek-manufactured MOBI system on over 200 ships thus far.  This contract is for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development and deployment of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the ex!  act meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would re sult in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Therefore, there are no other sources that can satisfy this requirement. FSC Code: 6320 NAICS Code: 334220, Size Standard: 750.  The award will be based on an acceptable proposal on or about 15 Feb 2007.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541910 The US EPA Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA) Indoor Environments Division, under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the National Association of  Homebuilders (NAHB) in order to obtain a report on radon-resistant construction practices used by home builders in the United States during the 2006 calendar year (01 January - 31 December 2006) and will require the Contractor to extract information from existing commercial surveys of home  builders, conduct targeted focus groups, perform an analysis of the survey and focus group data, and develop a report of the results.  ORIA seeks the cost-effective risk reduction to radon exposure by promoting the use of radon-resistant construction.  Tracking of builder practices is an integral  part of promoting radon-resistant construction.  With data on the extent to which radon-resistant techniques are currently being used by builders and the types of builders that are more likely to voluntarily use radon-resistant construction, the EPA is able to assess action plans to reach the  builders and make efforts more cost-effective.  Furthermore, information garnered from qualitative analyses based on "literature searches" and focus groups IED will be able to refine its current voluntary outreach and education strategy complementing the strategy with effective messages, the most  appropriate mediums to convey the messages, and identified tools and resources to help translate these messages into risk-reducing actions.  Based on market research, the EPA believes that NAHB is the only source for this data, as the NAHB is the only association of home builders in the United  States that conducts annually a survey regarding construction practices and is the only source of annually-collected nationwide data related to builder construction practices.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this  requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the contracting officer at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION

1.1 PURPOSE

SSP is assessing the feasibility of developing a launcher test stand to support missile integration and underwater launch (test shapes potentially leading to actual submerged launch of missiles and other payloads).  SSP requires input from industry resources to refine their understanding of the technical feasibility, risk and cost implications associated with this effort.  Specifically, this RFI documents a Government request from industry for the plan/approach and rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost information associated with launcher test stand development and production in the three phase approach discussed below. 

 
1.2 BACKGROUND

The test facilities used by SSP are no longer available.  SSP has been developing underwater launch systems for over 50 years to support submarine launched missiles.  SSP needs to conduct risk identification/reduction and integration testing of new payloads prior to onboard testing and final integration on a submarine.  An adequate test stand will replicate the missile tube interface and submarine support system interfaces in order to conduct demonstration and integration testing.  Although near term demonstrations will be based on the 87 inch diameter missile tube, smaller missiles than the D5 missile are likely to be demonstrated.  Additionally, concepts for future submarines may have missile tubes larger than 87 inches in diameter.  Therefore, in order to determine potential ?knees in the curve? from a cost and capability standpoint, missile tube diameters between 87 inches and 120 inches, and 87 inches and 32 inches are considered separately.  These ranges are only provided for the purpose of identifying the determining factors associated with these two ranges and to bound configurations to be considered.  To ensure that the test stand will be usable for all scenarios into the foreseeable future, the test stand should be flexible enough to accommodate a minimum missile tube diameter of 32 inches and maximum of 120 inches.

2. DISCUSSION

2.1 CAPABILITIES

SSP is seeking information for a launcher test capability for development testing of underwater missile launch systems.  This capability consists of three separate phases.  The first phase will support land based testing of missile launch systems.  The second phase capability will support submerged static launch of missiles and other payloads within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.  The third phase capability will support submerged launch of missiles and other payloads in a relevant operational submarine environment within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.  This relevant operational submarine environment will consist of varying launch depths and dynamic water flow conditions during missile launch induced by submarine forward way and sea state (i.e. crossflow).  The first phase capability shall:

1. Support land-based testing of launcher concepts as part of missile testing.
2. Replicate SSGN Missile Tube (nominal) internal interfaces (SSGN missile tube is right-cylindrical tube approximately 87 inches in diameter and 44 feet long)

a. Be reconfigurable to support larger diameter missile tubes up to 120 inches in diameter, ?-1 inch thick and approximately 44 feet long.
b. Be reconfigurable to support smaller diameter missile tubes as small as 32 inches in diameter, ??- 1 inch thick and approximately 44 feet long)
c. Contain and replicate functions/shape of missile tube muzzle hatch.
d. Replicate the space envelope in the missile tube.

3. Be transportable while remaining non-mobile to operate in different test locations. 
4. Comply with Government environmental and safety standards.
5. Accommodate ejection of missile and other payload weights up to 200,000 pounds.

The second phase shall add the capability to:

6. Support static, submerged test launches of missiles and other payloads within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.
The third phase shall add the capability to:
7. Support submerged launch of missiles and other payloads in a relevant operational submarine environment within the twelve mile contiguous zone of U.S. territorial waters.

2.2 INTERFACE DEFINITION

Below is a listing of interface and performance considerations.  The following information is provided to support this concept development.  Government Furnished Information (GFI) will be provided by SSP as requested. 

1. Mechanical Interfaces (e.g. Physical interfaces, Pressurization & Venting system, Hydraulic system, Heating & Cooling system, Dehumidification & Drying system)
2. Electrical Interfaces (e.g. Umbilical for Data/Power)
3. Data Recording & Interface Data Connectivity
4. Environmental (test/handling shock, payload release shock (recoil), vibration, sea water immersion, sea water pressure, launch debris)
5. Wharfside operations & Initial Missile Onload (e.g. Cranes, Maintenance Platforms, Hoists)
6. Dry Stowage (e.g. mothballed)
7. Missile Launch (e.g. Eject velocity, Missile loads, Cavitation loads)
8. Wet Stowage
9. Missile off-load

2.3 INFORMATION REQUESTED

Provide conceptual technical information, comments and ROM cost assessments (where applicable) for the following items:

1. Test Stand Concept - Provide a Level 1(Overall System) physical architecture, approach and cost ROM for a test stand that meets the aforementioned capabilities (section 2.1-1 thru 5) and subsequent modifications to meet phase II capabilities (6) and phase III additional capabilities (7). Also provide architecture and ROM cost to allow the replacement of the nominal 87 inch diameter missile tube with up to 120 inch diameter missile tube or down to 32 inch diameter missile tube.  Discuss any issues related to providing this flexibility.
2. Design Impacts-

a. Comment on design considerations to modify the concept(s) from phases I and II to provide the desired phase III capability?
b. Comment on how the incorporation of the desired phase III capability would impact the phase I and phase II design concept(s).
3. Concept of Operations (CONOPS) ? Provide a CONOPS which clearly defines the associated test and tactical demonstration scenarios to be employed for each phase.  Include the anticipated test stand motion induced from payload release. Also, comment on how launch preparation, maintenance and downtime will be minimized, and how the design will minimize acquisition and operating costs. 
4. Test Facility Integration - Identify and describe any facility support/foundation requirements and or equipment for each phase.  Comment on any desired sea bed modifications (i.e. surface hardness) to support the test platform.
5. Multiple Locations - The test stand may be redeployed to other locations to meet test requirements.  These test locations could be land based CONUS, such as Crane, Indiana or Aberdeen, MD, at one of the National Test Sites such as PMRF, Hawaii, or in the ocean near one of these sites.  Comment on how the non-mobile launcher test stand will be broken down, transported, and stored at different test locations.  Provide any known physical or environmental limitations/constraints that will prohibit the use of the test stand at multiple locations.
6. Maintainability - In the past, the submerged launcher capability slowly eroded due to the high cost of maintaining the facility or set of facilities.  Provide comments on how this platform will accommodate both periods of testing and periods of storage, and will still be usable within a short time frame.    
7. Crossflow ? Describe methods to reach desired dynamic water flow conditions induced by submarine forward way and sea state conditions (i.e. crossflow up to 10 knots) at the muzzle face of the test platform.  The intent is to adequately replicate operational launch conditions.  Describe ROM costs and design considerations for different methods. 
8. Future modifications - Provide recommended future modifications (if any) that would make the test stand more robust for integration testing.
9. Risk - Discuss the risks associated with executing the proposed development plan to deliver the desired hardware to the government.  Also, identify any risks of using the test stand as proposed.
10. Cost - Discuss cost drivers associated with executing the design, fabrication and use of the test platform when going from phase I to phase II and phase II to phase III.
11. Schedule - Discuss project schedule to accomplish each phase.  Discuss constraints that would adversely impact fast tracking the project (i.e. initial operational capability within 18 months of contract go-ahead for phase I & II).

<DESC>The presolicitation notice for temperature monitors is hereby revised to include the following sole source justification:

The Defense Distribution Depot Susquehanna (DDSP) is currently responsible for a large number of the Department of Defense?s (DoD) temperature sensitive material shipments to forces worldwide; to include, but not limited to, vaccines and readiness medications.  Per the Federal Drug Administration, these items require a constant temperature range of 2-8 degrees Celsius while in transit in order to guarantee potency.

The Defense Supple Center Philadelphia (DSCP), in coordination with the United States Medical Material Agency (USAMMA), has developed engineered and third party validated Cold Chain Packaging Protocols to ensure FDA compliance on these types of items.  

An essential component of these packaging protocols is the temperature monitoring device.  When validated, the TempTale4 (TT4) temperature monitor manufactured by Sensitech Inc. was utilized.  This monitor?s specific dimensions are critical to the cargo space requirement mandated by these packaging protocols.  Hardware and software packages specifically supporting the TempTale4 are in place at DSCP for the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Cold Chain Management program ? these monitors are utilized to provide disposition on cold chain shipments to DoD customers worldwide.  Additionally, over 100 TT4 hardware and software packages have been deployed worldwide with DoD units to support the expedient transfer of data to DSCP critical for disposition.  DoD personnel have been specifically trained on Sensitech?s product, to include the operation of?return of?and analysis of the TT4.

Use of the TT4 has been identified as part of DLAI 4145-21 for the required packaging of temperature sensitive materials.  This DLA Instruction is a Joint instruction that in addition to DDSP is utilized by all Air Force, Army, Navy, and Coast Guard cold chain packaging locations (and their contractors)?all of which are required to use the TT4 as identified by regulation.

Although there are other similar products in the industry today, the DLA Cold Chain Management program has been built around Sensitech?s TT4.  Any change in monitoring devices would require a modification to DLAI 4145-21, which would then in-turn require all of DoD to alter their procedures and DSCP would be required to retrain all DoD personnel (to include DDC?s Defense Depot?s).  Most importantly, however, it would require DSCP to pull back all hardware and software packages currently deployed, purchase new requirements, and retrain all sites in order for downrange customers to be able to utilize temperature data?this would create an immediate negative impact on mission due to the time requirement to make all of these things happen, not to mention the financial impact.

The intent of the presolicitation remains unchanged,  the notice is still for information purposes only.

<DESC>SAIC-Frederick, the Operations and Maintenance Contractor for the NCI Frederick Cancer Research Facility is soliciting for the services described herein on behalf of the NCI. The NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer (CPTC) initiative was established with the goal of creating technologies, data, reagents and reference materials, analysis systems and infrastructure as a basis for advancing discovery research and clinical applications.  More information about the initiative can be found at http://proteomics.cancer.gov.  As part of the CPTC, a series of renewable and highly characterized affinity binding reagents will be generated and made available to the research community.  Detailed standard operating procedures (SOP?s) will be made available along with characterization data through a web portal.  This will ensure that experiments can be both repeated and compared among researchers.
 

The specific objective of this scope of work is to generate antibodies from antigens already generated under the CPTC. There are forty-two antigens that will be used in the generation and screening for new monoclonal antibodies. 
 

Once a set of antibodies are generated and screened by the contractor for each antigen, the antibodies will be sent to SAIC-F and undergo further screening and characterization including but not limited to Western Blot, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), immuno capture and mass spectrometry, and immuno histochemistry (IHC).  The data from all phases of the characterization, i.e. from contractor and other entities selected by NCI will be made public through the associated web portal.  The final antibodies and associated hybridoma cells will be made available to the scientific community through a distributor or repository selected by the NCI.  


The RFP is intended to solicit responses from parties interested in providing the antibodies to the NCI CPTC.  Multiple contracts may be issued. Full RFP to be posted by end of day 11/19/07.

<DESC>120mm Illum Solicitation W15QKN-07-R-0320 Clarifications 1.	Is the EPA clause mandatory or voluntary? Government Response:  As we are in a competitive environment and all offerors  must be evaluated the same, the EPA clause is mandatory for all offerors. 2.	The EPA clause states that there shall be no adjustment of price for  any change that would not result in a net change of at least five per cent of  the price initially awarded.  Is this a five per cent change in the cost of  steel, or the unit price of the mortar? Government Response:  The five per cent change is based on the unit price of  the shell body.   3.	Clause 52.232-16, Progress Payments, is not incorporated by reference  in section I.  Is this an error and will Progress Payments be authorized? Government Response:  Progress Payments may be authorized to the awardee only  if he has an approved accounting system.

Included among those examinations are three that require examiners to observe examinees performing specific job-related activities and record observed behaviors:  the Initial Road Test (Examination 804), the End-of-training Road Test (Examination 806), and the Automotive Bench Test (Examination 941).  The USPS is interested in automating the recording of examination behaviors, in order to further expedite data capture and scoring.

Postal Service Information

The U.S. Postal Service currently has three work-sample examinations that are administered in a one-on-one environment, where the examiner observes the examinee and records observed, exam-related behaviors.  Currently, the behaviors are recorded on a scannable form, then the form is scanned and a score is generated.  We are interested in seeking solutions to automate this process.

Two of the examinations are driving exams, where the examiner is riding in the passenger side of a moving vehicle while recording observed behaviors.  The third examination is an automotive maintenance exam, where the examiner is observing the examinee in a workroom environment.  Because of the mobile nature of the examination administrations, it is important that the automated solution also be mobile, such as a laptop, electronic notepad, digital pen or handheld display device.  Further, the driving exam form includes over 100 behaviors and the behaviors are not performed sequentially.  Therefore, the form or interface needs to allow for examiners to easily view and read test items, quickly navigate among and locate the appropriate items, and record them while sitting in a moving vehicle.

An examinee?s score is calculated by combining the values of the behaviors observed (or not observed), following a pre-determined scoring algorithm.  Examinees pass or fail as a result of their exam score, based on a pre-set passing score. 

We are seeking an automated solution to use for administering these examinations.  We are interested in learning about automated solutions that offer one or more of the following benefits:
1.	A portable device that can be held, carried, viewed and accessed in a moving vehicle and in a work room.
2.	A user-friendly interface for examiners to view behavioral statements and mark when observed or not observed.
3.	Automated exam scoring.
4.	Data transfer to a central database.

<DESC>1. Introduction. The Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA) is seeking information for a best-in-breed, Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product to offer its golf operations throughout the world an improved level of standardized business practices and centralized reporting.  Standardized business practices will help us leverage the commercial sector?s best practices which translates into more efficient operations and potential cost savings.  In addition, standardized business practices will also allow for improved centralized reporting to the Agency?s Shared Service Center.  

2. Project Scope.  AFSVA desires a proven Golf Course management solution which will be deployed world-wide.  This solution will be scaleable to support the level of local operations (the Air Force has golf courses of various sizes and usage), compatible with current systems and reporting schemes, reasonably maintained and upgraded, and with a training program that current employees will find intuitive. As the systems integrator, AFSVA seeks an enterprise-wide, preferably web-based solution.  We desire this solution to facilitate  all typical transactions of a private or municipal golf course to include, but not limited to:

   -Tee times, handicaps, pro shop sales, tournament management, rental equipment, food & beverage sales 
   -Inventory management
   -Customer Relations Management
   -Point of Sale management
   -Operations reporting (i.e. rounds of golf played and other related metrics)
   -Marketing to include customer relations and promotions
   -Financial reporting and data
   -Contingency plan for web-access failure 
   -Data exchange to the Air Force Services Financial Management System (Oracle) and have the ability to populate an enterprise Balance Score Card (Oracle) using the DT Studio data broker
   -Provide the security of Personally Identifiable Information (Privacy Act)
   -Credit card and private label card transaction information in accordance with Purchase Card Industry (PCI) standards, and encryption of such data when stored within the system boundaries or related databases.
   -Minimum hardware and software requirements, with pricing estimates
   -Current customers, commercial and government, with similar scope of operations

3. Operations.  The AFSVA owns and operates 78 Golf Courses at 66 Air Force Bases world-wide varying from 9 to 54 holes at each facility.  Each Golf Course manages a Pro-Shop, cart fleet, driving range and equipment rental as well as a Food and Beverage operation.  Sixty-three of the Golf Courses are within the Continental United States (CONUS) while 13 of the courses are outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).  Twelve out of 66 bases manage more than 18 holes.
  
4. Respondents.  As part of your response, please indicate if a demonstration of your system can be given at HQ AFSVA, 10100 Reunion Place, Ste 304, San Antonio Texas 78216.
  
5. Replies to RFI. To maintain consistency and equality in this process, vendors are requested to use the structure outlined below for their response.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a market search for large and small businesses in preparation for a future procurement. The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling support. In particular, EPA is seeking sources that can provide technical support for the Agency?s evaluation, modification, and application of PBPK models to derive health-based reference values.   Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models provide a chemical- specific quantitative characterization of a chemical?s toxicokinetics, and if adequately developed and tested, have the potential to replace uncertainty factors when estimating internal dose in different species (i.e., test animals and humans) resulting from a variety of exposure regimens. As such, PBPK models are increasingly being used in the derivation of reference values either to replace the non-chemical-specific uncertainty factors (e.g., to account for uncertainties in interspecies extrapolation and intraspecies variability) or to bridge data gaps where no uncertainty factors exist (e.g., route-to-route extrapolation; exposure duration extrapolation).   Specific areas to be addressed in capability packages submitted by respondents are as follows: (1) Developing and/or evaluating technical concepts, methods, or information technologies (e.g., databases, model archives, web-based search and retrieval) that would enhance the use of PBPK models in health assessments; (2) Performing initial evaluations of available pharmacokinetic (PK) and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models that may have potential use in an assessment for a specified chemical;  (3) Performing detailed evaluation of models, recommendations for further model development or modifications that are needed to meet a specific use;  (4) Further developing or modifying models indicated for specific uses in an assessment; (5) Applying quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) methodology to estimate model parameters; and (6) Developing information resources that support model development, or maintain and further elaborate existing resources. The successful contractor of any resultant contract will be expected to provide all necessary labor, materials, and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A draft PWS can be obtained for the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  Any interested firms should submit capability statement with information that clearly demonstrates their capabilities to provide the services described above, including facilities, personnel, experience and qualifications. A description of previously developed PBPK models, PBPK model enhancements, or use of QSAR in model development shall be provided. Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) with five one-year periods, each with LOE of approximately 5,700 hours.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $6.5M. In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women-owned, small-disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. Responses to the above should be submitted to schweibold.cindy@epa.gov no later than 25 calendar days from the date of posting. A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP), resulting from this sources sought synopsis.

<CONTACT>JODY M. GOSNELL, Contract Specialist, Phone: 202-564-4353, E-Mail: gosnell.jody@epa.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this is to amend the Sources Sought originally posted under the Region 1 Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) at http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/errsregion1/index.htm Reference-Number-ERRSIII-Region I. All information related to the Region 1 Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) at http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/errsregion1/index.htm Reference-Number-ERRSIII-Region I is now posted under the  Superfund/RCRA Regional Procurement Operations Division (SRRPOD) at  http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/  under Region 1 Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS).  The new reference number is PR-HQ-07-12299.  Information relating to the Region 1 Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) will no longer be posted at http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/errsregion1/index.htm. Amendment 1 - Sources Sought   EPA is requesting additional information to evaluate the experience/capability of vendors interested in responding to the Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) III requirement for EPA Region I.  If you previously submitted a qualification package and would like to expand on your company's responses regarding the following questions, please forward your response to Jody Gosnell, Placement Contracting Officer at gosnell.jody@epa.gov.  If you have not submitted a qualification package and would like to, please refer to the Sources Sought Notice posted on March 22, 2007 on EPA's webpage at URL http://www.epa.gov/oam/regions/index.htm#sources under Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) for Region 1 and please to the page limit in the Sources Sought Notice.  All new qualification package submittals should address the questions below.  If you have already submitted a qualification package and are addressing the questions below please limit your response to no more than 1 page (single sided 12 point text). All qualification packages (new or revised) are due to Jody Gosnell via email at gosnell.jody@epa.gov by 3:30pm on Thursday, June 27, 2007.   1) Is your company interested in the entire requirement? A number of the companies who responded indicated interest in the entire requirement although it appeared that some of the qualification packages (Statement of Qualification/SOQ) did not adequately address all the capability elements specified in the requirement.  In some instances vendors anticipate ramping up within the Region if they are awarded a contract, however, for the purposes of our Market Research, the Region does not want to incorrectly assume a vendor is prepared to perform the full requirement.  We are requesting that any vendor who is interested in performing only a portion of the requirement indicate that fact and state the portion(s) of the requirement that they are willing to do.  Before responding please read the rest of this message.   2)  Level A Team requirements, and 3)  Emergency Response Times   The two elements above have been revised in the Draft PWS.  All interested vendors should submit the information as follows on both: Level A Team:  The number of personnel required has been reduced to 7 which include two (2) three-person entry teams and a Response Manager.  Many of the vendors responded indicating they had Level A capabilities but did not indicate their ability to mobilize a Level A team. Initial emergency response time frames: The 24/7 emergency response mobilization times have been relaxed for certain portions of the Region.  To ensure consistency in evaluation of vendor capability assumptions are provided regarding distances traveled per hour which we believe can be reasonably achieved.  For the purposes of evaluating responses the Region shall assume a vendor would be capable of traveling 40 miles per hour once notified of the need to respond. The 2-hour response times within the region are represented as the area within an 80-mile distance (radius) from the center of the primary geographic locations (major cities) identified below: MA (Boston, Worcester, Springfield, New Bedford, Fall River) RI (Providence, Pawtucket)  CT (Hartford, New London) NH (Concord, Manchester, Nashua) The 4-hour response times within the region are defined as the area between 80 miles and 160 miles from the center of the primary geographic locations listed above. VT (Montpelier, Burlington); ME (Portland, Augusta) The 6-hour response time shall include the area between 160 and 240 miles from the geographic locations listed above.  That incorporates central ME, VT and NH.  Areas beyond 240 miles including the northern borders of the State of NY, and the south and southwest boarder of Canada and the United States shall be considered an 8-hour response time.

<DESC>Reference previous Sources Sought Notice FA8203-07-R-ATLAS and 'referencenumberFA820308RATLAS' for draft documents.

Hill AFB intends to solicit and award a contract to conduct studies and analyses, develop prototype components, and accomplish testing and certification efforts as required to maintain or improve flight safety and to improve the reliability and maintainability (R & M) of landing gear systems. The acquisition integrates elements of emerging materials/technologies, improved designs, state-of-the-art repair/overhaul techniques, and optimized business/data processes. 

The Applied Technologies for Landing Systems (ATLAS) Program was established in 2005 to address MAJCOM concerns and meet their objectives of (1) ensuring mission safety (2) improving operation capability/performance, improving Reliability and Maintainability, and (3) reducing the cost of sustainment.

The program is focused on implementing safety, reliability/maintainability, and sustainment improvements for all Government-managed landing gear systems and related infrastructure (depot and field). This program provides integrated services, designs, prototypes, repairs, and processes.

The ATLAS Program integrates the following major elements to accomplish safety and mission-capable objectives:

-       Component redesign to support increased weight/performance requirements.
-       Commercial technology insertion.
-       Development of improved materials, coatings, and processes to minimize corrosion and wear (with emphasis on reducing environmental impact)
-       Improved maintenance/repair/overhaul (MRO) strategies
-       Improved logistics/business/data strategies.

The goal is to significantly reduce complexity, improve reliability and maintainability, reduce cost of landing gear components with the overall objective of extending the life of landing gear systems/components.

The Government anticipates awarding a 5 year ID/IQ contract for this effort, with fully loaded labor rate and cost CLINS.

In order to avoid organizational and consultant conflicts of interest the contractor shall comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.505.

At the commencement of performance the contractor shall have the capabilities to meet the following criteria:  Functional Lead Engineers.  The contractor shall utilize functional leads to plan and supervise all projects/tasks within the functional areas as defined above.  Each functional lead shall be seasoned engineers with experience working in the functional specific areas listed below:  Project Lead Engineers.  The contractor shall also utilize seasoned system engineers to act as project leads.  Each project lead shall have past project lead experience on landing gear systems.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST - FABRICATE STORAGE MODULES FOR RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL AT THE MATERIALS AND FUEL COMPLEX (MFC) LOCATED AT THE IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY

I.	INTRODUCTION
Battelle Energy Alliance LLC (BEA), Management & Operating Contractor of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), is requesting an expression of interest from prospective fabricators to produce and deliver between 300 and 400 steel modules to be used for the storage of radioactive material. The first 150 to 200 modules must be fabricated by September 15, 2008, with the balance to be fabricated and delivered by August 30, 2009.  Delivery will be to the Materials and Fuel Complex (MFC) at INL, located approximately 40 miles from Idaho Falls, ID. The modules must meet NQA-1 requirements. NAICS Codes: 332313 (Plate Work Manufacturing), 332710 (Machine Shops), and 332996 (Fabricated Pipe and Pipe Fitting Manufacturing).

This expression of interest will serve as a method of identifying interested candidates that possess the qualifications to fabricate the modules. The qualified responders will receive a formal Request for Proposal for the scope of work summarized herein.

II.	BACKGROUND
The INL is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory with headquarters in Idaho Falls, Idaho. The modules are part of an upgrade to a system that stores radioactive material. The work scope includes preparation of shop drawings, fabrication of the storage modules, and delivery of the storage modules.

III.	MODULES
The modules will be fabricated in two pieces: an outer shell made of carbon steel and an inner Storage Tube Weldment made of stainless steel.

The outer shell of each module consists of a 16-inch-diameter carbon steel schedule 10 pipe that is approximately 23 inches long with end plates welded on each end. A 10-inch square carbon steel structural tubing that is 3 inches long is welded to each end plate, extending the outer shell to approximately 29 inches long. The carbon steel must be painted with epoxy paint.

The inner tube of each module consists of an 8-inch-diameter schedule 40 pipe that is approximately 29 inches long. One end of the pipe has an end plate welded to it and the other end has a hinged, round door with latching mechanism and indexing plunger. The entire inner tube assembly is made of stainless steel.

The inner tube slides into the outer shell and is held in place with 4 bolts. The structural tube on each end of the outer shell holds the modules on racks to be fabricated under a separate procurement.

Tolerances are still in the process of being established, but they generally range from 0.1 to 0.01 inches.

IV.	SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
Prospective candidates should provide a brief written response to address the following:

1. Overview of the candidate company, perhaps in the form of an  annual report or web page link

2. Quality control and quality assurance, including ASME NQA-1-2000, Quality Assurance Requirements for Nuclear Facility Applications, capability and your program for assessment/surveillance

3. Production capacity to meet the production requirements described in the first paragraph of the introduction, including personnel, equipment, and potential teaming with other companies

4. Name, phone number, and e-mail address of a representative of your firm who we can contact regarding this Request for Expression of Interest.

Within the next two months, BEA plans to issue a Request for Proposal that will allow award of a subcontract to fabricate the modules. In order to help us develop the Request for Proposal, please provide any or all of the following optional information:

1. Rough order of magnitude budget estimate to fabricate and deliver each module

2. Comments on the tolerances and their impact on cost and schedule

3. Preferred contract type, for example, unit price or cost reimbursable, and reason for the preference

4. Impact of a variation in quantity of modules actually ordered of as much as 50%; that is, in general terms, how your operation would be impacted if we changed the number of modules ordered to either 150 modules or 600 modules total.
Lack of response to the last 4 items will not affect the evaluation of the candidate?s expression of interest.

Please provide your expression of interest to the undersigned by Close-of Business, January 15, 2007. If you have questions or need additional information, please contact Dan Stout at (208) 533-7374 or email daniel.stout@inl.gov. Technical questions must be submitted in writing (U.S. Mail or email).

The successful firm will be required to provide expa nsions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The  Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding al l capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  The electric system being privatized is described as follows:  Charlotte/Douglas International Airport (IAP) is located six miles west of Charlotte, NC and is home to the 145th Airlift Wing.  The base is located on the east side of the airport on a 79 acre parcel of highly developed land.  There are a total of 41 buildings; 2 administrative, 3 services, and 36 industrial, amounting to approximately 330,000 square fee t.  The base has no residential or transient housing facilities.  Day-to-day activities are managed by 312 full-time personnel.  This increases to 1350 personnel during the unit training drills conducted one weekend each month.  The base also has two geogr aphically separated units (GSU); Badin Air Guard Station (AGS), and Stanly County Airport Regional Training Center that are located approximately 60 miles northeast of Charlotte ANGB.  The GSUs are not part of this solicitation.  Projected future mission r equirements and a steady increase in the base population have necessitated the construction of new facilities and the renovation or demolition of older facilities.  Electrical power utility service enters the base and is metered at one location.  Voltage i s delivered and distributed at 12.47 (kV) through a radial feed, with wye connections on the secondary circuits.  The primary distribution system consists of three-phase circuits rated at 15 kV all buried underground in ductbanks and/or conduit at an avera ge depth of 2 to 3 feet.  The ductbanks are tinted red and marked with warning tape.  Multiple branches feed to 16 three phase pad mounted transformers that range from 45 kVA to 1000 kVA and one 15 kVA single phase transformer.  The system includes three 3 -way and three 4-way sectionalizing terminal boxes, 8 manholes, and a 15kV three-phase recloser with control panel.  The system splits into a north branch and a south branch with no backup from alternative power sources.  Mission-critical facilities, such as those located on the flight line, have portable diesel generators for backup power (not included in the solicitation).  In addition, power for the engine test cell pad, fire rescue station, and group training area are supplied directly by Duke Power Com pany owned distribution lines and meters.  The under ground circuits were installed in 1992 and are considered in excellent condition.  Base personnel indicate the current capacity is adequate and sufficient to meet the planned expansion of base facilities .  Interested sources shall contact MSGT CHRIS AMBURN, Christopher.amburn@ncchar.ang.af.mil 704-391-4209.

There has been a modification in item 12 in the scope of work to add new activities related to the closing of the construction and commissioning of the new office building project and the return of the old office building to its owner, the total estimated cost of the original contract will be increased by $43,398.The primary purpose of the original contract is to provide engineering and construction oversight of the USAID/Guatemala OIB Project and provide monthly reports to the USAID Executive Officer. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that the developer followed established criteria provided by Department of State Diplomatic Security, the Office of Overseas Building Operations and USAID's Office of Security in the design and construction of a new office building for USAID/Guatemala. This second extension period was brought by unexpected delays in the construction and commissioning of the IOB. Therefore is necessary to extend the period of performance of Mr. Carmeron's contract to allow him to fully perform the original objectives. Issuing a new instrument for such a short period of time is not practical because of the additional costs and time required to get a new mechanism established and fully functioning for such period of time, and also because current implementation momentum would be disrupted. The Mission does not anticipate contracting this type of services in the future as this is a specific project that will fully completed early calendar year 2008.This modification to contract No. 520-C-00-06-00079-00 is being proposed under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or unacceptable delays. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement within 15 days of publication of this notice. In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(xv), all responsible sources may submit to the Point of Contact a bid, proposal or quotation which shall considered by the agency.However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the Government. This is a sole source requirement and we will proceed with the award on that basis.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Protective Equipment for the Mitigation of   Blast-Induced Traumatic Brain Injury
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY

Protective Equipment for the Mitigation of 
Blast-Induced Traumatic Brain Injury

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity for research and development with an industrial partner, the goal of which is to design the next generation of protective equipment for warfighters against blast. The research will use LLNL?s expertise and high fidelity modeling methods which have generated new understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to blast-induced brain trauma.

Background: The cost of treating traumatic brain injury (TBI) in soldiers is estimated to run into billions of dollars in the future. To date, the majority of research targeted at understanding and mitigating TBI has focused on impact (blunt trauma), where the duration and magnitude of the acceleration imparted by the impact are typically used to predict damage. However, in war zones or in areas of urban conflict, blasts can be a significant contributor to TBI. The effects of blunt and blast-induced trauma differ, but the underlying damage producing mechanisms in blasts have not yet been identified clearly. Mechanical loads other than accelerations may account for some or all of the blast damage. Using LLNL modeling methods that can couple blast loads directly to biological models, LLNL has discovered a new mechanism that may contribute significantly to the generation of blast-induced traumatic brain injury. Current protection systems, e.g., helmets, are designed primarily to protect against various forms of shrapnel, not blast. Leveraging LLNL modeling methods and understanding of this new mechanism could contribute to the design of protective equipment that better protects against blast without sacrificing its effectiveness against other threats. 

Description:  	LLNL?s high fidelity hydrocode is capable of predicting blast loads and directly coupling those loads to structures to predict a mechanical response. By combining this code and our expertise in modeling blast-structure interaction and damage, along with our access to experimental data and testing facilities, we can contribute to the design of protective equipment that can better mitigate the biological effects of blast.

Advantages:  

New understanding of how blast can contribute to brain trauma provides a pathway for improving helmet systems and other protective equipment, and designing vehicles or structures to enhance the protection of their occupants from blast. Better designs for protective equipment and vehicles would result in fewer casualties from TBI, improved operational effectiveness, and reduced costs associated with veterans? treatment. There is also the potential to provide criteria, or even sensing devices, for identifying when blast victims might require immediate medical intervention, independent of what they self-report, and therefore save lives.
Potential Applications: 
The principal goal is to develop personal or vehicular armor systems that provide better protection from blast effects, so the primary commercial users will be the military and civilian protective forces. However, there are also potential applications in any industry where workers have potential exposure to blasts or other large pressure shocks (e.g. mining companies, construction firms, etc.).  

Development Status:  

Current computational results are preliminary. Additional computational analyses of blast phenomena and possible designs are necessary, as well as experimental or field validation. 

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Contract
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Tactical Technology Office (TTO), intends to award a Sole Source contract to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Sunnyvale, CA for continuation of the Aero-Adaptive/Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) Program under a 15-month Phase 1A contract. Previous Phase 0 ABC activities were completed by Lockheed Martin under Contract No. FA9550-04-C-0142. Under the Phase 0 contract, Lockheed Martin  investigated the utility of a high energy laser, integrated into a high-speed tactical aircraft for self-defense, and explored experimental techniques to characterize and influence aero-optic beam quality. The proposed Phase IA effort is a logical follow-on to the effort conducted by Lockheed Martin under Contract No. FA9550-04-C-0142 to demonstrate a turbulence control method in order to improve power flux on target in high speed flight, particularly in the lateral and aft field of regard. Specifically, Lockheed Martin will conduct a turret trade study as well as evaluate and select a preferred flow control approaches in a subscale wind tunnel test. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  As the developer of the ABC concept, Lockheed Martin possesses unique knowledge, capabilities and proprietary intellectual property/data required to carry out the required research effort.

<SUBJECT>A -- solar thermal electricity generation
<DESC>The generation of electricity from the sun is gathering increased traction as the U.S looks to increase its energy security, reduce dependence on foreign sources of oil, and minimize the environmental footprint of energy generation technologies.  Concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) is one technology that can generate electricity at a large scale from the sun.  CSP processes generate electrity by focusing solar radiation onto a heat receptor, which converts the solar energy into electrons.  Parabolic trough systems that reflect the sun?s energy onto a heat collection element (HCE) are the most widespread method of CSP electricity generation.  The heat absorption and retention of the HCE is a key driver in the overall efficiency of the parabolic trough system. Innovations in the selective coating applied to the HCE can significantly improve the heat absorption and heat retention.  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed a solar selective coating that, in preliminary tests, has exhibited absorption characteristics comparable to current HCE technology while re-emitting less energy. The NREL coating can withstand higher operating temperatures than conventional coatings, making it a potentially more robust solution in CSP design. Ultimately, we believe that utilization of the NREL HCE coating in CSP manufacture will lead to more efficient and less expensive solar thermal electricity generation. NREL is looking for a commercial partner to assist in the development of our HCE product.  The goal of this joint development effort would be to establish a commercial product.  The ideal commercial partner will have a presence in the CSP industry and the resources (technical, financial, sales, marketing) and experience (management) to develop and commercialize this early stage technology.  To respond to this announcement, please submit a 3-5 page letter of interest to the person and address listed below.  The letter should contain company information, contact information as well as descriptions of CSP experience and early stage technology development experience.  Additionally, please list any previous work that the company has completed for a national laboratory.

Answer:
It is incumbent upon the contractor to propose its technical approach to the PWS to ensure it meets the stated requirements.  Paragraph 5.1.5.1.7 describes the number of MTTs.  
Question 13:
Does the 80 page limitation include the cost proposal or resumes?
Answer:
The 80 page limitation pertains to the entire proposal submission.
Question 14:
Paragraph 1.7, Place of Performance, states that ?the place of performance may extend outside the U.S. 50 states as dictated by mission requirements and as directed by Congress?.  Please identify specific foreign locations where performance may be required.  The specific location may have international tax and OCONUS differential cost implications.  Please also advise if the employees will be deployable to war zone locations. 
Answer:
There are NO pre-determined foreign locations for the deployment of Deployable Specialized Forces (DSF) at this time.  However, the DSF serves in areas including but not limited to Bahrain, Puerto Rico, Panama, Canada, and the Republic of Philippines.
Question 15: 
Please provide differences between the two types of groups located in Amendment 2?
2.19   DOG (Deployable Operations Group)? A Coast Guard major command that serves as the Type Commander for the MSST, MSRT, and TACLET programs. While not specifically designated as an operational entity, the DOG possesses an organic deployable staff element that can provide a robust Command, Control and Communication capability in case of contingency operations. 
2.22	DSF (Deployable Specialized Forces) consists of MSST, TACLET, MSRT, PSU and NSF units: Maritime Safety and Security Teams (MSSTs); Tactical Law Enforcement Teams (TACLET); Maritime Security Response Team (MSRT); Port Security Units (PSUs) and National Strike Force (NSF)
Answer:
The DOG is a major command supporting the DSF units.  They are generally not deployable to any maritime and national security events, though they may provide supporting detachment.  The DOG?s functions parallel those of the Naval Special Warfare Command.  The DSF are subordinate units to the DOG.  These units are all deployable.
Question 16:  They provide a CLIN00001 Transition-in Support Services but nothing being states as guidelines for this event, can the government provide guidelines for this?
No real description for ?Transition Plan Requirements? located in Amendment 2. 
Answer:
The Transition Plan is a two-week (80-hour) period for the new contractor to be on sight and learn from the incumbent, to minimize the impact of the transition.  Likewise, at the conclusion of this effort, the contractor wil be required to work with the follow on contractor (should there be a follow on effort) to ease the transition at that time.  The objective is for the contractor(s) to familiarize themselves with the day-to-day operations, i.e., equipment, training materials, etc. (transition-in) and (Transition-out) to minimize impact of transition.
Question 17:  
Is it the Government?s intent to make this a limited bid by releasing the RFP as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside, located in the Description? 
Answer:
This is a full and open competition.
Question 18:
The following FAR clauses cited in 52.212-5(b) are applicable to this contract: 1; 5; and 14 through 23. 
Answer:
This clause was inadvertently included; this procurement will NOT be a small business set-aside.   As of the posting of these questions, the subject clause is hereby removed from the solicitation.
Question 19:  
There are thirteen Key Personnel positions described in PWS Para 1.4.  Where will these key personnel be assigned (i.e. SMTC training courses, MTT or MSRT Chesapeake)?   
Answer:
Some key personnel such as instructors will be assigned to SMTC Camp Lejeune, NC and MSRT Chesapeake, VA.  Key personnel will not be assigned to MTT.  Other key personnel will be assigned at Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington, DC.  
Question 20:
Paragraph 5.1.4 sub paragraphs define all FFP courses.  Solicitation requires offeror to provide pricing IAW associated CLINs for FFP.  Sub paragraphs and/or associated CLINs do not define number of students that will attend and course breakdown for lab/class assigned hours (Course Master Schedule). 
Answer:
Refer to Paragraph 5.1.6.1; 5.1.6.2; 5.1.6.3; 5.1.6.4; 5.1.6.4; and 5.1.6.6 for maximum class sizes. 
Question 21:
Will the government provide Course Master Schedule and related Course Administrative Front Matter that supplies competitors with the necessary details to submit a FFP quote that is inclusive of the requirements?   
Answer:
There is no definitive course schedule available as that is dependant upon student availability and mission needs.
Question 21:
Paragraph 1.3.2.15 of amendment 5 calls out specific ?must? qualifications to include: Graduate of Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps Advanced Military Studies Program and the Strategic Development Expert hold a 3-L designator; does the Coast Guard (DHS) intend to limit competition by requiring the Strategic Development Expert to have:
?X	Had graduated from a DOD service military studies program (SAMS)? 
?X	Served on the Joint Staff in the J5 or J8 shop? 
?X	Hold a 3 L designator? 
Answer:
It is incumbent upon the offeror to propose those persons or person who can provide the appropriate level of expertise to successfully perform all requirements in support of the Strategic Development Expert requirements as stated in the PWS.
Question 22:
Will the government consider the long standing Joint Qualifications Officer (JQO) qualifications for 3-L, equivalent To designate as JQOs ? are officers who have completed Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) Phase II (or in the case of RC officers, Advanced Joint Professional Military Education (AJPME)) and a full S-JDA or who have met such additional criteria as prescribed by the Secretary of Defense in Enclosure 3 of DoDI 1300.19, October 31, 2007.
Answer:
The JQO designator will satisfy the requirement for the 3L designator.
Question 23:
Would it be possible to obtain an extension on questions until noon December 18, 2007? 
Answer:
No extensions will be granted for the submission of questions.
Question 24:
In the instructions for evaluation factor 2 (Relevant Past Performance), the RFP states that contractors should ?Include three references??  However, the next paragraph indicates that ?Offerors are required to submit at least 3 Relevant Past Performance references.?
We assume that we should provide three reference contracts, no more and no less. Is this a correct assumption?
Answer:
You are to submit at least three references.  You are permitted to submit more if you would like, however, only three are required, if available.  If none available, as per the FAR, a neutral rating for relevant past performance shall be noted for that evaluation factor.

Question 25:
Evaluation factor 1 states that ?Resumes of contractor personnel proposed for this procurement shall be evaluated as part of this evaluation factor.? What else will be evaluated for evaluation factor 1?

Answer:
In determining the offeror?s Relevant Experience/Proposed Personnel, the Government will be evaluating the collective relevant experience of the offeror as well as the proposed personnel for the key personnel positions.

Question 26:
Should offerors include a signed statement of commitment from proposed personnel to appear at the end of each resume?

Answer:
Yes.

Question 27:
The RFP indicates that the page limit is 80 pages. We assume that this applies only to Paragraphs 1 (Relevant Experience/Proposed Personnel) and 2 (Relevant Past Performance), and that the pricing submission is excluded from the page count. Is this correct? 
Answer:
See answer to question # 13 above.
Question 28:
May we include a table of contents, cover letter, cover page, list of figures, and acronym list outside of the 80 page limit?
Answer:
See answer to question #13 above.
Question 29:
The RFP states, ?Offerors are encouraged to submit your proposal electronically??  Please confirm that it is acceptable for offerors to submit only an electronic version of their proposal, and that hard copies are not required.
Answer:
That is correct; a hard copy is not required.  Electronic submission is highly recommended.  HOWEVER, it is incumbent upon the offeror to ensure that their proposal is received by the Government PRIOR to the deadline.  
Question 30:
The solicitation states that offerors are to use the RFP?s estimated T&M ceiling prices in their price proposal.  Later, in the next paragraph, the solicitation requests a quote for the T&M CLINs using labor types/categories, price per hour, and total number of hours proposed.  
Question:
a) Are the offerors to base their ceiling prices on the stated CLIN ceilings or the build-up of rates, hours etc, as these appear to be mutually exclusive requirements?
Answer:
The solicitation stated a historical estimate of not to exceed ceiling for Time and Material CLINs for the offeror?s use in establishing its own proposed estimates for the Time and Material CLINs.  There are not stated ceiling CLINS, but estimates for your guidance in determining your own approach to the requirements.
Question:
b) Will the Government be providing a level of effort to base the pricing for the T&M CLINs?  
Answer:
Please see answer to question above.
Question:
c) In absence of a level of effort in order to propose a total number of hours for T&M CLINs 00003, 10002, 20002, 30002, 40002 (Technical Analysis Support) and CLINs 00004, 10003, 20003, 30003, 40003 (Program Management Support), will the Government please provide a basis of estimate, such as workload requirements, for this IDIQ task order contract? 
Answer:
The offerors shall use the estimated ceiling amounts for the CLINs that were provided as a basis for the requirements.     
Question 31:
The RFP does not include requirements for CLIN 00001 ? Transition-in Support Services and CLIN 40004 ? Transition-out Support Services, which are Firm Fixed Price. Please provide the requirements for these specific CLINs.
Answer:
See answer to question #16 above.
Question 32:
The RFP does not include CLINs for Option Period 5.  Request that the CLINs be provided for Option Period 5. Additionally, should CLIN 40004 ? Transition-out Support Services be included in Option Period 5?  Please clarify. 
Answer:
See answer to question #16 above.
Question 33:
Solicitation instructions refer offerors to FAR 52.212-5 (b) and indicate the additional FAR clauses applicable to this procurement are 1; 5; and 14-23.
Clause 5 refers to FAR 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (JUNE 2003) (15 U.S.C. 644). 
Clause 14 refers to FAR 52-219-27 Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside (MAY 2004).
These two references appear to be in conflict with each other. 
Request a clarification regarding set-aside status, if any, for this procurement.  
Answer:
See answer to question #18 above.
Question 34:
What is the Government?s minimum requirement for full-time staff at any Coast Guard location in support of any element of this RFP? 
Answer:

Question 35:
Is the Government receptive to an offering of mobile training teams and a less robust staff presence? 
Answer:
Mobile training teams are acceptable for some of the training requirements.   However, MTTs will not satisfy the requirement for permanent staff presence required to execute the technical support and program management functions of the stated requirements.
Question 36:
Will the Government supply the FY2008 Coast Guard training schedule for the courses requested under this proposal?  
Answer:
The current schedule that is anticipated for FY2008 is:
Basic Tactical Operations Course 28 Apr ? 13 Jun 08
Basic Tactical Operations Course 23 Jun ? 08 Aug 08
Advanced Tactical Operations Course 11 Aug ? 05 Sep 08 (This course will more than likely be replaced by a Basic Tactical Operations Course 11 Aug ? 26 Sep 08)

Question 43:
Clarification: Travel is a separate ceiling price mentioned by the Government to be included as a ceiling price per this contract and not to be included in our cost proposal for each training session.  Is that the correct interpretation? 
Answer:
Travel should be a separate CLIN and the stated ceiling prices should be used and incorporated into your proposal.
Question 44:
Is it possible to receive a list of interested parties for a possible partnering effort?
Answer:
Unfortunately, we the USCG do not hold a bidder list, therefore, we do not have a list of interested parties.

Confidential business information may include technical data as that term is defined in DFARS ýýýý 252.227-7013(a)(14), 252.227-7015(a)(4), and 252.227-7018(a)(19). It may also include computer software as that term is defined in DFARS ýýýý 252.227-7014(a)(4) and 252.227-7018(a)(4). (b) The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) may release to individuals employed by SPAWAR support contractors and their subcontractor's confidential business information submitted by the contractor or its subcontractors pursuant to the provisions of this contract. Business information that would ordinarily be entitled to confidential treatment may be included in the information released to these individuals. Accordingly, by submission of a proposal or execution of this contract, the offeror or contractor and its subcontractors consent to a limited release of its confidential business information. (c) Circumstances where SPAWAR may release the contractor's or subcontractors' confidential business information include the following:  (1) To other SPAWAR contractors and subcontractors, and their employees tasked with assisting SPAWAR in handling and processing information and documents in the administration of SPAWAR contracts, such as file room management and contract closeout. (2) To SPAWAR contractors and subcontractors, and their employees tasked with assisting SPAWAR in accounting support services, including access to cost- reimbursement vouchers. (d)  SPAWAR recognizes its obligation to protect the contractor and its subcontractors from competitive harm that could result from the release of such information. SPAWAR will permit the limited release of confidential business information under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) only under the following conditions: (1) SPAWAR determines that access is required by other SPAWAR contractors and their subcontractors to perform the tasks described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2), (2) Access to confidential business information is restricted to individuals with a bona fide need to possess, (3) Contractors, their subcontractors, and their employees who are granted access to confidential business information have signed an appropriate non- disclosure agreement requiring them to provide the same level of protection to confidential business information that would be provided by SPAWAR employees, (4) Contractors and their subcontractors having access to confidential business information have agreed under their contract or a separate corporate non- disclosure agreement to provide the same level of protection to confidential business information that would be provided by SPAWAR employees, and (5) SPAWAR contractors and their subcontractors performing the tasks described in paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) have agreed under their contract or a separate non-disclosure agreement to not use confidential business information for any purpose other than performing the tasks described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2). (e) SPAWAR's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act are not affected by this clause. (f) If SPAWAR satisfies the conditions listed in paragraph (d), the contractor and its subcontractors agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Government, its agents, and employees from every claim or liability, including attorneys fees, court costs, and expenses, arising out of, or in any way related to, the misuse or unauthorized modification, reproduction, release, display, or disclosure of confidential business information provided by the contractor to the Government. (g) The contractor agrees to include, and require inclusion of, this clause in all subcontracts at any tier that requires the furnishing of confidential business information. H-360  STATE SALES TAX EXEMPTION (OCT 2003) (a) The contractor's price shall not include state sales tax, unless the location of the contractor's business is in a state that does not afford the Federal Government a tax exemption status under its state and local laws (e.g., Arizona, Hawaii). The contract price excludes all state and local taxes levied on or measured by the contract or sales price of the services or materials furnished under this contract. (b) To the extent that the guidance in FAR Part 31 and DFARS Part 231 applies to this contract, such tax or duty shall not constitute an allowable cost under this contract, unless specifically permitted by the Contracting Officer. (c) Contractors may be taxed by a state or local authority when procuring goods and services for performance of this contract. Such taxation does not constitute a tax levied on the Federal Government; rather it is a tax levied on the contractor for which the contractor is liable. However, the Federal Government is exempt from state and local taxation. Therefore, the contractor shall state separately on its invoices taxes excluded from the contract price, and the contracting officer agrees to either pay the amount of the taxes to the contractor or provide evidence necessary to sustain an exemption. (d) No exemption certificate is required. L-349,  Submission Of Electronic Proposals: (a) Offerors shall also submit their proposals electronically to SPAWAR under the instructions contained in this provision.  Offerors shall submit their signed proposals as either scanned ("TIFF") or "PDF" documents.  Electronic copies shall be submitted via the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central  (SPAWAR E-CC).
