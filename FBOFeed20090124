<DESC>This procurement is Full and Open Competition.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The small business size standard is $32.5 million.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is authorized by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. §§5121 et seq.)(Stafford Act), to provide assistance to applicants of Presidentially-declared disasters and emergencies.  FEMA’s Individual Assistance (IA) Program provides temporary housing assistance to disaster applicants in accordance with the Act.  In order to accomplish its mission, FEMA requires nationwide Individual Assistance-Technical Assistance Contract (IA-TAC) services, to include but not limited to, the following tasks: (1)  Site Assessment for potential group sites related to placement of temporary housing; (2)  Site Inspections for potential placement of temporary housing on applicants property; (3)  Staging area support for temporary housing units; (4) Installation of temporary housing units; (5) Group site design for building and placement of temporary housing units; (6) General construction services (e.g. temporary housing of disaster workers or applicants, refurbishment of existing housing units to make habitable); (7)  Facility Management (e.g. manage Disaster Recovery Centers) and (8) limited maintenance of temporary housing units, if required.  The period of performance will be two years from date of award.  FEMA intends to award resulting Performance Based, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), multiple award contracts.  FEMA anticipates that approximately four (4) nationwide contracts will be awarded.  The maximum value of each contract will not exceed $250,000,000 (125 million per year).  Task orders issued (in response to a disaster) under any resulting contracts will be subject to Section 307 of the Stafford Act; this means that the successful contractors will utilize local firms to the maximum extent practical for subcontracting opportunities.  Contract awards will be based on best value where technical factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available only on the Fedbizopps (FBO) web pages at http://www.fbo.gov/.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and attachments, if applicable.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to monitor the Fedbizopps web page for the release of the RFP and any amendments.

<DESC><p>INTERIM NOTICE OF RELEASE OF FINAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) FOR THE LTRS SE&amp;I ACQUISITION
<p>The LTRS SE&amp;I Final RFP was planned for release on 21 January 2009. It is now scheduled for release on or about 27 January 2009. This notice posts the most current Draft Section L and M, and PWS for your use in preparing proposals. Industry Offerors should note the following:</p>
<p>1. The date for early submission of the past performance volume listed in Section L is revised to 6 February 2009 at Noon PST.<br />2. The date for proposals listed in Section L is revised to 23 February 2009 at Noon PST.<br />3. The Government's position on OCI Mitigation is: If you are the Prime contractor on the SE&amp;I effort, you will be unable to participate as a Prime contractor or a Subcontractor on the LISC effort because of the inherent OCI that will exist. The OCI mentioned above cannot be avoided or mitigated due to the tasks that will be required under the SE&amp;I contract as well as the oversight required by the Prime contractor under that contract. If you are a subcontractor on the SE&amp;I contract, under certain circumstances you will still be able to participate in either a Prime or Subcontractor capacity under the LISC contract. The Government will make this determination upon review of the following items: the OCI mitigation plan for the SE&amp;I effort, the OCI mitigation plan for the LISC effort (when proposed), the workload being assigned to the specific SE&amp;I subcontractor and the ability of the Government to assist in mitigating any outstanding OCI issues. <br />4. The incentive plan has been substantially revised to include Government surveillance activities of the contractor (Annex 3); and firm criteria (in Annex 2) were also included for each deliverable listed in Annex 1. In order to receive Mission Success Payment (MSP) you must submit the CDRL on time and meet these criteria.<br />5. Section L, Section M, and the PWS has been substantially revised to ensure everything is cross referenced and complete.</p>
<p>For this acquisition, the anticipated NAICS code is 541712(size standard 1000 employees).</p>
<p>Release of this Draft RFP does not constitute a commitment by the Government. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.</p>
