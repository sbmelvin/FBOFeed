This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 

Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (15) (i), All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 

Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a multiple-award, Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Research, Demonstration, &amp; Information System (RDIS) Information Technology (IT) Development. This procurement is a Competitive 8(a) under FAR 19.805-1(a). The Office of Research, Development, and Information (ORDI), an organization within CMS, provides leadership in producing information and analysis to help shape current and future directions of CMS programs and related policy decisions. ORDI staff helps improve CMS programs through many different approaches such as program data and statistics, Medicare demonstrations, quarterly publications, and many other types of research-related dissemination. End users of ORDI's products include operational and policy staff within CMS, other federal government agencies, research communities, states, providers, health plans, and beneficiaries. ORDI's broad experience and expertise encompass all aspects of research, demonstrations, and policy analysis. They provide many systems to support the full range of research, demonstration, statistics, and dissemination activities. Although ORDI's primary business functions relate to research, Information Technology (IT) provides a key enabler of many of ORDI's core activities. IT is not ORDI's core business, but virtually every interaction between ORDI and their business partners and customers depends on applications, systems, and processes employing IT. This IDIQ is a mechanism to support ORDI's IT objectives by including tasks for all aspects of the IT System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This assemblage of tasks will guide each project to provide support for the design, development, implementation, and maintenance of all current IT systems and any future IT system that ORDI is directed to develop and manage. Each new proposed IT system will be characteristically designed to be scalable, extensible, portable, and provide a framework for constructing IT applications that enable future research, demonstration, and information business processing requirements. All new IT systems will comply with the CMS Target Reference Architecture and the CMS Internet Architecture. The period of performance for the IDIQ is five (5) years. Individual task order's periods of performance shall be based on the individual task order requirements.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the continuation of licensing and maintenance support service of HP/Mercury software.  The anticipated Firm-Fixed Price Contract has a period of three (3) years, a base year with two (2) one-year option periods.
The FAA, Air Traffic Organization, Facilities/Technical Operations, is conducting a Market Survey to determine interest in providing the above service.

At the time of call-in, if an issue/s is not resolved, the support center must provide call back within two hours of the initial call.

<DESC>The San Bernardino National Forest intends to acquire services for the Little Whittle Stewardship contract. The purpose of this project is to reduce hazardous fuels by removing vegetation in fire damaged forest stands.  Beside fuel removal it is desired to attain both horizontal and vertical separation of vegetation within the treatment units.  The project will occur on the Mountaintop Ranger District, San Bernardino National Forest. The project area is Northwest of Big Bear Lake, North of the town of Fawnskin, adjacent to the west property line of the YMCA Camp Whittle.  Reference Fawnskin 7.5 1996 quad map, Section 3 of Township 2 North, Range 1 west , and west of the San Bernardino Baseline Meridian. 
Currently, the estimated size of the project is 160 acres and removal tree diameters may be up to 16 inches. These estimates may increase/decrease on the final solicitation.  

Additionally, hazard trees will be removed on forest lands adjacent to property of a Los Angeles County YMCA Youth Camp.  Restoration of temporary skid trails and un-authorized roads/trails that are used during project implementation will be rehabilitated before project completion.   The hazardous fuels reduction treatments include, but are not limited to cutting, chipping, masticating, piling and removal of dead standing and down trees; thinning of live vegetation and the removal and disposal of existing slash and forest debris.  
Using the stewardship authority of the Integrated Resource Service contract (IRSC) will allow the San Bernardino National Forest to use one contract for fuel reduction, tree and product removal and offset service contract expenses by  trading goods (forest product) for services.
The contractor will be required to purchase the following which are current estimates: 150 cords of fuelwood, 250 tons of biomass, 50 CCF of saw logs, and 75 CCF of useable cull.
There will be at least one pre-solicitation meeting to help understand the process of the IRSC Stewardship contract, this date is yet to be determined, but when confirmed will be added to this announcement. 
This project is, by requirement of the authorizing legislation, not set-aside.  All entities large and small including non-profits may be considered for award.

This solicitation will be available for electronic download on this FEDBIZOPPS site on or around June 23, 2010.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for a Tenney Classic Series Environmental Test Chamber.The primary purpose of purchasing the Environmental Test Chamber is to support SoilMoisture Active passive (SMAP) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) during thedesign, testing, and qualification stages.  The proposed Environmental Test Chamber modelwould allow for a device to be thermally cycled while maintaining a safe relativehumidity environment necessary for ESD sensitive devices.NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Thermal Product Solutions pursuant to FAR13.106 for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably availablefrom only one source. It is our understanding that NASA already owns a license forLinkTenn.  LinkTenn is a piece of software developed by Tidal Engineering specifically toallow users to remotely monitor and control Tenney Environmental Test Chambers directlyfrom a PC.  The software also provides the capability for users to generate genericthermal test profiles that can be used on any other Tenney product.  GPM has alreadydeveloped thermal test profiles that autonomously control the Environmental Test Chamberappropriately depending on the test type and device user test.	It is also ourunderstanding that if a different product were selected, it would be necessary to eithergenerate a new piece of software in-house or procure one with similar functionality.  Inaddition it would require GPM to rewrite each individual thermal test profile using thenew piece of software.	Purchasing a Tenney Environmental Test Chamber would allow thecurrent efforts of both SMAP and GPM to continue consistently while meeting allcompatibility issues.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.This synopsis shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will theGovernment pay for the information solicited.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to GENIA BURTON-PENDERGAST at Rogenia.M.Burton-Penderga@nasa.gov or faxto 301-286-1720 (email preferred), not later than 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (ET) onJune 11, 2010.Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.It is the offeror's responsibility for downloading their own copy of this notice andamendments (if any).An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), to negotiate/award a purchase order to the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) to perform research on the  project entitled Predictors of Smoking in Mexican American Youth.


The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center will collect social network data within the research project entitled Predictors of Smoking in Mexican American Youth.  The current project aims to 1) determine the prevalence of experimentation with cigarettes and alcohol and assess sensation-seeking tendencies, acculturation levels and social network structures in N=1500 unrelated adolescents aged 14 to 17 years at enrollment by completing an in-home interview; 2) assess participants progression from experimentation with tobacco smoking, and alcohol to regular use, and dependence; 3) evaluate how variations in candidate genes, including those related to nicotine and alcohol metabolism, dopamine, serotonin, cannabinoid, opioid receptors and transporters, and genes encoding enzymes involved in synthesis or metabolism of neurotransmitters may influence the initiation, establishment and dependence upon the substances following experimentation; and 4) develop quantitative multivariate risk assessment models for experimentation, initiation and dependence in order to identify high-risk adolescent subgroups. 

The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center will provide the following support on the project:  
Administer the baseline and follow-up assessment surveys to study participants.  
Prepare a dataset for analysis.
. 
The sample for this project is part of an ongoing research protocol.  MDACC has maintained contact with study participants over the past 4 years and has developed a rapport with the families and communities who have participated in the project.  Additionally the Principal Investigator on the study, has a significant understanding of the studys objectives and provides access to study participants.  It would be disruptive to the study for a different project team to conduct the interviews.

	Mosquito uses unique, patented and proven positive displacement disposable tip technology for precise, reliable, repeatable and accurate pipetting of sub-microliter volumes of liquid
	Automated positive displacement pipetting device
	Automated disposable tip based pipetting device capable of accurately delivering nL volumes
	Pipetting device capable of handling wide ranges of liquid viscosities without set-up changes
	Crystallization robot capable of aspirating multiple source liquids and dispensing them simultaneously
	Low volume crystallization robot that does not rely on tip washing and can therefore guarantee zero cross contamination of samples
	LCP robot with small foot print

TTP Labtech, Ltd is the only manufacturer who sells the Mosquito robot.  TTP Labtech has developed a lipid cubic phase robot which has a small foot print, fits anywhere into a laboratory and is user-friendly.  TTP LCP robot will allow NINDS immediately to use the robot productively, providing us with a platform to obtain well-ordered crystals.

The National Park Service (NPS) will be constructing an access road to the Flight 93 National Memorial, Somerset Pennsylvania.  Flight 93 National Memorial is planned to honor the courageous actions of passengers and crew to thwart an attack on the nation's capital and was authorized September 24, 2002.  
This project will provide the primary vehicular access to the new memorial site.  The work in this contract includes the construction of 2.268 miles of roadway from SR 0030 to Flight 93 National Memorial access road. The proposed roadway will follow an abandoned strip mine haul road as much as possible and will consist of 2 - 11' travel lanes with a 5' shoulder on each side.  The shoulders will be full depth pavement.  Additional work includes associated grading, drainage improvements, gates, guardrails, striping and signage.   
Work for this construction project will occur from approximately August 2010 through July 2011.The performance under this construction project will be challenging due to several steady constraints such as the contractor's ability to provide all transportation to and from the site, the requirement for work under tight environmental controls and permitting processes due to the abandoned mining activity and adherence to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Transportation specifications. The project site will also be experiencing concurrent work on the National Memorial and requirements to minimize conflicts between multiple contractor operations, Visitors to the Memorial, Memorial Events throughout the calendar year. 
Flight 93 National Memorial is located almost 103 miles Southeast of Pittsburgh.

<DESC>This is a follow up synopsis to previously posted SOURCES SOUGHT N00421-10-NR-55021. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) PMA-273 NAVAL UNDERGRADUATE FLIGHT TRAINING SYSTEMS, Patuxent River, MD has a requirement for tasking and equipment required for Organization, Intermediate, and possibly Depot-level aircraft maintenance and logistics support for the USN T-34, T-44 and T-6 trainer aircraft programs. This support is currently being performed under Contract N00019-06-D-0017 awarded to Sikorsky Support Services, Inc (SSSI). In addition, Contract N00019-10-C-0051 was awarded to L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace, LLC to primarily assist SSSI with on-site scheduled maintenance for both T-34 and T-44 to recover Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) FY10 Pilot Throughput Rate (PTR). The NAVAIR Freedom of Information Action (FOIA) website is available at http://foia.navair.navy.mil.
<p>There are approximately two hundred and seventy-three (273) T-34 aircraft. The T-34 is a single engine, two-place (tandem seat), unpressurized, low-wing, monoplane manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-34 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), FL, Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF), FL, and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC), TX. The T-34 aircraft are also assigned to assorted satellite sites to be used for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) projects, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and as competitive exercise observer platforms at the following satellite sights: NAS Lemoore, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; NAS Oceana, VA; NAF El Centro, CA; ATTC Fort Rucker, AL; Redstone Army Airfield, Huntsville, AL; NAWCAD Patuxent River, MD; Pope AFB Fayetteville, NC; NASA Cleveland, OH; NASA Edwards AFB, CA; and Fort Eustis, VA.</p>
<p>There are approximately fifty-four (54) T-44 aircraft. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are twin-engine, pressurized, fixed-wing, five-place monoplanes manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are identical in airframe and propulsion, but the T-44C avionics have been upgraded to an integrated digital cockpit. The T-44 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC).</p>
<p>There are approximately forty-two (42) T-6A aircraft and twenty (20) T-6B aircraft. The T-6A/B aircraft are single-engine, two-place (tandem seat), pressurized, low-wing, monoplanes manufactured by Hawker Beechcraft Corporation. Both aircraft are powered by a PT6A-68 free turbine turboprop engine, flat rated at 1100 shp, manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Each aircraft is equipped with two Martin-Baker US16LA ejection seats and On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS). The T-6 is the replacement aircraft for the T-34C. The T-6 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF) and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC). The T-6 aircraft are also assigned to satellite sites (noted above for T-34), to be used for RDT&amp;E, production integration testing, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and competitive exercise observer platforms.</p>
<p>THE USN NO LONGER INTENDS TO USE SEAPORT-E TO SOLICIT OFFERS FOR THIS EFFORT AND NOW INTENDS TO USE FULL &amp; OPEN COMPETITIVE PROCEDURES VIA FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES USING SOLICITATION NUMBER N00019-10-R-0069. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. SOLICITATION RELEASE IS ANTICIPATED TO BE IN SEPTEMBER WITH INDUSTRY SITE VISITS TO VIEW THE MATERIAL CONDITION OF AIRCRAFT AFTER SOLICITATION RELEASE. FULL PERFORMANCE IS ANTICIPATED TO COMMENCE BY 1 APRIL 2011. Please continue to monitor this website, as well as the NAVAIR open solicitation website at the following URL http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm for updated information as it becomes available.</p>
<p>Attached hereto is a DRAFT version of the Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) and DRAFT associated documents for industry's review and feedback. The Government has incorporated comments provided during previous PMA 273 industry days and one-on-one sessions, and is receptive to additional ideas to further reduce or limit constraining requirements, approaches to reduce risks, and highlight potential safety, quality, technical or contractual problem areas. While the DRAFT PWS is not a DRAFT Solicitation, comments and recommendations pertaining to any part of the upcoming solicitation, including Sections L and M, as well as general comments on a best value basis for award are welcomed, including any concerns, questions, refinements, or suggestions. Comments on instructions for preparing and presenting proposal volumes on cost, past performance and other subjects are also welcomed. The Government expects to use a best value basis for award, and the Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) reflects areas of interest and concern to the Government. The PMF represents a more focused means of measuring Contractor performance, and measures alignment with the Navy's objectives of Safety, Quality, Sustainment, Performance and ultimately PTR. The Government is seeking input with respect to the notional incentive arrangement itself, and how best to incentivize meeting PTR, which is a critical component of CNATRA's mission.&nbsp; The Government solicits comments, recommendations, and questions that might further align and clarify the understanding between the Government and potential offerors, including whether the PMF is understandable and executable.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the upcoming requirement is intended to include at least a base year with one (1) or two (2) one-year options. The final selection of contract types and the scope of work within each type have not been determined at this time. Fixed price elements are likely to be associated with Total Lifecycle Product Support (TLPS), other than conditional maintenance. Cost reimbursement elements are likely to be associated with conditional maintenance and the parts and consumables. The Government expects to project expenditures for the parts and consumable cost reimbursement elements, based on past experience in the procurement of parts and consumables supporting the PWS. Incentive elements are likely to be associated with attainment of performance measured by the PMF. The Government solicits comments, recommendations, and questions regarding contract type, incentive arrangements, and contract line item structure.</p>
<p><strong>The Government invites industry feedback via written comments, recommendations, and questions, which shall be received no later than 12:00 p.m. EST on 24 June 2010; however, the Government appreciates earlier written submittals. </strong></p>
<p>In addition to the requested written submittals, PMA-273 intends to host one-on-one sessions with industry for those who wish to offer comments and recommendations in person. The intent of the one-on-one sessions is to get meaningful feedback regarding the requirement and the structure of the PWS and PMF. <strong>The one-on-one sessions will be held during the week of 14 June 2010, and shall not be longer than two (2) hours per session.</strong> Attendance for the one-on-one sessions is limited to three attendees per company. This is a no fee event and seating is limited. Contractors are directed not to present proprietary information submitted in writing or presented during the one-on-ones; any information submitted will become Government property and not be returned to the contractor. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this posting. The Government will not reimburse the attendees for any cost associated with participation or attending the one-on-one's. Information and materials submitted in response to this request WILL NOT be returned. Classified material SHALL NOT be submitted. Responses and comments will not be published, nor will they be released.</p>
<p><strong>Any questions concerning this synopsis, and requests for scheduling industry one-on-one's shall be submitted via email to Jessica McGee at Jessica.mcgee@navy.mil. One-on-one's shall be scheduled no later than 4:00 p.m. EST on 9 June 2010. </strong></p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>NOTE: Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for award and payment from any DOD activity. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements for CCR may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423, or by accessing the CCR website at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY.

Preparedness for public health threats is a major goal of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). A severe influenza pandemic has a great potential to cause large numbers of deaths and illnesses over a short time period. A pandemic occurs when there is an antigenic shift in influenza A virus and transmission of a new strain to which most or all of the world's population is susceptible. Three pandemics occurred during the 20th century, the most severe of which, in 1918, caused over 500,000 U.S. deaths and more than 20 million deaths worldwide.  The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, along with recent outbreaks of human disease caused by avian H5, H9, and H7 influenza strains in Asia, Europe, and North America highlight the potential of new strains to be introduced into the population.  Estimates for the next severe pandemic, extrapolating from those of the 20th century, range from about 100,000 to over 2 million deaths in the U.S. alone.

	Influenza antiviral drugs and influenza vaccines are considered a primary means to decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with an influenza pandemic. 

The Department of Health and Human Services through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to support advanced stage development of new antiviral agents for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of pandemic and seasonal influenza leading toward submission of a U.S. approval/licensure application and development of required industrial capacity to support implementation of the influenza antiviral drugs at full production capacity at or before the onset of a pandemic.  HHS is particularly interested in the advanced development of new influenza antiviral agents designed to target novel mechanisms of action or to enhance effects of present classes of influenza antiviral agents, formulated for long term stability, long bioavailability, and simple dosing regimens.  Ultimately, these influenza antivirals shall be produced at one or more Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed domestic manufacturing facilities and shall provide sufficient surge capacity to contribute substantially to U.S. and ideally global antiviral drug needs during an influenza pandemic.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Background:The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is a world leader in the natural and physical sciences. The USGS provides reliable scientific information to describe and understand the earth; minimize the loss of lives and property from natural disasters; manage biological, water, mineral and energy resources; and enhance and protect our quality of life.  The Water Resources Discipline (WRD) of the USGS collects information needed to understand the Nation's water resources.  Groundwater dating is being used widely in the USGS, WRD, through national programs such as the National Water Quality Assessment Program, the Groundwater Resources Program, and in numerous State and local water resources investigations conducted by our Water Science Centers.   One of the most important tools for groundwater dating is based on the radioactive decay of tritium to helium-3 in groundwater.  Further information on the groundwater dating capabilities of the USGS is discussed at http://water.usgs.gov/lab. 
Basic Requirement: The USGS has a requirement for non-personal, laboratory analytical services to provide all plant equipment, labor, and materials necessary for the analysis of dissolved Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, the 3He/4He isotope ratio of dissolved Helium, and dissolved Tritium in water to calculate age.

<DESC>1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  a. General: This requirement is being advertised as an UNRESTRICTED Single Award Task Order Contract, SATOC, for various Architect Engineer (AE) services, construction phase services (CPS) as it relates to the design, professional services, and design services required under this indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract. The SATOC is to support various Military and some Civil Works Construction Projects which are generally within, but not limited to the Southwest Region. It will allow the flexibility to share capacity with other Corps Districts, outside South Western Division (SWD) boundaries, but primarily for the Fort Worth District, at Fort Bliss, TX, and White Sands Missile Range, NM, in accordance with PL 582, Brooks AE Act, and implemented in FAR Part 36.6.  The Southwest Region refers to the geographic area encompassing the States of AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK, and TX.  A firm will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000, $4.5M, in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711.  This announcement is OPEN TO ALL BUSINESSES regardless of size.  The initial contract is anticipated to be awarded on or about October 2010.  A single IDIQ contract may be awarded from this announcement, for a total cumulative estimated value of $95,000,000, $95M, with a minimum guarantee amount of $10,000, for a three year base period and two one year option periods for a total term of five years. The Government anticipates awarding task orders between $3K to $2,000,000. Some task orders may be above the estimated upper limit of the range. There is no guaranteed amount for the two one year option periods.  The intent of this requirement is to award one contract for design and construction phase services as it relates to design and other projects under the $95M contract primarily for the Fort Bliss Expansion Program at Fort Bliss, TX, and for the program at White Sands Missile Range, NM.  Only Architect or Engineering firms may compete for this contract per FAR 36.6.  Price will not be used as a criterion for selection.  Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest.  The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5  ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  An organizational conflict of interest can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement.  When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award.  Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required.  And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. The contractor or their subs may not be part of the Design Builders Engineers and Architects of record on future contracts.  A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract.  However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer.  In the event this contract is used to develop design build supporting documents for use in a design build acquisition (FAR 36.302), the prime AE and sub consultants shall be prohibited from teaming with design build firms to compete in final design build construction solicitation in accordance with FAR 9.505-2. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.  b. Nature of Work: The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders. The Architect Engineer (AE) shall furnish all personnel, services, materials, supplies, office space, and supervision required to fully complete each task order. The AE firm(s) will act as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the U.S. Government and shall in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract furnish all labor and supervisory management required for the performance of the work that will be described in separately issued task order scopes of work. Task Orders issued against the contract awarded under this announcement may be used by other Corps of Engineers offices and other Department of Defense agencies.  c. Contract Award Procedure: The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm Fixed Price Contract. Task Orders issued against the contract awarded under this announcement may be used by other Corps of Engineers offices.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.  If a large business firm is selected for this announcement, it must comply with the FAR 52.219-9 clause regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  The subcontracting goals for the Fort Worth District which will be considered in the negotiation of this acquisition are:  (1) at least 70.0% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB); (2) at least 6.2% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB); (3) at least 7.0% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Women-Owned SB (WOSB); (4) at least 2.0% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned SB; (5) at least 9.8% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with HUBZone SB, and at least 3.5% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Veteran-Owned SB. Additional Subcontracting Goal Considerations: Although the Department of the Army has not assigned goals in the subcontracting category of HBCU/MI, note that both the ISR and SSR Forms for subcontract reporting require other than small prime contractors to include HBCU/MI.  Therefore, the following guidance is provided:  In support of the HBCU/MI Program, contracts awarded that provide for HBCU/MI subcontracting opportunities should include a HBCU/MI subcontracting goal consistent with the anticipated subcontracting opportunities associated with work HBCU/MIs perform. The plan is not required as part of this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations. Before a small disadvantaged business is proposed as a potential subcontractor, they must be certified by the Small Business Administration and registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Failure of a proposed small disadvantaged business to be certified by the Small Business Administration at the time the SF 330 is submitted will result in their elimination as a proposed subcontractor. The Service Contract Act will apply to this acquisition.  Professional Labor Rates will only be increased once every 12 months and any task order issued at any time within the 12-month period must use the rates of the period in which the task order is executed by the Contracting Officer. New rates go into effect only at the end of the 12 month period. The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm Fixed Price contract.  d. Program Intent: The AE firm(s) will act as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the U.S. Government and shall in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract furnish all labor and supervisory management required for the performance of the work that will be described in separately issued task order scopes of work. Design and construction phase services as it relates to design are required to support construction activities and may include tasks supporting projects not yet in construction. The design work under the Military Construction program will be accomplished using the Land Development Engineering model developed for this size program on infrastructure and the Center for Standardization (COS) designs for the primary facilities.  To accomplish the site and infrastructure work, the service of a firm experienced in site design and Land Development Engineering (LDE) is desired.  The use of the terms AE firm and LDE will be synonymous throughout this announcement.  The LDE will become integrated in the government Program Delivery Team.  Task Orders issued under this contract will encompass all aspects of site development, site design, and the site integration.  The LDE will also provide man power to assist the Government with project management and construction management services. The LDE must be able to provide design support and consultant services in various combinations of architectural, structural, civil, mechanical and electrical disciplines. The AE may be required to perform all or part of the following construction management, Request for Proposal preparation, design-bid-build efforts, and infrastructure design and development services.  The specific nature of the work to be performed will be as contained within the individual task order scopes of work (SOW). If construction management services are required for new construction, renovation, repair, and maintenance of government facilities and infrastructure construction, construction management services (as it relates to design) include, but are not limited to, quality assurance during construction, program management of construction team, technical services, assessing technical requirements, design during construction, ensure quality standards are met, allocate resources and direct LDE team effort, Develop LDE specific procedures and training programs, assist in development operation and implementation to meet objectives, review material submittals, review of LEED documentation during design and construction,  provide training for LEED during construction, review of as-built drawings, manuals, operating instructions, and other such materials required by the construction contract; constructability reviews of design drawings and specifications.  Additional Program Information: The Corps of Engineers Centers of Standardization (COS) will be used for the construction of barracks, dining facilities, company operation facilities, headquarters buildings, vehicle maintenance shops, unit and ammunition storage facilities, aviation facilities, and equipment parking areas and other features of the program.  Under the COS process, Districts within the Corps of Engineers are assigned certain types of facilities and are responsible for awarding Design Build IDC contracts for their assigned type of facility.  When there is a requirement for a particular facility the LDE team may be asked to assist in the development of the Request for Proposal and any other work in support of the award of a construction task order to acquire the required facilities.  The COS may assist with the administration of the task order to include design reviews, submittals modifications, and maintain responsibility for keeping up with the current standards and criteria for their facility types.  The LDE will integrate and coordinate all infrastructure and site development facilities for each site.  The LDE may also be tasked to coordinate and work with the COS standard model RFP.  e. Place of Performance:  The majority of the AE staff directly supporting the USACE Program Director, the Project Managers, and the associated construction office team through project integration and construction management services shall be located in the general proximity where the construction is being accomplished. In some cases, the on-site LDE staff will be housed in government furnished office space.  The physical location of the design team and those team members not directly supporting the onsite work can be located per the A Es preference.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs James A. Haley VA (JHVAHCS) Healthcare System, Tampa, Florida intends to solicit proposal from contractors in the metropolitan Tampa, Florida area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program. The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about 7 June 2010, with a closing date for proposals on or about June, 2010. The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.

The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services.

Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 2-week period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about 1 July, 2010.  Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for four additional one-year terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA.   

The government will use a best value source selection method under Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and anticipates making multiple awards of fixed price, indefinite delivery, and indefinite quantity contracts for this requirement.

NAICS Code is 624229 and the solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration data base at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Support Services Management Office (AAC/ENRS), Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB Florida is interested in receiving information relating to a potential Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) program to provide a variety of engineering and technical acquisition management disciplines for the Air Armament Center (AAC) at Eglin AFB, AAC-associated organizations at other locations, and other organizations located at Eglin AFB. The program will be the follow-on to the current Technical and Engineering Acquisition Support (TEAS) V Program which is scheduled to conclude on 10 Dec 2011. TEAS 6 (5-year follow-on program), with an approximate total value of $500M, will require support of approximately 700 Contractor Man-Year Equivalents (CMEs) per year to advise and assist the AAC's development, testing, acquisition, and sustainment of integrated air-delivered munitions. AAC has the collective Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) mission responsibility for research, development, test and evaluation, sustainment and acquisition of a vast array of Air Force conventional and nuclear munitions, missiles and other related systems and subsystems. Additionally, the TEAS 6 support is expected to address emerging AAC requirements including: transition to air armament products of directed energy technologies, weapons to counter hard and deeply buried targets, weapons to counter mobile threat targets; Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Net Ready Weapons, Counter Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE), Universal Aircraft Interface (UAI), Miniature/Micro Munitions and Persistent Area Dominance (PAD). The TEAS Program will provide a broad range of technical disciplines to support these requirements, to include aeronautical, electrical, mechanical, materials, environmental, and systems engineering, as well as physics, computer science and operations research. Sources responding to this Request for Information (RFI) should identify any information which will enable the Government to determine industries' interest in supporting the TEAS 6 A&amp;AS requirements. RFI responses will contribute to the Market Research Report as part of the acquisition strategy development process. Currently, the acquisition strategy has not been determined. Sources responding are invited to provide input into the acquisition strategy, including development of the source selection evaluation criteria. Additionally, recommendations concerning contract type, contract clauses, other aspects of the acquisition strategy; and anything else that would help in defining an efficient and effective acquisition program, are requested. Once an acquisition strategy has been selected and approved, a draft RFP will be incrementally posted on FedBizOpps prior to the release of the formal RFP. The TEAS V Performance Work Statement (PWS) is being posted on FedBizOpps with the release of this notice to provide information concerning the general scope of the program. A new PWS will be developed as part of the acquisition strategy for the TEAS 6 Program. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a RFP or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.

<DESC>VISN 3 seeks Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, 8a Business, HUB Zone Business, and Small Business sources capable of implementing a VISN-wide PACS with a single database, such that any image obtained at ANY VISN 3 site is easily accessible from any OTHER VISN 3 site and such that a list of prior imaging exams for any given patient includes imaging exams performed at ALL VISN 3 facilities.  VISN 3 may wish to Regionalize/Federate interpretation of imaging studies across different VISNs or non Philips iSite Radiology PACS vendors and therefore needs a PACS that makes this not only possible, but easy to accomplish with minimal advance notice or complexity to the End User Radiologist or the IT staff to pre-configure.

The proposed PACS shall interface with the VA VistA (via HL7 and/or DICOM) so as to be able to ensure we receive patient and exam information, either directly or through imaging equipment as an intermediary.  The PACS shall then be capable of communicating imaging reports back to the VA VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine package, either directly or via an integrated Radiology Voice Recognition System.

The proposed PACS shall be capable of a high degree of integration with a Radiology Voice Recognition System, such as PowerScribe, Commissure or comparable third party vendor.  The proposed PACS will need to uniquely identify each imaging study, regardless of the site of origin.  Images from the PACS shall be viewable throughout the enterprise via a web-based viewer.  Vendor shall guarantee 99.99% up-time on the system, with financial penalties for non-compliance.  System up-time shall be defined as availability of exam images to the End-User.  Vendors must be able to provide a PACS that will include:  

maintenance and upgrades of all included hardware and software, additional server(s) and storage capacity required to meet the needs of VISN 3, continuous remote monitoring of the PACS hardware and software through a VA-approved VPN connection, location of all equipment on VA premises or other locations as determined by VISN 3, compliance with all applicable VA security and privacy regulations, as well as applicable non-VA laws and regulations, such as HIPAA, and a complete Disaster Recovery solution.

It is anticipated that the contract for these services will begin on October 1, 2010 and be let for one base year and four option years.  

Please submit the following information no later than June 11, 2010 @ 2:00PM (EST) to Stephanie Morreale, Contracting Officer via email at stephanie.morreale@va.gov or mail at James J. Howard OPC, 970 Rt. 70, Brick, NJ 08724:
 
(1) Capability Statement;
(2) A list of your last three relevant contracts with a point of contact for each. Please note that these contacts may be called and used as a reference.
 
This is not a request for proposals and no award will be made as a result of submissions in response to this request.  The Department of Veterans Affairs is not responsible for preparation or transmission costs.

This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research. <br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.<br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to procure operations and management support services to support resolution of NBS accounting and budget issues that may negatively impact the NIH NBS funds control implementation on behalf of the National Institutes of Health. <br />Title: NBS Support Services<br />BACKGROUND
<p>More than a decade ago, National Institutes of Health (NIH) was one of the first Federal agencies to consider the use of commercial enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to support Federal financial management. At the time, NIH realized that it needed to retire its then decades-old Core Accounting System (CAS) and the Administrative Database (ADB), for inventory, procurement, property management, travel, human resources and central accounting. In spite of the systems' ability to handle transactions at NIH, the systems were becoming obsolete and had to be replaced.</p>
<p>In 1999, NIH began developing the business case for the Oracle-based system that is now the NIH Business Systems or NBS. After significant planning efforts and securing funding for the project, NBS implementation began, module by module. The system now provides tremendous capability and functionality to serve the needs of its customers in the NIH Office of the Director (OD) and across its 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs).</p>
<p>Although NBS now serves as the system of record for the many transactions produced at NIH each day, vision for the system has yet to be fully achieved. Enhancements to the system, its environment and the financial management practices in use at NIH require renewed efforts to develop the world class management capabilities needed to support the world's leading medical research institution. At present, legacy systems are still in use and must be retired to eliminate redundancies, minimize costs and improve financial management and internal control. Other systems within NIH and at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) have yet to have their financial transaction integrated with NBS. For example, the agency's electronic Research Administration (eRA) Information for Management, Planning, Analysis and Coordination (IMPAC II) system, which processes 55,000 grant funding transactions each year, is operated by the Office of Extramural Research (OER). Failure to integrate financial aspects of this the system with NBS perpetuates weaknesses in financial controls for the nearly $25 billion in grants payments made each year. The addition of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding - nearly $10.5 billion at NIH - has significantly increased the amount of grant funding, the number of grant payments processed and the risk associated with having a grants management system that does not have its financial transactions directly integrated with NBS.</p>
<p>Enhancements to the system, its environment and the financial management practices in use at NIH require renewed efforts to develop the world class management capabilities needed to support the world's leading medical research institution. These enhancements are now planned as a series of projects collectively known as the NIH Healthier Financial Management Initiatives (HFMI).</p>
<p>Recently, several driving factors have converged on the NBS Program, which together call on the NBS Program Office to pragmatically consider a number of major financial management initiatives:</p>
<p>Audit findings have noted that the NIH continues to operate NBS without systemic funds checking enabled. Thus, the NBS Program must implement funds checking to prevent Anti-Deficiency Act violations, comply with emerging OMB and treasury requirements and ensure audit compliance.</p>
<p>Congress has required NIH to institute reprogramming controls at the sub-mechanism level. The 2010 Congressional appropriation defined funds control/funds management requirements for NIH. The language requires funds control at the sub-mechanism level, which is a component of the NBS Account Code Structure (ACS) that is not fully enabled for NIH in that the sub-mechanism values have not been fully created or used consistently in account combinations. NIH is currently in conversation with the Appropriations Committee to set the time line for achieving business process and accounting system reprogramming controls. The efforts in this current project will consider this evolving situation and ensure that decisions in system development advance (or at a minimum do not hinder) NIH's capability to implement Congressionally directed controls.</p>
<p>Under combined resources from the 2009 economic stimulus funding (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) and the annual appropriations provided for NBS activities, NIH determined that enhancing the integration of its independent grant and accounting enterprise systems could address these driving factors and significantly improve enterprise operations and support national goals of greater governmental transparency.</p>
<p>This improvement effort consists of a group of interrelated projects referred to as the NIH Healthier Financial Management Integration (HFMI). HFMI consists of the following projects.</p>
<p>o Funds Control - Implement funds management functionality to achieve Anti-deficiency Act compliance)<br />o MAS Retirement - Retire MAS/CAN Maintenance <br />o Grants Integration - Integrate financial aspects of IMPACII-NBS</p>
<p>o Strategies for implementing the Common Government-wide Accounting Classification (CGAC)<br />o Integrate Payment Management System (PMS) with NBS<br />o Implement Oracle Projects<br />o Integrate Payroll-NBS</p>
<p>The HFMI design, development and implementation was procured under a separate contract and is not part of this requirement. This effort is intended to resolve accounting and budget issues that could hamper the implementation of these initiatives.<br />Specific Tasks</p>

<a href="mailto:Maria.Nailat@navy.mil">Primary Point of Contact</a>
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal.
The Department of the Navy (DoN) seeks to identify interest and sources for potentially developing renewable energy generation or production facilities at Naval Air Station (NAS) Lemoore compatible with the station's operational mission.  
NAS Lemoore is an active military installation, and is the Navy's newest, largest, and only west coast Master Jet base. Its principal mission is to support Strike-Fighter Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet and its mission to train, man, and equip west coast Strike-Fighter squadrons.
NAS Lemoore has identified ten individual parcels totaling approximately 2,900 acres for potential renewable energy generation facilities.  Descriptions of the sites are included as Attachment 1 to this notice, and maps of the sites are included as Attachments 2-4.  A map of the NAS Lemoore 69 kV electrical substation and buildings with significant heat loads in the immediate vicinity of the substation is also included as Attachment 5.
Other resources potentially available include untreated wastewater generated at NAS Lemoore that is currently transferred to the wastewater lagoons on a daily basis.  
Electricity load, consumption and cost data for NAS Lemoore and Department of Navy (DoN) Southwest, for calendar year 2009 is as follows:
Annual Consumption	Peak Load     Avg	                            Cost of Power	          (GWh)	  (MW)	         (per kWh)NAS Lemoore	   180	   18	          $0.03-$0.06DoN Southwest	 1,400	  300	          $0.11-$0.14
The DoN will consider opportunities to host the private development of large-scale renewable energy generation facilities, in accordance with 10 USC 2667, 10 USC 2916, and/or 10 USC 2922a.
The DoN is seeking information on developments that would generate power for sale on the wholesale market, for local consumption at NAS Lemoore, and/or for consumption at other DoN installations in the southwest via an interagency agreement with the Western Area Power Administration.  
The DoN seeks interest in the private development of renewable energy facilities to enhance NAS Lemoore energy security and to potentially reduce energy and other costs at NAS Lemoore as well as other DoN installations in the southwest.  The DoN will consider a wide range of opportunities, including renewable electricity generation, alternative fuel production, use of process heat to replace fossil fuel heat sources, and others.  Further, the DoN will consider proposals that include Government purchase of the energy, wholesale generation or production, distributed generation, or a combination of those options.
The specific information the DoN seeks at this time is:
(1)	Name and brief description of company
(2)	Capability and pertinent experience 
(3)	The renewable resources and technologies that maximize the land opportunity and benefits to NAS Lemoore and DoN.
(4)	The size and capacity of the generation asset that maximizes the land opportunity.

___________________________________________________

     NAS Lemoore Renewable Energy Generation Sites

Ten sites containing a total of approximately 2,900 usable acres net of roads and drainage have been identified by NAS Lemoore (NASL) as potentially available for development of renewable energy.  Eight of the ten sites are formerly agricultural lease parcels, one is a capped landfill Installation Restoration site and the last is the site of the existing wastewater treatment lagoons which are fed continuously by the base domestic sanitation system.  
The northerly most agricultural site is Parcel 58 which is broken into eight subcomponents.  It is east of the Operational runways.  The remaining parcels are in the most southerly area of the base and eight of the parcels are contiguous (save a small borrow pit area) west of the Administration Area between the San Joaquin Valley Railroad line and State Route 98.  The tenth parcel is NASL's 430 acre sewage treatment lagoons one mile south of the base Administration Area 
Each parcel is Department of the Navy (DoN) fee owned land and has previously been disturbed either by farming using flood irrigation, landfill or sewage treatment activities.  No cultural or natural resources of significance are known to exist in the areas.  Each site is generally flat with less than 2% slope and is surrounded on all sides by all weather roadways of pavement or field access roads of raised compacted earth.  A more precise description of each Parcel follows below, and maps of the sites are included as Attachments 2-5.

Parcel 58 
Parcel 58 contains approximately 1,292 acres and five irrigation wells and is subdivided into 8 sub-parcels.  These parcels have relatively high levels of alkali and salts.  They are not included in the Westlands water district and have no source of water other than the wells.  NRCS ratings of Farmland of Statewide importance applies to these lands. 

Parcel 22a 
Site 22a is approximately 77 acres in size and is trapezoidal in shape.  Its northwesterly border runs along the San Joaquin Valley railroad right of way for a distance of approximately 2,877 lineal feet (LF), its easterly border is approximately 1,817 LF along a raised field access road, its Southerly border is also along a field access road for approximately 2,548 LF and its westerly border is 642 LF along the westerly boundary of NASL's Administration area.  

Parcel 23
Parcel 23 is an irregular polygon containing approximately 197 acres.  It is adjacent and east of Parcel 22a above.  Its northwesterly border runs along the San Joaquin Valley railroad right of way for a distance of approximately 3,951 LF, its easterly border is approximately 2,697 LF along Reeves Boulevard.  Its southeasterly border is along a field access road for approximately 2,162 LF and then bends around the rectangular boundary of the capped landfill which intrudes into the parcel with borders of 1,408 LF, 2,039 LF and 1,191 respectively from east to west.  


Parcel 24  Parcel 24 is roughly square shaped containing approximately 155 acres.  It is adjacent and south of Parcel 22a above.  Its borders from northerly to westerly in a clockwise rotation measure approximately 2,548 LF; 2,516 LF; 2,519 LF and 2,423 LF respectively.  Its southerly border runs along state route 98.  Its southerly & westerly borders run along the boundary of NASL's southerly and westerly property line.
Parcel 25
Parcel 25 is roughly square shaped containing approximately 148 acres.  It is adjacent and east of Parcel 24 above.  Its northerly border runs along the southern edge of the capped landfill for a distance of approximately 2,430 LF with a relatively small jog north around the southwesterly boundary of the landfill.  From easterly to westerly boundaries in a clockwise rotation measure approximately 2,258 LF, 2,568 LF, 2,516 LF respectively.  Its southerly border runs along state route 98.  

Parcel 26
Parcel 26 is polygon containing approximately 230 acres.  It is adjacent and south of Parcel 23 above.  Its northerly border is adjacent to the southern border of Parcel 23.  Its eastern border is curvilinear and runs along Reeves Boulevard for a distance of approximately 4,429 LF.  Its southerly border runs along State Route 98 for a distance of approximately 4,677 LF.  Its westerly border is adjacent and runs along the easterly border of Parcel 25 above for a distance of approximately 2,610 LF with a relatively short jog around the southwesterly border of the capped landfill.

Parcel 27
  Site 27 is approximately 135 acres in size and is trapezoidal in shape.  Its northerly border runs along an elevated compacted earthen field access road for a distance of approximately 3,694 LF.  Its easterly and southerly borders are approximately 1,500 LF and 2,554 LF respectively and are adjacent to the developed area of NASL's Administration Area.  Its westerly border runs along Reeves Boulevard for approximately1,908 LF.   The southeast corner of this site is approximately 500 LF from the 69kV substation serving the NASL Administration Area.  

Parcel 28
  Site 28 is approximately 183 acres in size and is trapezoidal in shape.  Its northerly border runs along San Joaquin Valley railroad right of way for a distance of approximately 4,640 LF.  Its easterly border runs along the NASL property line boundary for approximately 2,831 LF.  The southerly border runs along the elevated compacted earthen field access road along the northerly border of Parcel 27 above for a distance of approximately 3,694 LF.  The westerly border runs along Reeves Boulevard for a distance of approximately 926 LF.  

Capped Landfill 
The landfill was used by NAS Lemoore for 30 years from 1961-1991 and it contains approximately 54 acres.   It is surrounded by Parcel 23 above on the west, north and east with borders of 1,191; 2,039; and 1,408 respectively.  Its southern border is 1,924 LF along the northerly border of parcel 25 above.   It is currently in the Installation Restoration Program and Its existing water and soil gas monitoring wells will remain active for the foreseeable future.  However, after closure of the landfill, the Navy initiated investigations to determine whether there had been releases from the landfill.  No consistent pattern of groundwater contamination was discovered, even though the rising water table had saturated the waste for many years.  Instead, chemicals in groundwater were detected sporadically and at low concentrations during years of groundwater sampling for the remedial investigation (1991 through 1996).  The Record of Decision concluded that the presence of refuse in direct contact with shallow groundwater had resulted in only limited migration of contaminants to groundwater.  The Record of Decision also concluded that there were no current risks to human health and the environment because exposure pathways for soil contamination were incomplete because soil contamination was well below the surface and exposure pathways for groundwater were incomplete because the upper aquifer is not used for domestic or drinking water purposes.  NAS Lemoore Wastewater Lagoons
NASL's Wastewater Lagoons parcel is in the shape of an irregular 5 sided polygon contain approximately 430 acres.  It contains 2 smaller settling ponds and 3 larger evaporation ponds.  Historically, approximately 2 million gallons of untreated sewage has been collected daily in the NASL Administration area and pumped in to the settling ponds.  The effluent from the settling ponds is transferred into the evaporation ponds in compliance with local water permits.

The NAICS code is 541330.<br /><br />The AFFTC has a requirement to provide the 412 Test Wing (TW) access to Boeing Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Block 30/35 and 40/45 high fidelity Hardware in the Loop Aircraft Simulators, F-15 and F-18 High Fidelity Labs (HFL), J-UCAV, F-22, Apache, DDX surface vehicles, B-2, and B-52 simulators integrated into a common Network Centric Warfare (NCW) simulated environment. The government reserves the right to request utilization of new simulators as they become available.

These simulators will be tasked to participate in defined test scenarios to support AFFTC testing. In these test scenarios, these simulators will be programmed to send and receive TDL data link messages per the scenario. Data will be recorded to analyze message traffic between all systems within the network of systems (both live and virtual) participating in the test.
<p>Contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Government's requirement. In addition, the response should include any special requirements for a commercial contract (i.e., Commercial Financing, Warranty Provisions, Delivery Information, etc.) in accordance with FAR Part 12.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO EXTEND REMEDIATION SERVICES CONTRACT DE-AC24-05OH20192
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:rj.bell@lex.doe.gov">Bell, Robert J</a>
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:  The United States Department of Energy (DOE) intends to extend the current environmental remediation services contract with LATA/Parallax Portsmouth, LLC (LPP) at the Portsmouth site to continue remediation and disposition of specific areas by removing legacy waste, initiating facility decontamination and decommissioning (D&D), disposition of highly enriched uranium, and operating the site waste storage facilities in accordance with all the applicable laws, regulations, DOE Directives, permits, and agreements and Orders.  Disposition is defined in the specific applicable Orders and Agreements.  The proposed contract extension is for 8 months from July 1, 2010 through February 28, 2011.
Environmental remediation services at the Portsmouth site as listed are contemplated as part of the contract extension.  These services include, but are not limited to the following:  
-  Quadrant II remedial actions that include removal of the source contaminant at the X-701B groundwater plume 
-  Removal of the foundation, neutralization pit, and characterization of the contaminated soils at X-760 inactive facilities 
-  Repackaging and disposition of uranium materials 
-  Soil characterization of the X-630 and the X-633 areas
-  Soil characterization and remediation of the X-747K area
-  Demolition and characterization of the X-103, X-230J9, X-334, X-344B, X-605H, -I, -J, and X-630, inactive facilities
-  Post remediation surveillance and maintenance of groundwater treatment facilities
-  Environmental monitoring and reporting of on-site and off-site air, soils and water 
-  National Environmental Policy Act compliance, cultural resource surveys including but not limited to Phase II Archeological surveys, and radiological surveys in support of building returns from United States Enrichment Corporation, and reindustrialization/reuse of equipment and real property
-  Disposition of highly enriched uranium including the oversight of the D&D of the process line at Nuclear Fuel Services (NFS) -  Maintenance and disposition of existing uranium materials 
-  Down blending and disposal of the Filter Ash and Oil Leak Gunk
-  Disposition of two (2) sealed sources located in the X-103 Building

-  Administrative services not limited to management, public affairs, financial, legal, procurement, program management, taxes, public information, support to DOE, Site Specific Advisory Board support, human resource management, and diversity commensurate to support the contractor's scope of work 
-  Transportation services including, but not limited to, shipments of hazardous or radioactive waste generated from the D&D and remediation activities, laboratory or sample shipments, required scale calibrations, vehicle and equipment maintenance, and management
- Records management, safeguards and security, and property management 
The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is the Competition in Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The present contact with LPP is due to expire on June 30, 2010.  The proposed contract extension will allow environmental remediation activities to continue at the Portsmouth site until completion of the on-going D&D procurement and transition to a new contractor.  The extension will help stabilize the current workforce at the Portsmouth site by avoiding layoffs as well as reducing severance costs that  would be borne by the Government.  
As far as DOE is aware, LPP as the incumbent site environmental remediation contractor is the only contractor who has unique qualifications to continue the necessary environmental remediation activities at the Portsmouth site without a break in service until award is made of the on-going competitive.  DOE anticipates award will be made in the 1st quarter of Fiscal Year 2011 as published on the DOE EM Acquisition Forecast website (last updated 10/13/2009).   THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS UNDER FAR PART 12, 15, OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS UNDER FAR PART 14.  IF PARTIES CHOOSE TO RESPOND, ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONDENT AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Interested parties believing they have all of the capabilities may submit capability statements to provide all of the services, including a demonstration of the ability to meet all of the needs identified above within the required timeframes.  The capabilities statement describing and demonstrating the above shall be submitted within 15 days of publication of this notice to the following address:  U.S. Department of Energy, Portsmouth/Paducah Project Office, 1017 Majestic Drive, Suite 200, Lexington, KY 40513, ATTENTION:  Robert J.

This notice is provided for information purposes only.  This opportunity is only available to the contractor under Contract AG-3A75-C-09-0019

A task order will be issued to HDR Engineering for independent design review of an ARRA Rehabilitation project in the state of Georgia located at Marbury Site 22.  

The Contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described herein:

I. Purpose

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDANatural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard  The Contractors capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to verify that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall verify that the design:  

	Addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies
	Safely and effectively meets the stated objectives  
	Addresses unique site conditions 
	Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures
	Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.  (Note: A waiver of NRCS hydrologic design criteria has been granted to allow modification of this dam to Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, Safe Dams Program hydrologic criteria.)

The Department of Health and Human Services/Office of Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation through the Program Support Center intends to issue a Request for Task Order Proposal under the PSC Task Order Contracts for Enhancing the Adoption of Comparative Effectiveness Research in the Treatment of Serious Mental Illnesses in Medicaid.

The main objective of this project is to improve the treatment of people with serious mental illnesses by investigating the extent to which evidence-based practices are employed in the treatment of Medicaid enrollees who have either schizophrenia or bi-polar disorder. This project will identify the combinations of benefit design, payment and organizational arrangements that best support the use of evidence-based practices. It will review the literature, analyze Medicaid claims and enrollment data to better understand how states currently treat schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder, and assess how current treatment patterns compare with evidence-based practices. States will be selected that have relatively complete claims and enrollment data, reflect a range of likely performance, and represent a mix of the design features that are likely to influence performance. It is anticipated that the CMS Medicaid Analytical Extract (MAX) data will be used to carry out this project. The task order is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 from the Office of the Secretary Comparative Effectiveness Research Funds.

No solicitation will be posted and capability statements are NOT being requested.

A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL OF THE PSC TASK ORDER CONTRACTORS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FAIR OPPORTUNITY.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT ONE FIXED PRICE AWARD SHALL BE MADE.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-08-C-0013<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification using Recovery Act funding to contract number W91278-08-C-0013, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Allatoona Lake and Dam Project, Cartersville, Georgia, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815 Hennessey, OK.  The modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for to: Clean (no abatement) and paint nine (9) 40' x 26' radial spillway gates and two (2) 20' x 26' radial spillway gates.  <BR><BR>This existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to starting the work. 2) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance, and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contain specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers.

<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>

<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the <br />Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued under this clause.

<p>(1) Cancel the stop-work order; or</p>
<p>(2) Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the Government, clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled either before or after a final decision in the protest, the Contractor shall resume work. The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if--</p>
<p>(1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor asserts its right to an adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal at any time before final payment under this contract.</p>
<p>(c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement.</p>
<p>(d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order.</p>
<p>(e) The Government's rights to terminate this contract at any time are not affected by action taken under this clause.</p>
<p>(f) If, as the result of the Contractor's intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2) or 33.104(h)(1), the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs. In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of Subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between the Contractor and the Government.</p>

<p>H.10 ADP SYSTEMS SECURITY REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The central tenet of the CMS Information Security (IS) Program is that all CMS information and information systems shall be protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, duplication, modification, diversion, destruction, loss, misuse, or theft-whether accidental or intentional. The security safeguards to provide this protection shall be risk-based and business-driven with implementation achieved through a multi-layered security structure. All information access shall be limited based on a least-privilege approach and a need-to-know basis, i.e., authorized user access is only to information necessary in the performance of required tasks. Most of CMS' information relates to the health care provided to the nation's Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and as such, has access restrictions as required under legislative and regulatory mandates. <br />The CMS IS Program has a two-fold purpose: <br />(1) To enable CMS' business processes to function in an environment with commensurate security protections, and <br />(2) To meet the security requirements of federal laws, regulations, and directives.<br />The principal legislation for the CMS IS Program is Public Law (P.L.) 107-347, Title III, Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf. FISMA places responsibility and accountability for IS at all levels within federal agencies as well as those entities acting on their behalf. FISMA directs Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through the Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to establish the standards and guidelines for federal agencies in implementing FISMA and managing cost-effective programs to protect their information and information systems. As a contractor acting on behalf of CMS, this legislation requires that the Contractor shall:<br />&bull; Establish senior management level responsibility for IS,<br />&bull; Define key IS roles and responsibilities within their organization,<br />&bull; Comply with a minimum set of controls established for protecting all Federal information, and<br />&bull; Act in accordance with CMS reporting rules and procedures for IS.<br />Additionally, the following laws, regulations and directives and any revisions or replacements of same have IS implications and are applicable to all CMS contractors.<br />&bull; P.L. 93-579, The Privacy Act of 1974, http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/privstat.htm , (as amended);<br />&bull; P.L. 99-474, Computer Fraud &amp; Abuse Act of 1986, www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/ccmanual/01ccma.pdf P.L. 104-13, Paperwork Reduction Act of 1978, as amended in 1995, U.S. Code 44 Chapter 35, www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/paperwork-reduction;<br />&bull; P.L. 104-208, Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (formerly known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act), http://www.cio.gov/Documents/it_management_reform_act_Feb_1996.html; <br />&bull; P.L. 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (formerly known as the Kennedy-Kassenbaum Act) http://aspe.hhs.gov/admnsimp/pl104191.htm;<br />&bull; OMB Circular No. A-123, Management's Responsibility for Internal Control, December 21, 2004, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a123/a123_rev.html;<br />&bull; OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Transmittal 4, November 30, 2000, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130trans4.html; <br />&bull; NIST standards and guidance, http://csrc.nist.gov/; and,<br />&bull; Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations, policies, standards and guidance http://www.hhs.gov/policies/index.html<br />These laws and regulations provide the structure for CMS to implement and manage a cost-effective IS program to protect its information and information systems. Therefore, the Contractor shall monitor and adhere to all IT policies, standards, procedures, directives, templates, and guidelines that govern the CMS IS Program, http://www.cms.hhs.gov/informationsecurity and the CMS System Lifecycle Framework, http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework. <br />The Contractor shall comply with the CMS IS Program requirements by performing, but not limited to, the following:<br />&bull; Implement their own IS program that adheres to CMS IS policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines, as well as industry best practices; <br />&bull; Participate and fully cooperate with CMS IS audits, reviews, evaluations, tests, and assessments of contractor systems, processes, and facilities;<br />&bull; Provide upon request results from any other audits, reviews, evaluations, tests and/or assessments that involve CMS information or information systems;<br />&bull; Report and process corrective actions for all findings, regardless of the source, in accordance with CMS procedures;<br />&bull; Document its compliance with CMS security requirements and maintain such documentation in the systems security profile;<br />&bull; Prepare and submit in accordance with CMS procedures, an incident report to CMS of any suspected or confirmed incidents that may impact CMS information or information systems; and<br />&bull; Participate in CMS IT information conferences as directed by CMS.<br />If the contractor believes that an updated IS-related requirement posted to the CMS website may result in a significant cost impact, the contractor may submit a request for equitable cost adjustment before implementing change.<br />H.11 HHSAR 352.270-19 ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY (JAN 2006)</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by Public Law 105-220 under Title IV (Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998) and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194), require that all EIT acquired must ensure that:</p>

<p>e. CMS may disallow any contractor incurred cost that would not be allocated to the approved IT investment acquisition.</p>
<p>H.14 SECURITY CLAUSE -BACKGROUND - INVESTIGATIONS FOR CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL</p>
<p>If applicable, Contractor personnel performing services for CMS under this contract, task order or delivery order shall be required to undergo a background investigation. CMS will initiate and pay for any required background investigation(s).</p>
<p>These provisions may be added to an existing contract, task order or delivery order when it is mutually determined by the CMS Project Officer (PO), the Security and Emergency Management Group (SEMG) and the Contracting Officer (CO) that contractor personnel need access to CMS data and/or facilities to perform the contract.</p>
<p>After the effective date of this contract, task order, or delivery order modification, the PO and SEMG, with the assistance of the Contractor, shall perform a position-sensitivity analysis based on the duties contractor personnel shall perform on the contract, task order or delivery order. The results of the position-sensitivity analysis will determine first, whether the provisions of this clause are applicable to the contract and second, if applicable, determine each position's sensitivity level (i.e., high risk, moderate risk or low risk) and dictate the appropriate level of background investigation to be processed. Investigative packages may contain the following forms:</p>
<p>1. SF-85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, 09/1995<br />2. SF-85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, 09/1995<br />3. OF-612, Optional Application for Federal Employment, 12/2002<br />4. OF-306, Declaration for Federal Employment, 01/2001 <br />5. Credit Report Release Form<br />6. FD-258, Fingerprint Card, 5/99, and <br />7. CMS-730A, Request for Physical Access to CMS Facilities (NON-CMS ONLY), 11/2003.</p>
<p>The Contractor personnel shall be required to undergo a background investigation commensurate with one of these position-sensitivity levels:</p>
<p>1) High Risk (Level 6)<br />Public Trust positions that would have a potential for exceptionally serious impact on the integrity and efficiency of the service. This would include computer security of a major automated information system (AIS). This includes positions in which the incumbent's actions or inaction could diminish public confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned government activities, whether or not actual damage occurs, particularly if duties are especially critical to the agency or program mission with a broad scope of responsibility and authority.</p>
<p>Major responsibilities that would require this level include:</p>
<p>a. development and administration of CMS computer security programs, including direction and control of risk analysis and/or threat assessment;<br />b. significant involvement in mission-critical systems;<br />c. preparation or approval of data for input into a system which does not necessarily involve personal access to the system but with relatively high risk of causing grave damage or realizing significant personal gain;<br />d. other responsibilities that involve relatively high risk of causing damage or realizing personal gain;<br />e. policy implementation;<br />f. higher level management duties/assignments or major program responsibility; or<br />g. independent spokespersons or non-management position with authority for independent action.</p>
<p>Approximate cost of each investigation: $2,900</p>
<p>2) Moderate Risk (Level 5)<br />Level 5 Public Trust positions include those involving policymaking, major program responsibility, and law enforcement duties that are associated with a "Moderate Risk." Also included are those positions involving access to or control of unclassified sensitive, proprietary information, or financial records, and those with similar duties through which the incumbent can realize a significant personal gain or cause serious damage to the program or Department.<br />Responsibilities that would require this level include:</p>
<p>a. the direction, planning, design, operation, or maintenance of a computer system and whose work is technically reviewed by a higher authority at the High Risk level to ensure the integrity of the system;<br />b. systems design, operation, testing, maintenance, and/or monitoring that are carried out under the technical review of a higher authority at the High Risk level;<br />c. access to and/or processing of information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974;<br />d. assists in policy development and implementation;<br />e. mid-level management duties/assignments;<br />f. any position with responsibility for independent or semi-independent action; or<br />g. delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust.</p>
<p>Approximate cost of each investigation: $2,400</p>
<p>3) Low Risk (Level 1)<br />Positions having the potential for limited interaction with the agency or program mission, so the potential for impact on the integrity and efficiency of the service is small. This includes computer security impact on AIS.</p>
<p>Approximate cost of each investigation: $550</p>
<p>The Contractor shall submit the investigative package(s) to the SEMG within three (3) days after being advised by the SEMG of the need to submit packages. Investigative packages shall be submitted to the following address:</p>
<p>Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services<br />Office of Operations Management<br />Security and Emergency Management Group<br />Mail Stop SL-13-15<br />7500 Security Boulevard <br />Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850</p>
<p>The Contractor shall submit a copy of the transmittal letter to the CO.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel shall submit a CMS-730A (Request for Badge) to SEMG (see attachment in Section J). The Contractor and the PO shall obtain all necessary signatures on the CMS-730A prior to any Contractor employee arriving for fingerprinting and badge processing.</p>
<p>The Contractor must appoint a Security Investigation Liaison as a point of contact to resolve any issues of inaccurate or incomplete form(s). Where personal information is involved, SEMG may need to contact the contractor employee directly. The Security Investigation Liaison may be required to facilitate such contact.</p>
<p>SEMG will fingerprint contractor personnel and send their completed investigative package to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM will conduct the background investigation. Badges will not be provided by SEMG until acceptable finger print check results are received; until then the contractor employee will be considered as an escorted visitor. The Contractor remains fully responsible for ensuring contract, task order or delivery order performance pending completion of background investigations of contractor personnel.</p>
<p>SEMG shall provide written notification to the CO with a copy to the PO of all suitability decisions. The PO shall then notify the Contractor in writing of the approval of the Contractor's employee(s), at that time the Contractor's employee(s) will receive a permanent identification badge. Contractor personnel who the SEMG determines to be ineligible may be required to cease working on the contract immediately.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall report immediately in writing to the SEMG with copies to the CO and the PO, any adverse information regarding any of its employees that may impact their ability to perform under this contract, task order or delivery order. Reports should be based on reliable and substantiated information, not on rumor or innuendo. The report shall include the contractor employee's name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel shall be provided an opportunity to explain or refute unfavorable information found in an investigation to SEMG before an adverse adjudication is made. Contractor personnel may request, in writing, a copy of their own investigative results by contacting:</p>
<p>Office of Personnel Management<br />Freedom of Information<br />Federal Investigations Processing Center<br />PO Box 618<br />Boyers, PA 16018-0618.</p>
<p>At the Agency's discretion, if an investigated contractor employee leaves the employment of the contractor, or otherwise is no longer associated with the contract, task order, or delivery order within one (1) year from the date the background investigation was initiated by CMS, then the Contractor may be required to reimburse CMS for the full cost of the investigation. Depending upon the type of background investigation conducted, the cost could be approximately $550 to $2,900. The amount to be paid by the Contractor shall be due and payable when the CO submits a written letter notifying the Contractor as to the cost of the investigation. The Contractor shall pay the amount due within thirty (30) days of the date of the CO's letter by check made payable to the "United States Treasury." The Contractor shall provide a copy of the CO's letter as an attachment to the check and submit both to the Office of Financial Management at the following address:</p>
<p>Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services<br />PO Box 7520<br />Baltimore, Maryland 21207</p>
<p>The Contractor must immediately provide written notification to SEMG (with copies to the CO and the PO) of all terminations or resignations of Contractor personnel working on this contract, task order or delivery order. The Contractor must also notify SEMG (with copies to the CO and the PO) when a Contractor's employee is no longer working on this contract, task order or delivery order.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the contract, task order or delivery order and at the time when a contractor employee is no longer working on the contract, task order or delivery order due to termination or resignation, all CMS-issued parking permits, identification badges, access cards, and/or keys must be promptly returned to SEMG. Contractor personnel who do not return their government-issued parking permits, identification badges, access cards, and/or keys within 48 hours of the last day of authorized access shall be permanently barred from the CMS complex and subject to fines and penalties authorized by applicable federal and State laws.</p>

<p>Notice to Employees</p>
<p>Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs. Under certain conditions, the law permits a union and an employer to enter into a union-security agreement requiring employees to pay uniform periodic dues and initiation fees. However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment.</p>
<p>If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments.</p>
<p>For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its Regional offices or at the following address or toll free number:</p>
<p>National Labor Relations Board<br />Division of Information<br />1099 14th Street, N.W.<br />Washington, DC 20570<br />1-866-667-6572<br />1-866-316-6572 (TTY)</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor shall comply with all provisions of Executive Order 13201 of February 17, 2001, and related implementing regulations at 29 CFR Part 470, and orders of the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<p>(d) In the event that the Contractor does not comply with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), or (g), the Secretary may direct that this contract be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and declare the Contractor ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures at 29 CFR part 470, Subpart B--Compliance Evaluations, Complaint Investigations and Enforcement Procedures. Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided by 29 CFR Part 470, which implements Executive Order 13201, or as are otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p>(e) The requirement to post the employee notice in paragraph (b) does not apply to--</p>
<p>(1) Contractors and subcontractors that employ fewer than 15 persons;</p>
<p>(2) Contractor establishments or construction work sites where no union has been formally recognized by the Contractor or certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of the Contractor's employees;</p>
<p>(3) Contractor establishments or construction work sites located in a jurisdiction named in the definition of the United States in which the law of that jurisdiction forbids enforcement of union-security agreements;</p>
<p>(4) Contractor facilities where upon the written request of the Contractor, the Department of Labor Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Programs has waived the posting requirements with respect to any of the Contractor's facilities if the Deputy Assistant Secretary finds that the Contractor has demonstrated that--</p>
<p>(i) The facility is in all respects separate and distinct from activities of the Contractor related to the performance of a contract; and</p>
<p>(ii) Such a waiver will not interfere with or impede the effectuation of the Executive order; or</p>
<p>(5) Work outside the United States that does not involve the recruitment or employment of workers within the United States.</p>
<p>(f) The Department of Labor publishes the official employee notice in two variations; one for Contractors covered by the Railway Labor Act and a second for all other Contractors. The Contractor shall--</p>
<p>(1) Obtain the required employee notice poster from the Division of Interpretations and Standards, Office of Labor-Management Standards, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N-5605, Washington, DC 20210, or from any field office of the Department's Office of Labor-Management Standards or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs;</p>
<p>(2) Download a copy of the poster from the Office of Labor-Management Standards website at http://www.olms.dol.gov; or</p>
<p>(3) Reproduce and use exact duplicate copies of the Department of Labor's official poster.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, entered into in connection with this contract, unless exempted by the Department of Labor Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Programs on account of special circumstances in the national interest under authority of 29 CFR 470.3(c). For indefinite quantity subcontracts, the Contractor shall include the substance of this clause if the value of orders in any calendar year of the subcontract is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Pursuant to 29 CFR Part 470, Subpart B--Compliance Evaluations, Complaint Investigations and Enforcement Procedures, the Secretary of Labor may direct the Contractor to take such action in the enforcement of these regulations, including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance with respect to any such subcontract or purchase order. If the Contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor or vendor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the Contractor may request the United States, through the Secretary of Labor, to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.</p>

<p>This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The Offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the Offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the Offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es):<br />http://www.arnet.gov/far/<br />Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clauses:<br />52.215-16 FACILITIES CAPITAL COST OF MONEY (JUN 2003)</p>
<p>52.222-24 PREAWARD ON-SITE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY COMPLIANCE EVALUATION (FEB 1999)<br />52.222-46 EVALUATION OF COMPENSATION FOR PROEFSSIONAL EMPLOYEES (FEB 1993)<br />52.237-10 IDENTIFICATION OF UNCOMPENSATED OVERTIME (OCT 1997)<br />52.252-3 ALTERATIONS IN SOLICITATION (APR 1984)</p>
<p>L.3 SOLICITATION PROVISION</p>
<p>As indicated in the general rules in 9.505, significant potential organizational conflicts of interest are normally resolved by imposing some restraint, appropriate to the nature of the conflict, upon the contractor's eligibility for future contracts or subcontracts. Therefore, affected solicitations shall contain a provision that- <br />(a) Invites offerors' attention to this subpart; <br />(b) States the nature of the potential conflict as seen by the Contracting Officer; <br />(c) States the nature of the proposed restraint upon future contractor activities; and <br />(d) Depending on the nature of the acquisition, states whether or not the terms of any proposed clause and the application of this subpart to the contract are subject to negotiation. <br /><br />(A) Due to the overriding need for contractor independence and to avoid significant potential organization conflicts of interest (as defined in FAR 9.501) and/or the appearance of impartiality and/or unfair competitive advantage the awardee and their subcontractor's may be precluded from the future award of CMS related contracts and/or subcontracting or consulting for a CMS supplier.</p>
<p>(B) Since the contractor's independence is vital to the usefulness and value of its services and the contractor's findings and recommendations may affect future CMS contracting, CMS foresees very few circumstances under which the contractor could perform other CMS contracts, or commercial work related to support the activities, processes, and tools required for the operations of the Workers Compensation Review program or subcontracts without presenting a potential organizational partiality and/or unfair competitive advantage. In accordance with the FAR, the CMS Contracting Officer will make a case-by-case determination of the existence of organizational conflicts of interest. If a potential organizational conflict of interest is identified, the Contracting Officer will determine if the conflict can be sufficiently mitigated. Prior to proposal, offerors should examine relevant Federal laws and regulations on organizational conflict of interest, including but not limited to FAR 9.501 - 9.508. If awarded this contract, the Contractor must disclose its contract status in all future bids and/or proposals made to CMS for a period of one year after the conclusion of this contract. The impact of the FAR 9.501 - 9.508 and/or the terms of this clause are subject to negotiation.</p>
<p>(C) The successful offeror must have complete independence in this effort (unless specifically exempted by the CMS Contracting Officer). Contractors desiring to provide services to CMS under this procurement shall be ineligible to participate in any contracts, subcontracts, or proposals (solicited and unsolicited) which stem directly from the Contractor's performance of work under this contract for a period of one (1) year after the completion of this contract. CMS does not intend to suspend, terminate, or otherwise end current contract(s) with the successful offeror due to award of this contract. However, proposals on this effort submitted by offeror(s) who currently have a contract with CMS which contains either option years, or the potential for additional period(s) of performance, will be reviewed to determine whether the offeror can be awarded this contract and maintain complete independence. However as the clause in H.5 indicates the Contractor is not precluded from competing for follow-on contracts or subcontracts for advisory and assistance services</p>
<p>(D) Contractors must disclose all potential and actual conflicts of interest. Contractors shall submit a plan to mitigate all potential and actual conflicts described in its proposal with the information required at Section H.5 of the WCRC contract or a certification that all work to be performed under this contract is free of conflicts of interest. Note: The contractor is also responsible for determining if an organizational conflict of interest exists with subcontractors and in subcontracts and for ensuring that the subcontractor has mitigated any conflict or potential conflict prior to the award of any subcontract for furnishing supplies or services under the prime contract.</p>
<p>(E) The following paragraphs illustrate situations in which questions concerning conflicts of interest may arise. These situations are not all inclusive, but are intended to help contractors identify their own organizational conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>1. During the performance of this requirement, it is anticipated that the contractor will have access to proprietary information. When a contractor requires proprietary information from others to perform a Government contract and can leverage the contract to obtain it, the contractor may gain an unfair competitive advantage unless restrictions are imposed. Therefore, if two or more primes are teaming with the same subcontractor, there would be an actual conflict. In this case, the subcontractor would not be able to mitigate its prior knowledge of the proposals to the other primes without complete recusal of the subsequent teaming arrangements). However, this would not preclude an otherwise successful prime from subcontracting with the same subcontractor after the solicitation phase and award of the contract.</p>
<p>2. WCRC Support may also involve the review of the cases, products, or services of other firms who had been commercial competitors. A WCRC contract shall not be awarded to a contractor that will evaluate its own offers for products or services, or those of a competitor, without proper safeguards to ensure objectivity to protect the Government's interests.</p>
<p>3. If the offeror has been substantially involved in, and continues the representing of beneficiaries and claimants within any Workers Compensation state system and then competes for any of the CMS system(s) or its components, the offeror would potentially be biased in evaluating and testing those prior cases.</p>
<p>(F) CMS will not award a contract to an offeror who has an unresolved conflict of interest.</p>

<p>(ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and --<br />(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or<br />(2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or<br />(3) It is the only proposal received.</p>
<p>ii(B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

<p>(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this Offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract.

If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>
<p>(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the Offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.</p>
<p>(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest(s) to do so. The Government reserves the right to change the type of contract to be awarded, if it is determined in the Government's best interest(s) to do so.</p>
<p>(7) Exchanges with Offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.</p>
<p>(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.</p>
<p>(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.</p>
<p>(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting Offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:<br />(i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed Offeror's offer.<br />(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed Offeror and past performance information on the debriefed Offeror.<br />(iii) The overall ranking of all Offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.<br />(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.<br />(v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful Offeror.<br />(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency</p>
<p>L.6 FAR 52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984)</p>
<p>The Government contemplates award of a cost plus fixed fee contract. For purposes of evaluation, Offerors shall submit proposals based upon a cost plus fixed fee type contract. However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award any contract type/pricing arrangement. <br />Offerors should note that the Government reserves the right to expand and/or modify any resultant contract and it's SOW in order to ensure continued services and to promote efficiency within the Medicare program.</p>

<p>Conflict of Interest<br />In order to be eligible for award of the WCRC contract, the Government must ensure that an Offeror is free, to the greatest extent possible, of all conflicts of interest. The WCRC will be acting on behalf of the Government determining in-part, its financial responsibilities to third parties working within the Workers' Compensation Community. Therefore, the Offeror is required to submit the disclosure of information contained in contract section H.5 Conflict of Interest, in order to be considered for award, and Section K. Failure to submit the required information may deem an Offeror's proposal to be non-responsive to the solicitation.<br />Examples of methods an Offeror may use to mitigate conflicts of interest, including those created as a result of the financial relationships of individuals within the organization are provided below. The examples are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the possible methods to mitigate conflicts of interest, further the Contracting Officer is not obligated to approve a mitigation method that uses one or more of these examples. An Offeror's method of mitigating conflicts of interest will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis during the proposal evaluation process.<br />Divestiture of, or reduction in the amount of, the financial relationship the organization has in another organization to a level acceptable to CMS and appropriate for the situation;<br />If shared responsibilities create the conflict, a plan, included in the Conflicts of Interest Certificate and approved by CMS, to separate lines of business and management or critical staff from work on the WCRC contract;<br />If the conflict exists because of the financial relationships of individuals within the organization, divestiture of the relationships by the individual involved;<br />If the conflict exists because of an individual's indirect interest, divestiture of the interest to levels acceptable to CMS or removal of the individual from the work under the contract.</p>
<p>Compliance Awareness<br />In order to be eligible for award of a contract, the Offeror must have in place an Organizational Conflict of Interest compliance awareness that is acceptable to CMS.

<p>L.20 ORAL PRESENTATION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>The CMS will schedule oral presentations with those Offerors, who submit a proposal, which is determined to be responsive to the requirements of the solicitation. The oral presentation, alone, will be the basis for CMS determination of offeror technical qualifications. Offerors should not assume or expect CMS to dig/find pertinent information from the written proposal. Therefore, the oral presentation is critical to offeror success.<br />Oral presentations will be scheduled in various different CMS buildings and rooms, as space and time permits. It is the intention of CMS to audio/video record the presentations and Q&amp;A. Each Offeror will present its oral presentation to the same CMS audience consisting of the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) and responsible acquisition officials. The presentation should be with PowerPoint (or similar) slides for TEP review. Offerors must bring their own projector(s) and power cord(s). Offeror's should also bring at least 10 printed (hard copies) of their presentation overhead slides. <br />The following oral presentation organization/instructions are provided as guidance to the Offerors.

Purpose<br />The purpose of conducting oral presentations is to enable the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) to assess each Offeror's understanding of and approach to the SOW requirements. The TEP will concentrate on the oral presentation, Offerors are not to assume that the TEP will resource answers out of the written tech proposal submittal. <br />The presentation should also emphasize unique, relevant capabilities that the Offeror brings to this project and any other advantages that the Offeror may provide.</p>
<p>2. Time Allowed for Presentation<br />The Offeror shall be allotted two hours to complete the oral technical proposal presentation, which includes a thorough response to each area of interest to CMS. One 10 minute break will be scheduled to occur at the Offeror's discretion. Following presentation conclusion, there will be a 15 minute break, and then there will be one hour allowed for Q&amp;A from the TEP. The Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist will tell the Offeror when to start its presentation, keep time, and stop the presentation at the end of two hours, whether or not the Offeror has finished.</p>
<p>3. Participation and Attendance<br />Only members of the Offeror's or the subcontractor's in-house staff may participate in the oral presentation.

Any delay for which the Offeror is responsible will not be restored to the Offeror's available presentation time.</p>
<p>Presentation Materials: The Offeror shall provide a copy of the presentation on one CD in PowerPoint 2003 or 2007 format. The Offeror shall provide all other equipment necessary for the presentation. The only written information that may be submitted during the oral presentation is copies of PowerPoint slides or other form of presentation handout.

However, the production and use of an excessive number of slides may be detrimental to an Offeror's interest. When reviewing and evaluating the oral presentations, the Government will not review or evaluate any slide that was not projected and addressed during the oral presentation.</p>
<p>5. Question and Answer Session<br />The purpose of the Q&amp;A will be for the TEP to ask any clarification questions of the offeror. This Q&amp;A will not be discussions, within the FAR meaning of the word, but will afford the offeror the courtesy of being fully understood in what they have said, by allowing the TEP to ask for repetition or clarification on stated points from the oral presentation (ONLY).</p>
<p>L.21 52.215-20 REQUIREMENTS FOR COST OR PRICING DATA OR INFORMATION OTHER THAN COST OR PRICING DATA (OCT 1997) - ALT IV (OCT 1997)<br />a. Exceptions from cost or pricing data.</p>
<p>(1) In lieu of submitting cost or pricing data, Offerors may submit a written request for exception by submitting the information described in the following paragraphs. The Contracting Officer may require additional supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine whether an exception should be granted, and whether the price is fair and reasonable.</p>

<p>-End of Section L-</p>
<p>M.1 GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR AWARD OF CONTRACTS</p>
<p>a. General: This procurement is for the award of a single Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract .<br />All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. Award will be made to the Offeror(s) whose proposal contains the combination of criteria offering the best overall value to the Government. In making this determination, the Government will combine the Offeror's scores for the Oral Presentation, with consideration of the cost and pricing data. Cost and Pricing data are required for, and will be looked at, for the Transitions period, Base, and all four Option Periods of Performance. Cost and Price will be evaluated as a composite whole, over the entire life of the contract. Transitions/ramp-up will not be examined as part of steady-state operations cost. A trade-off technique will be used that allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced/cost Offeror or other than the highest technically rated Offeror. It permits tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost/price evaluation factors. In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical/management features and achieving successful production of WCMSA's than with making an award at the lowest overall cost to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical or management features.</p>
<p>b.Technical Evaluation: The Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) will evaluate and score each oral presentation, by applying the weighted technical criteria and sub-criteria set forth in Section M.1 below. The evaluation will produce numerical scores (points) for each Offeror based upon the information contained in the Oral Presentation alone. Therefore, the Oral Presentation shall provide all information necessary to properly evaluate the proposals in accordance with the evaluation criteria. In addition to determining a numerical score (points) for each Offeror, the TEP will 1) recommend whether or not a proposal is technically acceptable or technically unacceptable; and 2) identify its strengths, weaknesses and deficiencies.</p>
<p>c. Business Evaluation: The business proposal will be analyzed and evaluated by the Government to determine the reasonableness and the realism of the proposed cost/price. The purpose of this cost realism analysis will be to determine if the Offeror's proposed costs reflect the Offeror's understanding of the Government's requirements and if the proposed costs are consistent with the various elements of the Offeror's technical proposal. In addition all other areas of the Business Proposal will be evaluated for their value and contribution to success, and whether they either contribute to, or mitigate risk to, the Government</p>
<p>d. Past Performance: The Offeror will be evaluated on the performance of work on contracts completed or currently in progress, within the last 5 years for both award of the IDIQ contract and the task orders. In accordance with FAR 9.104-1, General standards, the Offeror must have a satisfactory performance record in order to be considered for award. See also FAR 9.104-3(b), Satisfactory Performance Record, and FAR 42.15, Contractor Performance Information.</p>
<p>e. Clarification/Communications with Offerors Before Establishment of the Competitive Range: In accordance with FAR 15.306, Exchanges with Offerors After Receipt of Proposals, the Government may be required to conduct clarifications and/or communications with the Offeror prior to the establishment of the Competitive Range. These clarifications/communications are in addition to the Oral Presentation question and answer session identified above. Discussions, as defined in FAR 15.306(d) may be conducted after establishment of the Competitive Range.</p>
<p>An Offeror should not assume that the Contracting Officer will independently obtain information necessary to evaluate its proposal and should therefore supply all information required to evaluate its proposal. Failure to provide the information required in order to evaluate a proposal could result in a less satisfactory TEP evaluation or rejection of the proposal as being technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>f. Competitive Range: Based on the evaluations of each Offeror against all evaluation criteria <br />and other requirements of the solicitation, the Contracting Officer shall establish a <br />Competitive Range for the contract comprised of all of the most highly evaluated proposals, <br />unless the range is reduced for purposes of efficiency or unless award is made without <br />discussions.</p>
<p>Further, if the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the Competitive Range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the Competitive Range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>
<p>Offerors will be notified by email/letter whether or not it has been included in the Competitive Range. Offerors not in the Competitive Range will be eliminated from further consideration for award. Offerors excluded or otherwise eliminated from the Competitive Range may request a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505, Pre-award Debriefing of Offerors.<br /><br />h. Discussions: After announcement of the Competitive Range and upon completion of discussions (if required) in accordance with FAR 15.3, a request for final revised proposals may be issued to all Offerors still within the Competitive Range. If, after discussions have begun, an Offeror originally in the Competitive Range is no longer considered to be among the most highly rated Offerors being considered for award, that Offeror may be eliminated from the Competitive Range whether or not all material aspects of the proposal have been discussed, or whether or not the Offeror has been afforded an opportunity to submit a proposal revision.</p>
<p>After receipt and evaluation of a final revised proposal, if requested, an Offeror may be selected for award and may be involved in final negotiations. The content of such negotiations would not have any bearing on the selection process and would be in accordance with HHSAR 315-370, "Finalization of details with the selected source."</p>
<p>However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to make award of a contract(s) without regard to "discussions." If the Government awards without discussions, a competitive range will not be established. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Offeror to submit the most advantageous proposal to the Government with the initial submission.</p>
<p>You are reminded that inclusion in the Competitive Range is not a guarantee for award of a contract. Offeror's eliminated from the Competitive Range will be notified in accordance with FAR 15.503, Notice to Unsuccessful Offerors.</p>
<p>i. Source Selection: Source selection will be made in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and The Department of Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulations (HHSAR) and this solicitation. Award of the single contract under this solicitation shall be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to provide the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>j. Amendment or Cancellation of Solicitation: CMS reserves the right to amend or cancel this solicitation as necessary to meet CMS requirements.</p>
<p>M.2 TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />The following evaluation criteria, with the relative weights assigned to each criterion as <br />indicated, will be applied to the technical evaluation of each oral presentation only. Supplemental materials included as part of the written proposal (resumes, examples of work breakdown structure (WBS)/ business project plan, and organizational charts for prime and subcontractors) will be reviewed but not scored. Please note that "Subcontracting Approach" is a "Pass/Fail" rating. If you are utilizing subcontractors for this effort, you must receive a "Pass" in the subcontractor evaluation to be considered for contract award. <br /><br />Workers' Compensation Review Contract <br />The maximum number of points that may be earned for the Offeror's technical proposal is 1200 points.</p>

<p>The work of the AFSS Team is guided by a Framework Document, first drafted in 2005, that identifies the current processes, guidance, regulations and policy documents that address feed safety and the documents that should be developed to make the Agency's feed safety program comprehensive and risk-based. The Framework Document has been revised three times and will undergo additional revisions as needed.</p>
<p>One of the gaps identified in the AFSS Framework Document is the need for a more comprehensive animal feed safety program in the United States. To address that gap, the AFSS Team has written process control regulations that cover receipt, manufacture and distribution of all animal feed, including pet food and feed ingredients. These proposed regulations are presently in Agency clearance.<br /><br />Critical to each step in the process is the identification of potential feed hazards and the implementation of steps to ensure that the hazards are controlled so they do not present an unacceptable risk to animal or human health. The FDA plans to release guidance on feed hazard identification and control to assist manufacturers and transporters of animal feed to comply with this requirement and thereby ensure the safety of their feed products. One challenge in drafting the proposed rule is defining terms in a way that takes into account the fact that the presence of certain feed hazards in animal feed or the existence of certain conditions offered does not always pose a significant risk to animal or human health.</p>
<p>Duties</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide expert services to the Center for Veterinary Medicine <br />(CVM) for development of guidance for industry which explain how to identify feed <br />Hazards of concern and steps to control the presence offered hazards in feed products so <br />animal or human health is not compromised. Specifically, the Contractor will be responsible for the timely drafting of guidance documents and efficient revision of the <br />documents based on comments from the AFSS Team.</p>
<p>The Contractor should have extensive experience and knowledge regarding the presence offered hazards in animal feed and the measures the feed industry has at its disposal for handling such hazards. The Contractor needs to understand the principles of risk and relative risk assessment. Also, the Contractor needs wide-ranging knowledge of the regulatory and stakeholder groups that could be impacted by the guidance. Furthermore, the Contractor must have a working knowledge of the feed industry as it currently exists</p>
<p>and operates, as well as the goals, objectives and premises of the AFSS. The Contractor will need to be available to travel on occasion.</p>
<p>Location<br /><br />The work will take place at the contractor's place of business and on occasion at CVM, 7519 Standish Place, Rockville, MD. <br />Equipment - Use No government funded nor extraordinary equipment is needed.</p>

<CONTACT>Roy E. Mutch, Contract Specialist, Phone 404-253-1258, Email roy.mutch@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order for a Support Plan for the TSQ Quantum Ultra System - MSPEC-LC-MS. The requirements will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 13.5. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the solicitation: Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is FDA-10-223-SOL-00092. This solicitation is issued as Request for Quote (RFQ). The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334516. Contract Type: Commercial Item-Firm Fixed Price. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered. The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting the following services: Support Plan - MSPEC - LC - MS.

Statement of Work : 
Provide a one-year plus 4 Option Years comprehensive maintenance and service Support Plan for the TSQ Quantum Ultra System.  This instrumentation, its maintenance and uninterrupted operation and the collaborative interactions with vendors scientific and technical support personnel, application scientists and factory personnel is required and is a critical need for the regulation of food and drug products and agencys food defense initiatives.  The vendor must be able to demonstrate broad and comprehensive experience providing equivalent support for the system listed above as evidenced through references with point of contact information listed.
Each maintenance/service is to include an unlimited number of on-demand, on-site service visits within a maximum of 72-hour response time.  The short response time is of critical value to the field labs to prevent building a back-log of information-critical public health sample for analysis.  Most of the instruments in the labs operate around the clock to process samples that require a fast turn-around time due to numerous factors:  perishable import samples which need to be tested immediately so as to make a statutory regulatory decision on the admissibility of the product before it deteriorates at the port, consumer-complaint samples for which issues need to be resolved as soon as possible, and any analysis related to identifying public health outbreaks or analyses in support of product traceback are also high-priorities.  Due to the sensitive nature of the analyses the ORA field labs have to perform on a daily basis and instrument reliability and operational status is of utmost importance.  Instrument reliability can be achieved by appropriate service coverage administered by a professional company that can deliver comprehensive services and support in a fast, effective manner.

The service also requires support for technical inquiries within 2 hours.  This is another very important feature the labs routinely require.  For example, many minor software or hardware problems may have simple solutions that can be addressed with technical phone support, thus further reducing instrument down-time.  Also, whenever the ORA field labs are faced with a new challenge, a new analyte to screen for, they have to rapidly develop and implement new methods.  Availability of diverse scientific advice from the vendors technical support staff when trying to run new methods on the instruments is a required resource in this procurement as it directly assists in the speedy implementation of new LC-MS methods to respond to new challenges.  Most importantly, the service must afford access not only to application scientists and engineers, but also to the personnel at the factory with the engineers that designed and built the instrument.  This is a valuable resource for complex repairs and problems.

The service must also include at least one preventative maintenance visit per contract calendar year  maintenance visits prolong the life of the instruments, systematically replace consumable parts, and identify and resolve minor problems before they turn into big issues.  Having the routine maintenance performed by the professionals most familiar with the instruments frees up time of FDA lab personnel.  These visits also ensure that laboratories are in compliance with quality management system requirements. 

The service requires factory-certified replacement parts and software updates and notifications.  The contract must include a subscription to electronic support or Online Technical Resources which include notes developed by the vendor engineers and scientists and is a key advantage to having a vendor service contract in that FDA analysts have easy access to the authors of these notes.

This service will ensure reliable operation of the field instruments which in turn supports the mission-critical analytical work the ORA labs perform on an everyday basis to promote food safety and defense as well as to protect the Public Health.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is soliciting proposals under solicitation number RECOVERY ARRAOS:10-223-SOL-00105 "Legacy Data Conversion" for an initiative called Legacy Data Conversion Services. Certain legacy study data that currently resides at FDA in a myriad of different formats must be converted into an electronic uniform
standard structure to facilitate answering important scientific and regulatory questions of interest to promote the public health. The requirement will provide services to convert legacy study data to a standard format identified by FDA {format to be identified on a case by case basis and may include Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC; www.CDISC.org) Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM), Standard for Exchange of
Nonclinical Data (SEND), Analysis Dataset Model (ADaM), and the CDISC-HL7 (Health Level 7; www.HL7.org) standards}. The contractor shall work with FDA to harmonize variable names and terminology as needed to allow analysis across multiple studies. The requirement will also support the advancement of current standards and support the development of new standardized values for domain data by ensuring alignment to the appropriate standard development organization (SDO; e.g. CDISC, HL7).

The requirement entails the Contractor be able to provide the project management, expertise, and labor leading to the successful conversion of the legacy data to its standardized format. The requirement has been set aside for small business and will be open competitively to all small business firms who wish to compete.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-41.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333994 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business. In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the manufacturer and distributor of these supplies must be a small business in accordance with the NAICS code identified.</p>
<p>For size purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end item being acquired. The manufacturer is the concern which, with its own facilities, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or organic substances, including the assembly of parts and components, into the end item being acquired.</p>
<p>The end item must possess characteristics which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not possess before the original substances, parts or components were assembled or transformed. The end item may be finished and ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semi finished as a raw material to be used in further manufacturing. Firms which perform only minimal operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a furnace system for processing non-corrosive non-volatile solid samples at controlled temperatures up to 2100 degrees Celsius in Argon gas from 200 Torr to 1000 Torr and in rough vacuum. All equipment must be new. Refurbished and or remanufactured shall not be considered for award.</p>
<p><br />DEFINITIONS:</p>
<p>Hot Zone: Region located inside the furnace chamber which contains the heating elements and the open region interior to the heating elements (the hearth) where samples are heated to a selected temperature (the Temperature Set Point).</p>
<p>Temperature Set Point: A user-determined setting stored in the memory of the electronic temperature control unit as the reference temperature for automatic control of the hot zone temperature. In normal operation, this is the hot zone temperature reached by applying power to the heating elements, and then maintained when the system is using feedback to control the power provided to the heating elements.</p>
<p>Safe Rate: A rate of heating or cooling that the furnace system is designed to provide with no damage or deterioration occurring in any of the system components.</p>
<p>Overshoot: The condition that occurs when the rate of heating is poorly controlled, such that the actual temperature of the hot zone exceeds the Temperature Set Point. The Temperature Set Point should be reached under conditions of critical damping, in which the temperature control unit anticipates the amount of power that is required to monotonically approach the desired temperature with minimum settling time and no measureable overshoot in temperature.</p>
<p>Communication Bus: The digital electronic interface that provides data from the system control units to a central, user-supplied computer, and that allows the computer to communicate settings and commands to the system controllers.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>In response to the 7.0 earthquake on January 12, 2010 that devastated the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, OFDA deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team to lead the U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian response. Haiti has long been the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with social and economic indicators among the worst in the world. Continuing political instability, civil unrest, environmental degradation, and lack of capacity within the national government create a context where even moderate-sized natural hazards have significant negative impact on the Haitian populace. In fiscal years 2008 and 2009, over $15 million was provided in response to natural disasters in Haiti.<br /><br />At present, OFDA has provided over $100 million in humanitarian awards supporting programs in shelter, health, nutrition, humanitarian coordination and information management, risk reduction, water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions, non-food items, and logistical support and continues to identify programming possibilities based upon ongoing needs assessments on the ground.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met in the ongoing response and rehabilitation post-earthquake.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, as determined in consultation with the Embassy and the Mission and subject to security and programmatic considerations. It also requires willingness to travel outside of Port-au-Prince on short notice for possibly an extended period of time. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Haiti, as well as for other disaster risk reduction and training programs. The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Haiti Mission, the US Embassy, the Department of Defense (DOD) and other U.S. Agencies as appropriate, international organizations (IOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the United Nations (UN), to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be primarily responsible for interagency coordination as well as program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Office in San Jose, Costa Rica, OFDA Washington, and USAID Haiti and U.S. Embassy/Haiti, as required. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.</p>
<p>Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the OFDA Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for Latin America and the Caribbean and in consultation with USAID/Haiti, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Haiti on the coordination of humanitarian issues related to program issues among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy, DOD and other U.S Agencies, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.<br />&bull; Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with the OFDA/LAC PRA and OFDA/Washington, as necessary. <br />&bull; Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDA-funded programs in Haiti. <br />&bull; Serve as the point of contact on any future OFDA response activity in Haiti. <br />&bull; Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance efforts in Haiti. Regularly review partner's reports, coordinate with OFDA/LAC on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated field feedback to the partners.<br />&bull; Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:<br />o Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.<br />o Capacity and level of activity of indigenous institutions to carry out relief programs;<br />o Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;<br />o Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;<br />o Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;<br />o Impact of GOH activities on humanitarian programs; <br />o Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA.<br />&bull; Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDA's Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/Washington and OFDA/LAC.<br />&bull; Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDA's approach to humanitarian protection. Work closely with the PRA to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.<br />&bull; Visit OFDA-funded projects, and report on a timely basis to OFDA/Washington and OFDA/LAC on the quality of grantees' work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions. <br />&bull; Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.<br />&bull; Maintain regular liaison with UN, NGOs, IOs, the GOH, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.<br />&bull; Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.<br />&bull; Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including monthly official reporting cables or as the situation warrants.<br />&bull; Oversee the workload of Haiti Program Office supporting OFDA's program in Haiti.<br />&bull; Have the ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.</p>
<p><br />SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA PRA for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Haiti, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. Embassy staff. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from the OFDA/LAC PRA and OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The OFDA PRA for LAC will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>
<p>12. START DATE: Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.</p>
<p>13. POINT OF CONTACT: See Cover Letter.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order for a Support Plan for the TSQ Quantum Ultra System - MSPEC-LC-MS. The requirements will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 13.5. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the solicitation: Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is FDA-10-223-SOL-00092. This solicitation is issued as Request for Quote (RFQ). The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334516. Contract Type: Commercial Item-Firm Fixed Price. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered. The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting the following services: Support Plan - MSPEC - LC - MS.

Statement of Work : 
Provide a one-year plus 4 Option Years comprehensive maintenance and service Support Plan for the TSQ Quantum Ultra System.  This instrumentation, its maintenance and uninterrupted operation and the collaborative interactions with vendors scientific and technical support personnel, application scientists and factory personnel is required and is a critical need for the regulation of food and drug products and agencys food defense initiatives.  The vendor must be able to demonstrate broad and comprehensive experience providing equivalent support for the system listed above as evidenced through references with point of contact information listed.
Each maintenance/service is to include an unlimited number of on-demand, on-site service visits within a maximum of 72-hour response time.  The short response time is of critical value to the field labs to prevent building a back-log of information-critical public health sample for analysis.  Most of the instruments in the labs operate around the clock to process samples that require a fast turn-around time due to numerous factors:  perishable import samples which need to be tested immediately so as to make a statutory regulatory decision on the admissibility of the product before it deteriorates at the port, consumer-complaint samples for which issues need to be resolved as soon as possible, and any analysis related to identifying public health outbreaks or analyses in support of product traceback are also high-priorities.  Due to the sensitive nature of the analyses the ORA field labs have to perform on a daily basis and instrument reliability and operational status is of utmost importance.  Instrument reliability can be achieved by appropriate service coverage administered by a professional company that can deliver comprehensive services and support in a fast, effective manner.

The service also requires support for technical inquiries within 2 hours.  This is another very important feature the labs routinely require.  For example, many minor software or hardware problems may have simple solutions that can be addressed with technical phone support, thus further reducing instrument down-time.  Also, whenever the ORA field labs are faced with a new challenge, a new analyte to screen for, they have to rapidly develop and implement new methods.  Availability of diverse scientific advice from the vendors technical support staff when trying to run new methods on the instruments is a required resource in this procurement as it directly assists in the speedy implementation of new LC-MS methods to respond to new challenges.  Most importantly, the service must afford access not only to application scientists and engineers, but also to the personnel at the factory with the engineers that designed and built the instrument.  This is a valuable resource for complex repairs and problems.

The service must also include at least one preventative maintenance visit per contract calendar year  maintenance visits prolong the life of the instruments, systematically replace consumable parts, and identify and resolve minor problems before they turn into big issues.  Having the routine maintenance performed by the professionals most familiar with the instruments frees up time of FDA lab personnel.  These visits also ensure that laboratories are in compliance with quality management system requirements. 

The service requires factory-certified replacement parts and software updates and notifications.  The contract must include a subscription to electronic support or Online Technical Resources which include notes developed by the vendor engineers and scientists and is a key advantage to having a vendor service contract in that FDA analysts have easy access to the authors of these notes.

This service will ensure reliable operation of the field instruments which in turn supports the mission-critical analytical work the ORA labs perform on an everyday basis to promote food safety and defense as well as to protect the Public Health.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR ELECTRONFLOOD GUNS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This noticeserves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will notbe issued.The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions that were asked about therequirement.Question:Line Item 1:Our understanding of the Beam Coverage and Uniformity Requirements for Line Item 1: There must be a 20 inch diameter coverage area at a 60 inch working distance with lessthan 15% difference across the majority of this area. If there is overshooting of the required 20 inch diameter area, this outlying coveragemust be less than 20% different across the entire region. Is this correct?  Must the coverage area be circular?  Can there be overshooting of the beam with the uniformity requirements still met?The 20 inch diameter area would be reached with beam washing [beam wobbling].Answer:  Yes, there should be &lt; 15% difference in uniformity across a 20 degree cone(which works out to the 20 diameter).	 Outside of that area the uniformity should bewithin 20% (actually the spec reads 20% within a 30 degree cone).  So 15% within the 20inches and no more than 20% within approximately 32. Circular coverage?  Does not have to be circular coverage but must cover a 20 circle at60 working distance.As long as the uniformity requirement is met, overshooting is permissible.Question:  Line Item 2:Just to double check, is the Beam Coverage Uniformity (Homogeneity) requirement &gt;50%?Answer:   Item 2Yes, the uniformity must be greater than 50% across the coverage area.	The due date for receipt of offers is  extended to June 2, 2010.Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on May 19, 2010.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) No. 1<br />GEITA11
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is ISSUED for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit an offer if, or when, a solicitation is released. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does NOT constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this RFI. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Formal notices will be on http://www.fbo.gov/ website.</p>
<p><br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland AFB, TX is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for the follow-on to its Global Engineering, Integration &amp; Technical Assistance (GEITA) contracts. The new procurement, GEITA11, is for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) at various locations worldwide (CONUS and OCONUS) primarily on U.S. Air Force installations. AFCEE anticipates awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) basic contracts under NAICS Code 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services). The size standard associated with this NAICS code is $7 million. AFCEE currently anticipates awards to be made using full and open competition and partial Small Business set-asides. All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase. Individual Task Orders (TO) will be awarded utilizing the terms and conditions of the basic contracts. AFCEE is considering the inclusion of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) or Cost-Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements in each basic contract. Additionally, AFCEE currently anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five years with one additional year for completion of performance. Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov). The program ceiling for this procurement is estimated to be $625 million.</p>
<p>AFCEE requests comments from interested parties to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. The current GEITA05 contracts have cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) and firm-fixed-price (FFP) pricing arrangements. The government anticipates using these pricing arrangements for GEITA11. <br />a. What are industry comments and concerns with continuing these pricing strategies?<br />b. What are industry comments and concerns if Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) and/or Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) pricing arrangements were used on GEITA11 in lieu of CPFF?<br />2. The government is considering incorporating fully burdened FFP labor rates in the GEITA11 basic contracts. This would be similar to other AFCEE contracts. Request industry comments on using this strategy considering the global scope of AFCEE requirements.<br />3. The source selection approach for GEITA11 is in the process of being established.<br />a. What are industry comments on the pros and cons of using Price Performance Tradeoff (PPT) source selection procedures for this effort?<br />b. What are industry comments on the pros and cons of using Full Trade-Off (FTO) source selection procedures for this effort?<br />4. The draft GEITA11 Performance Work Statement (PWS) dated 18 May 2010 is attached. Please discuss your company's past experience in providing these types of services. <br />5. The government is considering adding more detail to the metrics for the Services Summary (SS) in the GEITA11 contracts (see paragraph 3.0 of the attached draft GEITA11 PWS). <br />a. How could we improve the SS for GEITA11?<br />b. If you have other A&amp;AS contracts, what metrics do they use? <br />6. The government requires information concerning resources required for performing A&amp;AS services under the GEITA11 program to enhance planning and future strategies. The government will add data reporting requirements (Management Deliverables) to the GEITA11 contracts for hours and types of labor utilized and period of time to complete tasks and/or produce deliverables. <br />a. Please provide input concerning existing or recommended methods of receiving this data from contractors in a format compatible with Microsoft Office products (e.g. in Excel Spreadsheet or Access Database format). Examples or templates currently used by industry in collecting, managing and analyzing these data elements would be appreciated. <br />b. Please specify how you ensure data is complete, timely and thorough. <br />c. Please discuss the pros and cons of collecting this data on a contract-wide basis VS task-order basis.<br />d. Please discuss the ideal reporting cycle - i.e. 30 days or other recurring cycle.<br />e. Please address the cost impacts of delivering this data at the task order level.<br />7. What is the historical maximum work load your firm has managed while assuring effective program/project implementation and maintaining quality products?<br />8. What is the historical range of dispersion of work you have performed simultaneously throughout the world?<br />a. Where has your firm performed in CONUS as well as OCONUS locations in the past?<br />b. Please tell us how you would manage and perform the full scope of requirements presented in the draft GEITA11 PWS in both CONUS and OCONUS locations.<br />9. In terms of evaluating a company that submits a proposal for GEITA11, what critical evaluation criteria would differentiate companies' capabilities? Explain your rationale in detail. <br />10. Attached is the current GEITA05 Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause 5352.209-9002 for your reference. <br />a. Please comment on any concerns you may have. <br />b. What should the government be considering?<br />11. When you respond to this RFI, inform the government whether you are a large or small business under the NAICS Code 541620. Sub-categories include 8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman owned small business, veteran owned small business, HUB zone small business, service disabled veteran small business, and HBCU/MI. If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories?<br />12. For small business consideration:<br />a. Would your firm be able to compete under NAICS 541620? <br />b. If not, why? <br />c. Please provide your recommendations concerning the anticipated number of contract awards, how many contracts should be reserved for small business, and the proposed NAICS.<br />13. If you are a small business, would you consider submitting a proposal as a prime contractor?<br />14. Would you participate in the acquisition with other firms as teaming members or joint ventures? What other teaming opportunities do you see for this acquisition?<br />15. The proposed subcontracting goals for GEITA05 were: Small business - 23%; Small disadvantaged business - 5%; Woman owned small business- 5%; HUB zone - 3%; Veteran owned small business- 3%; Service disabled veteran owned small business- 3%. All of these percentages were based on the prime's anticipated subcontracted dollars. AFCEE has moved towards the Small Business goal being based on actual obligated dollars and the sub-categories being based on anticipated subcontracted dollars. <br />a. What are the pros and cons of doing this scenario with GEITA11? <br />b. What are your actual percentages and subcontracted dollars to small businesses, to include all sub-categories, for this type of work?<br />16. Is your company able and willing to perform efforts worldwide?<br />a. If not, please explain.<br />17. In your view, is the proposed NAICS code (541620) the most appropriate code for this work?<br />a. If not, please provide your rational why not.<br />18. What are industry comments on the pros and cons of using one (1) Request for Proposal (RFP) with full and open competition and partial small business set-aside competitions verses utilizing multiple RFPs for each competition level?<br />19. What are industry comments if you were putting together a RFP for an effort of this magnitude<br />a. What would you expect to see from the offerors in terms of experience?<br />b. What would you expect to see from the offerors in terms of performance?<br />c. What page limitations would you place on proposals received?<br />20. What is your capability to effectively manage simultaneous, geographically dispersed A&amp;AS task orders?<br />a. How can this capability be most effectively demonstrated to the Government under a solicitation? <br />21. Pre-Proposal Conference:<br />a. Do you think a pre-proposal conference is necessary for GEITA11? <br />b. If so, what topics would you like to have discussed in the government/contractor meeting?<br />22. There are positions that require a SECRET clearance; as a result your company must possess at least a SECRET facility clearance. If you do not have a facility clearance, what is your plan in obtaining the required clearance prior to contract award?<br />23. Please include the following with your response: <br />a. Name and address of firm <br />b. Point of contact and telephone number <br />c. Average annual revenue for the past 3 years and number of employees <br />d. Business size<br />e. Affiliate information: <br />i. Parent company<br />ii. Joint venture partners<br />iii. Potential teaming partners.</p>

<CONTACT>Shelby Burroughs, (520) 533-0437

<a href="mailto:shelby.burroughs@us.army.mil">ITEC4, Fort Huachuca DOC (NCR-CC)</a>
<DESC>The Army has developed a reference model for The Army Enterprise Network Operations - NetOps known as The Army LandWarNet NetOps Architecture - LNA providing an objective target for how NetOps will be managed across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>The Army LNA is the baseline enterprise NetOps reference architecture for the Armys LandWarNet. As an integrated architecture, the LNA provides an enterprise level Army statement of NetOps requirements through the Operational, Systems, and Technical views. These views together depict a holistic approach to NetOps with functional capabilities designed to support NetOps products, software, tools or systems, evaluation/selection.<BR><BR>Achieving NetOps systems interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise Infostructure is challenging due to the extraordinarily large and diverse organizations and existing stove-pipe tools and systems. Standardizing a scalable NetOps toolset is an Army priority.<BR><BR>An optimal way to achieve standardization and increase NetOps systems interoperability and integration is to address the acquisition process. As a result, it is the intent of the Army to enforce Compliance of the Armys LNA Capabilities into the NetOps systems selection and acquisition process to enhance and ensure interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>Army Regulation (AR) 25-1 mandates the assessment of NetOps products against the architecture to ensure they meet functional and interoperability requirements within the Army Enterprise. As a part of the Certificate of Networthiness - CoN approval process, all NetOps products - software, tools or systems must be compliant to the LNA.<BR><BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has responsibility to ensure all NetOps products are compliant to the LNA, prior to issuing a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN to acquire, field or connect to the Armys Enterprise. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS utilized on or for the LandWarNet, which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. These NetOps products securely manage, operate and maintain the network; they are not the network devices or elements themselves. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. <BR><BR>LNA Compliance generally refers to the measurement of a NetOps product in meeting the Army LNA Key Performance Parameters - KPPs and interoperability requirements and standards. The heart of the LNA Compliance process is the initial product assessment mapping to the LNA Capabilities, validation of the products functional capabilities and data flow interaction with other LNA Capabilities within the LNA.<BR><BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has developed LNA Compliance Checklists for each of the Armys current LNA Capabilities. Posting of these documents on the FedBizOpps is to provide the criteria required for NetOps products to be compliant to the LNA. These Checklists are available to Industry, providing vendors the ability to review and perform assessments of their NetOps products against the LNA requirements. Vendors desiring to access these LNA documents should MAP their NetOps product to the appropriate LNA Capability(s) identified in the NETCOM/9TH Signal Command LNA Bin Chart.  To access the LNA Bin Chart scroll down to Additional Info located near the bottom of this Synopsis page then place cursor and click mouse on URL text LNA Compliance Checklists/Documents.                                                              <BR>                                                       <BR>(Hyperlink to LNA BIN Chart is:  http://www.netcom.army.mil/LNA_Webpage/LNABIN.htm) <BR><BR>Compliance Checklists exist for each of the current LNA Capabilities and are linked via their respective capability block on the LNA Bin Chart identified above. To view LNA material related to any particular LNA Capability, click the text in the respective capability block of the LNA Bin Chart. This links to a Word Document which provides an overview or description of the specific LNA Capability, a graphical representation of the capabilities interface requirements with other LNA capabilities to include data exchanges, and further provides a link to the detailed LNA Compliance Checklists outlining functional and Interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>In order for NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet - LWN, to be considered for selection, Army requiring activities must obtain a Certificate of Networthiness from NETCOM/9th Signal Command, as stated in AR 25-1. See chapters 2-2, 2-15 thru 2-27, and 6-3. As a part of the CoN approval process, all NetOps products software, tools, or systems must be Compliant to the LNA. <BR><BR>Industry is encouraged to utilize these LNA Checklists to perform a self-assessment of their NetOps products to ensure their products compliance with the Armys LNA Compliance requirements. <BR><BR>It is recommended Army requiring activities utilize these checklists, as part of their market research, evaluation and acquisition process, for new or enhanced NetOps products, to ensure the products compliance to the LNA prior to seeking a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN from NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>When reviewing or preparing to acquire COTS NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet, Army Requiring Activities should obtain a completed LNA Compliance Checklist, from the vendor, for the LNA capability to which the NetOps product maps. The completed checklist is the vendors assessment of their products compliance to the LNA and will be viewed as the vendors certification of their NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA functional and interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>Army requiring activities should e-mail completed LNA Compliance Checklist and supporting documentation to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team at compliance.team@conus.army.mil. Vendors should not directly submit their completed checklists to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team.<BR><BR>These LNA Checklists and supporting documentation will be utilized by the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team in their assessment of the NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA, prior to a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN being granted by NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>Prospective procurement of such products will be advertised and procured by Army Agencies requiring products. <BR><BR><BR>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY. WE ARE NOT SOLICITING PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME.<BR>

<DESC>The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a presolicitation notice for this requirement on May 5, 2009 under Solicitation Number OPM049-09-R-0005. We cancelled that presolicitation notice on June 15, 2009. We are issuing this presolicitation notice under Solicitation Number OPM049-10-R-0001. As the Federal government&rsquo;s human resources agency, OPM administers insurance and retirement benefits for millions of Federal and United States Postal Service employees and annuitants and their eligible family members. As part of its mission to manage insurance benefits, OPM oversees BENEFEDS, an enrollment web site and customer service call center that currently performs enrollment and premium administration for the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) and payroll allotment for the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS). OPM has an ultimate vision for a &ldquo;one-stop shop&rdquo; for the administration of enrollment in our benefits programs. In this proposed procurement, we have short-term and long-term goals. We first intend to contract for current BENEFEDS functionality and some enhanced services. These include: &bull; FEDVIP Enrollment and Premium Administration &bull; FSAFEDS Allotment Administration &bull; basic decision support tools &bull; customer service/call center services &bull; MyBENEFEDS &ndash; expanded online account information and history Our plan is then to expand BENEFEDS over the next several years to include: &bull; FSAFEDS enrollment &bull; Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) premium administration &bull; a robust suite of decision support tools that will provide eligible individuals with assistance in making benefits decisions. Our long-term goal is to expand BENEFEDS to include enrollment, reconciliation, and premium administration for the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) and Federal Employees&rsquo; Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) programs. We wish to explore with the successful offeror the feasibility and steps necessary to accomplish this goal through requirements gathering and prototype development. However, we do not envision actually moving FEHB and FEGLI functions to BENEFEDS during the proposed contract. The performance period for the proposed contract is expected to be ten years: a five-year base period plus five one-year options. OPM intends to issue a request for proposals (RFP) on or about March 12, 2010. The RFP and all documents relating to this requirement will only be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site at https://www.fbo.gov. Offerors are responsible for monitoring the FBO web site for release of the RFP and all other documents relating to this requirement. We encourage offerors to register on the FBO web site for email notification of all actions relating to the RFP and for the interested vendors list. After we release the RFP, we will give offerors the opportunity to ask questions. We will include all questions and answers in an amendment to the RFP and post the amendment on the FBO web site. Because of the unique constraints and circumstances associated with the development and maintenance of the BENEFEDS web site, OPM plans to hold a preproposal conference on March 25, 2010 at our headquarters office located at 1900 E Street NW, Alan K. Campbell Auditorium (Ground Floor), Washington, D.C. 20415 from 9:00 AM until 12:30 P.M. During the preproposal conference, we will provide an overview of the RFP; demonstrate the current web site&rsquo;s capabilities; and answer questions. After we release the RFP, we strongly encourage offerors to submit questions prior to the preproposal conference. We encourage offerors to attend the preproposal conference. Attending the preproposal conference will help you learn more about our requirement and prepare a stronger proposal in response to the RFP. If you plan to attend the preproposal conference, you must email Cheryl D. Allen, Contracting Officer, at Cheryl.Allen@opm.gov by March 18, 2010 and include the following registration information: (1) Your company name; (2) Single company point of contact (first and last name, title, telephone number, fax number , email address, and mailing address); (3) Your company web site; (4) List of attendees (total number of your company employees expected to attend the preproposal conference, first and last names, titles, telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, and mailing addresses); (5) Your business classification code; and (6) One-page executive summary of your company (including a general overview of the services and products you offer) in Microsoft Word format or PDF format. Proposals will be due on or about May 6, 2010. The proposed acquisition will be unrestricted and we will consider all responsible sources that submit a proposal. We anticipate awarding the proposed contract by September 2010.

<DESC>Amendment 05:  The purpose of this amendment is to close the BAA effective 28 May 2010. <br /><br />Original Synopsis Below.   <br /><br />DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&amp;D) proposals in the area of short-range wide-field-of-view extremely-agile electronically-steered photonic emitters (SWEEPER).  The overall goal is to create a paradigm shift in active optical beam steering and sensing by developing chip-scale integrated photonic coherent beam-forming technologies that overcome the limits of opto- mechanical and electro optical systems while being constrained to small size, weight, and power (SWaP).  DARPA envisions that a successful SWEEPER program will establish photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology that will provide video frame rate beam steering speeds, and emit multiple beams with a total output power of 10 W.   All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail is preferred (darpa-baa-09-66@darpa.mil).  See attached Full DARPA-BAA-09-66 document. Important Dates:  Posting Date: June 24, 2009 Abstract Due Date: August 21, 2009 First Round Proposal Due Date: December 11, 2009

<SUBJECT>Distribution Labor for Temporary, Intermittent Support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and Defense Distribution Center (DDC) Mission 
<SOLNBR>SP3300-10-R-0009
<CONTACT>BRIAN R ROSE, Contract Specialist, Phone 717 770-4673, Email brian.rose@dla.mil - THOMAS F MARTINO, CONTRACTING OFFICER, Phone 717 770-6169, Fax 717 770-5689, Email thomas.martino@dla.mil
<DESC>The Defense Distribution Center (DDC) has a requirement to provide distribution labor services for temporary, intermittent support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and DDC mission.  The type of services include planning, program management, executing effective and efficient receiving, storage, physical inventory, packaging, care of supplies in storage (COSIS), stock control, stock selection, issue processing, packing, shipping, traffic management support, distribution of material, container fabrication, material processing center (MPC) functions, consolidation and containerization functions, ocean terminal operations, and kitting.  

A contract is required to support excess workload due to surge in order to avoid any degradation to the DDC/DLA mission.  A contract for labor to support workload surges and distribution contingency operations on an as needed  basis would provide for a stop-gap measure for unforeseen, unplanned, situations that the DDCs current workforce cannot absorb with regular work, overtime, reassignment, or temporary or permanent hiring actions.  This contract will provide labor to support workload surges, unforeseen/unplanned workload, contingency operations and special projects.  The Contractor may be required to provide a distribution capability that includes furnishing facilities, equipment, and materials and supplies to perform the requirements. Work could be performed anywhere in the DLA/DDC locations across Outside Continental United States (OCONUS), Continental United States (CONUS) and Hawaii.  

The DDC is seeking offerors to perform the above functions which will be evaluated utilizing a Lowest Price / Technically Acceptable source selection procedure. This procurement will be set-aside for a contractor qualified in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, using competitive procedures.  DDC released a DRAFT solicitation on 14 January 2010.  The issuance of the final solicitation has been postponed.  The DDC will update this synopsis with a revised date prior to issuing the final solicitation.  It is anticipated that the resultant contract will result in a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with cost reimbursement (no fee) contract line items.  The labor will be accomplished under the CPFF portion while materials and support costs as well as travel/training/conference costs will be reimbursed under the cost reimbursement (no fee) portion.  The Government intends to issue a single award from the solicitation.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to be a one-year base period and four one-year options. 

A pre-proposal conference is expected to be conducted at DDC.  Time and locations will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website concurrently with release of the final solicitation. 

The NAICS Code and Size Standard are: 493110 and $25.5 million, respectively. 

All documents to this solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://wwww.fedbizopps.gov/) under solicitation SP3300-10-R-0009.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the continuation of licensing and maintenance support service of HP/Mercury software.  The anticipated Firm-Fixed Price Contract has a period of three (3) years, a base year with two (2) one-year option periods.
The FAA, Air Traffic Organization, Facilities/Technical Operations, is conducting a Market Survey to determine interest in providing the above service.  The Software is located at the William J Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ and thus, all service will be performed at the location, via technical support. The Contractor must be an HP Authorized Services Management Partner (ASMP-S) that provides service from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (8 hours a day), Monday through Friday (5 days a week), excluding Federal holidays.  At the time of call-in, if an issue/s is not resolved, the support center must provide call back within two hours of the initial call.  
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 423430, Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers, with a small business size standard of 100 employees.
All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 15 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  
PURPOSE:This market survey is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.
The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

b.	The ability to conduct maintenance service from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (8 hours a day), Monday through Friday (5 days a week),excluding Federal holidays.
c.	The ability to call back within two hours of initial call if an issue/s is not resolved.

<DESC>The Forest Service has a requirement for Decommissioning of approximately 28.5 miles of National Forest System Roads. The work includes watershed restoration items on the central portion of the Priest Lake Ranger District. These items include obliterating existing roads by recontouring or partial recontouring of the original roadbed, and restoration of stream channels by removing associated fills, removing culverts and construction of gradient control structures. The work may also include placing roads into long term storage by decompacting the surface and constructing water bars. Additional work consists of construction of sediment basins and seeding, fertilizing and mulching. No formal pre-proposal site visit will be conducted but offerors are encouraged to visit the site. Offerors are also encouraged to review Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.237-1, Site Visit (Apr 1984). Failure of the Contractor to ascertain the nature, location, and conditions which affect the work will not relieve the contractor from the responsibility for successfully performing the work without additional expense to the Government. The project is located in Bonner County of Idaho and Pend Oreille County of Washington. The project roads are spread out over a large geographic area. In Idaho the roads are located in Townships 61 and 62 North, Range 5 West of the Boise Meridian. In Washington the roads are located in Township 36 North, Range 45 East of the Willamette Meridian. Refer to the vicinity map on the title sheet and sheets 29-34 of the plans for project location. For additional information regarding the site, contact Brent Briggs at 208-765-7436 or Dale Fife at 208-765-7432. The Service Contract Act does apply as well as the appropriate wage determination. The period of performance will be June 30, 2010 through October 15, 2010. All responsible small businesses may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Lack of registration in the CCR on part of the offeror will render a proposal ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//. The solicitation package is anticipated to be available electronically on or about 12 May 2010 with an anticipated closing date of 11 June 2010. NOTE: THIS PRE-SOLICITATION HAS A DUE DATE THAT IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THE OFFICIAL DUE DATE WILL BE INDICATED IN THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. ARRA Requirement: The Awardee will be subject to Section 1512(c) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Funds under the awarded contract. These reports will be made available to the public. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE GOVERNMENT PRIOR TO SEEING AND REVIEWING THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Email questions in writing to konevas@emai.nih.gov by 2:00 (EST) June 8, 2010.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of standardized, high-quality biospecimens is widely recognized as a significant roadblock to cancer research. The National Cancer Institute (NCI), through its Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research (OBBR), is leading a national initiative to systematically address and resolve one of the most difficult problems that will drive 21st century cancer research: the limited availability of carefully collected and controlled, high-quality human biospecimens annotated with essential clinical data and properly consented for broad investigational use. This issue has been repeatedly identified by the scientific community as a leading obstacle to progress in post-genomics cancer research, and the NCI is committed to resolving this complex problem through a multifaceted approach that addresses those factors under our control and provides insights that will inform broader policy making in this area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The NCI through its Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (NCI CBIIT) has sponsored the development of the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid&reg; (caBIG&reg;) initiative, a common informatics infrastructure that incorporates and encourages the use of common data standards. caBIG&reg; is an open source, open access information network connecting the cancer research community and enabling the sharing of data and tools. Using the caBIG&reg; infrastructure, researchers and clinicians can accelerate their ability to share, integrate and analyze data. By providing a comprehensive collection of interoperable software tools, data standards, and computing infrastructure, the caBIG&reg; initiative promotes data and knowledge exchange, simplifies collaboration, and ultimately helps realize the potential of molecular medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing NCI Specimen Resource Locator (SRL) is the product from the NCI Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) to create a cancer-focused locator service. Despite a low level of maintenance the use and wide sources of inquiries for this application has remained relatively consistent over time signifying an unfulfilled need for the locating specimens effectively. While the present SRL makes no use of caBIG&reg; technology the next phase will employ several including but not limited to: caGrid, Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository (caDSR), Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS), and the caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK). This will enable the creation and sharing of Common Biorepository Model (CBM) grid nodes at biorepositories in a revised SRL and allow for the sharing of de-identified summary-level specimen collection information. In addition, this will also enable the use of other caBIG&reg; compatible systems (such as caTissue Suite and caHUB Portal) and non-caBIG&reg; applications to use CBM as a service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of this RFP is the ongoing development of SRL. The initial focus of the contract will be on the Common Biorepository Model followed by the SRL web application with any needed architecture or updates to support the proposed SRL components. CBIIT has adopted a modified Unified Process Framework (UPF) methodology for software development. Each release cycle of the product can be divided in four phases - inception, elaboration, construction and transition. While individual teams may propose to employ various versions of UPF (e.g., Agile, Extreme or a more traditional RUP style development cycle), the goal is to build and deliver software iteratively with transparent methodologies and clear milestones to avoid a "waterfall" like development cycle. It is expected that there will approximately two release cycles per contract year over the total Period of Performance.</p>

<POPADDRESS>The majority of the work can be performed at the subcontractors facilities; but, with a preference to co-location at the NCI CBIIT office.  However, the SAIC-F COTR may ask that specific tasks, such as testing and demonstrations, be performed at other locations.

<DESC><p>SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION <br />Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule<br />&nbsp;<br />AGENCY: U.S. Small Business Administration.<br />&nbsp;<br />ACTION: Notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for <br />Herbicides, Insecticides, and Fungicides, under Product Service Code <br />(PSC) 6840, under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) <br />code 325320, Pesticide and Other Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing.<br />&nbsp;<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&nbsp;<br />SUMMARY: The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering <br />granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Herbicides, <br />Insecticides, and Fungicides, under PSC 6840, under NAICS code 325320. <br />According to a request, no small business manufacturers supply these <br />products to the Federal government. If granted, the waiver would allow <br />an otherwise qualified small businesses to supply the products of any <br />manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses, <br />service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or Participants in the <br />SBA's 8(a) Business Development (BD) Program.<br />&nbsp;<br />DATES: Comments and source information must be submitted June 3, 2010. <strong>EXTENTION GRANTED THROUGH JUNE&nbsp;11, 2010.</strong>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />ADDRESSES: You may submit comments and source information to Amy <br />Garcia, Procurement Analyst, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of <br />Government Contracting, 409 3rd Street, SW., Suite 8800, Washington, DC <br />20416.<br />&nbsp;<br />FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Amy Garcia, by telephone at (202) 205-<br />6842; by FAX at (202) 481-1630; or by e-mail at Amy.garcia@sba.gov.<br />&nbsp;<br />SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act <br />(Act), 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), and SBA's implementing regulations require <br />that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, <br />service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or Participants in the <br />SBA's 8(a) BD Program provide the product of a small business <br />manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual<br />manufacturer or processor of the product. This requirement is commonly <br />referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule. 13 CFR 121.406(b). Section <br />8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer <br />Rule for any ''class of products'' for which there are no small <br />business manufacturers or processors available to participate in the <br />Federal market. In order to be considered available to participate in <br />the Federal market for a class of products, a small business <br />manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation <br />or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 <br />months. 13 CFR 121.1202(c). The SBA defines ''class of products'' based <br />on the Office of Management and Budget's NAICS system and PSC to <br />further identify particular products within the NAICS code to which a <br />waiver would apply.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public is invited to comment or provide source information to <br />SBA on the proposed waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for this class <br />of product within 15 days after date of publication on FedBizOpps.gov.</p>

<DESC>UPDATE:  A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE HAS BEEN ISSUED IN RELATION TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  THE PRESOLICITATION NOTICE NUMBER IS 10-100-SOL-00019.

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY

This is a Sources Sought Notice and does not constitute a commitment by the Government.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.  Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately.  All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is pursuing multiple and parallel strategies to close the gap between current antiviral drug supply and the HHS goal of stockpiling approved agents and developing new antiviral agents as part of the strategic plan for pandemic preparedness.  HHS is particularly interested in the advanced development of new influenza antiviral agents or drug candidates effective against influenza designed to target novel mechanisms of action or to enhance effects of present classes of influenza antiviral drugs, formulated for long term stability, long bioavailability, and simple dosing regimens.  Ultimately, these influenza antiviral agents shall be produced at one or more Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed domestic manufacturing facilities and shall provide sufficient surge capacity to contribute substantially to U.S. and ideally global antiviral needs during an influenza pandemic. 

Respondents must meet the following mandatory qualification criteria:

1.	Demonstration of Advanced Development/U.S. Influenza Antiviral Agent Licensure/Approval 

It is essential that efforts funded subsequently shall lead to U.S. licensure/approval of an influenza antiviral agent that can be used to protect the U.S. population in the event of an influenza pandemic.  The Respondent must demonstrate significant progress towards development of an antiviral drug or biologic (not vaccines) by documenting the submission of an IND and completion of a final report, reviewed by the Respondent, of Phase I clinical trials for safety by the time of contract proposal submission.  Drug efficacy must be based on either of two criteria:  demonstrable ability to inhibit virus replication/spread, or demonstrable ability to produce an accelerated reduction of disease symptoms, including but not limited to a reduction of morbidity and mortality.

2.	U.S. Drug Manufacturing 

To provide U.S-based facilities, the Respondent may be a 1) single, fully integrated and independent pharmaceutical company, 2) partnership of a prime contractor with legitimate subsidiary or corporate partner that performs U.S based drug manufacturing and/or clinical studies, or 3) consortium with the Respondent as the prime contractor with subcontractors such as contract manufacturing organizations and/or contract research organizations as members that perform U.S. based drug/biologic manufacturing and/or clinical studies. 

3.	Production Capability

The Respondent must demonstrate sufficient production capacity to satisfy U.S. Government needs in the event of a declared influenza public health emergency.

The Government is seeking qualified small business concerns and seeks to obtain information regarding:  (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, veteran-owned small business , 8(a) small business, woman-owned small business or small disadvantaged business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 325414.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code is 500 employees.  Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether or not a set-aside is possible.  Teaming arrangements are encouraged.  An organization that is not a small business concern under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.  Submittals received from an organization that is not a small business concern will not be reviewed.

Respondents to this sources sought notice may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement, including a response to the requested information above, how they plan to meet the mandatory qualification criteria, an anticipated development plan of the product, and primary contact information at the organization (name, email address and telephone number) in the event HHS has additional questions or requires clarification of the submitted information.  Responses are limited to twenty (20) pages and must be submitted to the contact person listed below.  

It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be announced at the end of May 2010 with proposals due a minimum of forty five (45) days after RFP issuance.  While the mandatory qualification criteria do not have to currently be met, all of the mandatory qualification criteria must be met by proposal submission.  Proposals that do not meet the mandatory qualification criteria would not be considered for evaluation.

All responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall reference Sources Sought Notice Number:  10-100-SOL-00016.  Responses are to be submitted to Mekeba Barrett by 2:00 PM ET, May 10, 2010 at mekeba.barrett@hhs.gov.  

Any questions or comments relating to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically to mekeba.barrett@hhs.gov.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>This effort addresses the need for pixellated eye protection for the Soldier.  A goal of the research is to prove the compatibility of the plastic lens technology developed by Dynamic Eye with other eye protection technologies.

<DESC>Description of work:   This project is to be accomplished in two phases as described on drawing A-001.  While the contractor is renovating Area B (located on both the first and second floors) Area A will remain a active, frequently utilized live firing area.  It will be the contractor's responsibility to insure that they safely accomplish all work in one area so that it is completed and ready for beneficial occupancy. The contractor will not be permitted to have access in the other area until the first area is complete and ready for operation.  The contractor will be permitted to do the roofing work in the first phase.  The contractor will be required to develop a phased fire alarm installation plan to provide the facility with as much protection as practicable.  The contractor is responsible for insuring all personnel are provided daily safety briefings highlighting areas of concern.
This is a multi-story indoor firing range operation consisting of a total area of approximately 25,000 SF on the first floor (including small basement area) and 14,000 SF on the second floor (including roof level stair/elevator vestibule area).  The scope of renovations is limited to 572SF at basement level, 6,756 SF at first floor, 7,780 SF at second floor and 340 SF at roof level stair/elevator vestibule area).  Total renovated area is therefore approximately 15,448 SF.  In general, the scope of work involves demolition and removal of existing small weapons fire training facilities in four primary training room/spaces and miscellaneous adjacent spaces to conclude stair wells, corridors, and elevator shaft.  The major training rooms/spaces contain flexible simulated residential floor plan settings.  Partitions are movable and consists of ballistic resistant steel panels.  Typically, the walls, flooring, and ceilings of the training spaces are protected with layers of rubber curtains and or plants.  Other systems are also being renovated to include HVAC, electrical, and fire protection.  The existing HVAC system serving the renovated is bade on a supply system through the floor and the return at the ceiling.  This system concept is being reversed with supply from the ceiling and return through the floor.  
This project also removes, replaces and upgrades the movable ballistic wall panel system, and associated lamella rubber system in the training areas. This effort includes the replacement of 250 panels, 3' wide x 8' high in both Areas.  Panels include a ballistic resistant steel frame and ballistic resistant interior steel panel, and are covered with a layer of 1/4: self-healing fire retardant rubber linear material.  Scope also includes a new overhead track system for panels. Replacement of the lamella bullet trap protection is also included in the basic scope of this project.  The project also provides for the complete phased replacement of the fire alarm system and panel.
