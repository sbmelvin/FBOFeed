This is the only organization that has established such a program and AHRQ feels this is the only organization that can enhance research knowledge and growth for potential pediatric researchers.   The APA mission is accomplished through patient care, academics (teaching and research), and advocacy-Patient safety is a major initiative of AHRQ and HHS.  This APA program is vital to AHRQ because it will allow young investigators to continue to conduct important studies relevant to child health services research.  It also is important because significant research findings emerging from studies (e.g., emergency pediatrics, quality of health and healthcare for children, critical care, adolescent medicine, behavior and development, and neonatology) that translate research into practice are being published and disseminated through national health journals.  APA has the expertise and familiarity of child health services research and the understanding of the range of children's health care issues.  It's imperative that APA continues to implement this innovative research program with AHRQ's support in providing research opportunities for young researchers.

<DESC>Contract Care Coordination Demonstration Industry Day Announcement To execute the requirements of Public Law 109-114, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration’s (VHA) Chief Business Office (CBO) is hosting an Industry Day forum to initiate partnership support with Industry and Academia to implement care management strategies that have proven valuable in the broader public and private sectors. VHA CBO’s mandated goal is to establish at least three managed care demonstration programs designed to satisfy a set of health system objectives related to arranging and managing care by the end of calendar year 2006.   To that end, VA needs to formulate demonstration objectives in collaboration with industry and academia.  To be successful in those objectives it is essential that care purchased for enrollees from private sector providers be secured in a cost effective manner, in a way that complements the larger VHA system of care, and preserves important agency interest, such as sustaining a partnership with university affiliates. As a result of that collaboration, industry partners will be given the opportunity to bid on multiple competitive awards that include the designs incorporated through public-private participation.   And Academic Partners will have the opportunity to actively participate on VA Executive Steering committees that will significantly improve health care management strategies.  The Request for Information/collaboration phase of this acquisition will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.201(b) where ”the purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government’s requirements, and enhancing the Government’s ability to obtain quality supplies and services, including construction, at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.” The Contract Care Coordination Demonstration final acquisition approach will be determined and announced after evaluation of Industry recommendations.  Known factors are that the acquisition shall have provisions to conduct at least three managed care demonstration programs designed to satisfy a set of health system objectives related to arranging and managing care, be comprehensive in scope, and serve a substantial patient population. Contract Care Coordination Industry Day will be held at Hyatt Regency Crystal City, Reagan National Airport, 2799 Jefferson Highway, Arlington, VA  22202, on ___February 2, 2006 , at _1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. EST.

The NAICS code for this procurement is 812332 and the small business size standard is 13.0 million dollars.  In order to assure that VAPHS can make award to a responsible offeror who demonstrates his/her capability to handle the contract volume and requirements contained in the Performance Work Statement, while promoting Dept. of Veterans Affairs goals to award contracts to certain socio-economically disadvantaged business concerns, the method of award with regard to business size and socio-economic status of offerors will be a ‘cascade set-aside’ procedure.  All responsible offerors are invited to submit offers in response to this RFP; first award priority will be given to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns, second award priority will be given to Small Business (SB) concerns, and last priority will be given to other-than-small business concerns.

This is a competitive negotiated procurement at all levels of the cascade, and will be issued in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.    A technical proposal as well as a price proposal will be required, and information regarding the required content of the technical proposal will be contained in the solicitation.   The solicitation (RFP 244-06-01362 or ‘RFP’) will be issued o/a 5/5/06.  The RFP will advise offerors of a date for the on-site Pre-Proposal conference, at which time the Government will address questions and/or requests for clarifications, information, or other general discussion items in order to promote complete understanding of contract requirements.  Details regarding the pre-proposal conference and acceptance of advance questions for same will be included in the RFP.  All offerors are invited and encouraged to attend the pre-proposal conference, although offerors are advised that any material change to the RFP resulting from discussions during the conference will be made available to all offerors, via a written amendment to the solicitation.  It will be expected that offerors will have reviewed the solicitation in its entirety prior to submitting questions or requests for information.   Site visits to the VAPHS facilities will be by appointment only and requests will be made to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) listed in the RFP.  No questions regarding specific RFP requirements and/or no requests for site visit will be entertained PRIOR to the issuance of the solicitation document.  Offerors may contact the Contracting Officer at any point during the solicitation process for assistance in understanding legal contract requirements, developing appropriate proposals for submission, or satisfying certain general requirements; including mandatory registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (http://www.ccr.gov) completion of online ‘Representations and Certifications’ (http://www.orca.bpn.gov) , and compliance with VETS-100 reporting requirements (http://vets100.cudenver.edu).

Requests for the solicitation document will also be accepted by the Contracting Officer via hard copy mail at the Agency address above, or by e-mail (Janet.Leuthold@med.va.gov).

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for a software and hardware upgrade to an existing three dimensional deformation and strain measurement system.The upgrade system includes a Shearography Camera Module, PISA ESP/Shearography Software Upgrade,Software upgrades for 1 year, Laser Illumination, Installation and Training and a standard 1 year warranty. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Trilion Quality Systems LLC, 200 Barr Harbor Drive, Suite 400, West Conshohocken, PA 19428. The lack of competition is due to the hardware/software upgrade, described above, being an integrated add-on to the existing deformantion and strain measurement system originally purchased from Trilion Quality Systems LLC. Only some of the components within the existing system will be replaced or modified. Purchase of this equipment from a different vendor would result in unacceptable hardware and software incompatibilities due to the proprietary nature of the existing system. Since this is an upgrade of existing hardware and software, it is only available from Trilion Quality Systems LLC. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 9, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is soliciting proposals to take advantage of the growing strength of established primary care Practice Based Research Networks (PBRNs) in order to understand what is happening in community-based primary care practices and how those practices can be transformed.  The purpose of the Primary Care Practice Based Research Network (PBRN) is to perform studies that can be conducted quickly which focus on demand-driven, practical, applied topics that are of interest to primary care PBRN participants as well as AHRQ and its partners.  The research will either address pressing questions related to the appropriate care of health conditions seen in primary care settings, or will assess a technology, product, tool or primary care delivery strategy proposed for the health care system.  The assumption is that the findings of research conducted in actual community-based settings will have strong external validity and, once disseminated, will be readily implementable in primary care practice settings.  AHRQ anticipates awarding 8-12 task order contracts from this one solicitation.  AHRQ is particularly interested in receiving proposals from primary care PBRNs engaged in rapid turn-around research leading to new knowledge and information that contributes to improved primary care practice.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that best describes the requirement is 541990.  The small business size standard is $6.5 million (provided for information only, as this procurement is advertised on a limited competition among qualified offerors basis). This procurement is open to any primary care PBRN that meets the qualifications specified herein, including (but not limited to) those currently or previously funded by AHRQ.  To be eligible as a contractor, the PBRN must meet or exceed the following qualifications:  The PBRN organizational structure includes a core of at least 30 ambulatory practices and/or 50 clinicians devoted to the primary care of patients.  The majority of the practices should be located in the U.S.  Networks that individually are unable to meet this requirement are encouraged to form a partnership with one or more additional networks, although a single PBRN must be formally designated the prime contractor. The network has an accepted, written statement of its purpose and research mission, which includes an ongoing commitment to research endeavors that transcends a single study. A director has been identified who is responsible for most administrative, financial and planning functions. The director is, or will be, supported by a staff of at least one person. The network has immediate access to consultants with expertise in such areas as biostatistics, research methodology, and clinical quality improvement. The PBRN has in place multiple systems of communication with and among participating practices in the form of regularly produced newsletters, e-mail or list-servs, conference calls, and/or face-to-face meetings of various combinations of network members. The PBRN can document completion of at least one publishable research study that involved primary data collection within the network.
In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ’s site at http://ahrq.gov . Once in AHRQ’s homepage go to “Funding Opportunities”, then to “Contracts”, and then to “Request for Proposal (RFP)”. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about May 15, 2006 with proposals due August 29, 2006.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) will be conducting  competition to enter into a performance-based contract to support the development, engineering, integration and test, operations and maintenance, and evolution of the Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) program, and an Archive, Access and Distribution System (AADS).  This requirement will be a Small Business Set-Aside using NAICS code 517110 with a size standard of 1,500 employees.  This requirement was previously cancelled from COMMITS NexGEN program  (Request for Solution T3-0005).  A draft solicitation may be released as early as two weeks from the post date of this synopsis.

This Program will enable NESDIS to better meet NOAA’s responsibility for long-term archiving of the Nation’s environmental data.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is responsible for archival storage and management of environmental data and information, and has hundreds of millions of environmental observations stored on a variety of media dating back as far as the mid-1899s.  These data support the Nation’s ability to ensure human safety and welfare, sustain economic stability and growth, and maintain environmental integrity.  The ability to archive, integrate, access, and distribute environmental data and information is critical to the fulfillment of NPAA’s strategic goals.  Today, there are demands on virtually all of NOAA’s programs to provide information on the health of the environment in real-time.  The CLASS program is NOAA’s major initiative to re-engineer, modernize, and enhance the current suite of National environmental archive and access services to better serve the current and future environmental data and information needs of the Nation.

Meeting requirements for a highly reliable and evolutionary environmental archival and distribution system of the CLASS magnitude is a very large task.  A key element in this effort is the understanding that contractor provided Information Technology (IT) and related services can provide an important infrastructure for the CLASS program business functions.  In addition, the performance-based arrangement envisioned provides for the contractor’s payment and incentives to be based on meeting service levels necessary to efficiently and economically support NESDIS in maintaining and evolving CLASS. 

NESDIS seeks a contractor that will bring a mission focus providing highly effective, secure and reliable computing and telecommunications resources.  Further, the successful contractor must also continuously identify methods for applying information technology to improve NESDIS' mission performance and reduce total program costs.  NESDIS seeks a contractor that brings proven expertise to identify, implement, and manage effective and efficient application and use of information technology to meet the CLASS mission.  NESDIS is anticipating a best-value procurement emphasizing a stable cost environment with a potential term of ten (10) years.

<ARCHDATE>07152006
<CONTACT>Nancy Leggett, Contracting Officer, Phone (937) 255-4284, Fax (937) 656-5686, Email Nancy.Leggett@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The Special Operations Systems Group (SOFSG), Battlefield Airmen Flight (BA) seeks to acquire and field a Battlefield Air Targeting Micro Air Vehicle (BATMAV) system that provides the best overall value to meet the small unit’s need for real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) and battle damage assessment (BDA).  The system shall have the flexibility to be modified through a Block Upgrade approach as technology matures and funding becomes available through the POM cycle.  The objective for Block 0 is for the delivery of specification compliant systems IAW the contract delivery schedule, delivery of the required data items and products, and execution of the associated program support.  At a minimum, the system shall meet the BATMAV initial screening criteria, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), and Airworthiness Requirements.  The objective for further blocks is for continued Spiral Development and Horizontal Technology insertion.

SOFSG plans to issue formal RFP Number FA8629-06-R-2351 for the BATMAV system on or about 30 May 2006, with proposals due on or about 30 June 2006.  The procurement will be a small business set-aside.  The Government anticipates the requirement for BATMAV will be approximately 314 systems for the primary customer.  (30 in FY07, 75 in FY08, 116 in FY09 and 93 in FY10)However, the contract is being structured on an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity basis, so that other interested customers can also use this vehicle to purchase the system.  The initial delivery order will include the necessary integration effort for the Block 0 system (FY06 funding).  Options for production, training and sustainment will also be placed on the initial delivery order for execution after production and operations funds become available in FY07.  Thirty (30) systems are required for the initial delivery order.

Utilizing the Best Value approach, the government will consider innovative or individualized solutions to meeting the system and program requirements.  However, the contractor is encouraged to provide representative systems as rapidly as possible.  To this end, a system demonstration will be included as part of the source selection, in order to determine each offeror's baseline capability.  It is anticipated that the contractor will provide the fastest practical schedule and an alternate schedule which would accommodate additional customers.  

The proposed system shall consist of the following basic components: 
Ground Control Station (GCS) (1 per system)
Air Vehicle (AV)(2 per system)
AV Payload 
Field Repair Kit 
any equipment required for flight preparation, launch or recovery
power sources and 
tactical packaging (if required)

The Government contemplates a contract that shall provide for an initial delivery order to include any initial integration efforts that need to be accomplished to meet the required baseline.  The configuration shall be used to meet the government’s fielding requirements and provide the initial baseline, Spiral Development and Horizontal Technology Insertions (SD/HTI), activities.

The configuration shall consist of the following: 
BATMAV systems (described above)
Contractor and Government Technical Testing
Logistics Support (support equipment such as battery charger, launch assist device (if required), spares; training (including the systems to be used during training); technical manuals; and contractor logistics support).  

Draft technical requirements will be posted on line at FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov or PIXS at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil for review and comment as soon as possible.  A copy of the formal RFP Number FA8629-06-R-2351 may be accessed via the internet on or about 30 May 2006 on FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov or PIXS at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil   All questions and comments must be submitted electronically to Ms. Nancy Leggett, Battlefield Airmen Contracting Officer at Nancy.Leggett@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>The Office of International Affairs (INA), US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is acquiring hotel accommodations with conference facilities and related services for the purpose of conducting International Air Cargo Interdiction Training (IACIT) with Turkmenistan during the period of May 12-20, 2006. The party of participants is comprised of CBP employees, Contractors, and/or representatives from foreign governments, all working on official US Government business.

High quality facilities and relating services are required for this event. Contractor facilities that currently have 3 Star/3 Diamond ratings or higher (for 5 increment rating systems) from organizations such as AAA, OAG, Travelocity, Orbitz, etc. are desired. See statement of work and the evaluation of quotations section of the solicitation document for details.

This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer/quotation that requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.

CBP is a federal government agency and as such is exempt from most sales and occupancy taxes for goods and services it acquires directly, via purchase order as in this case. A NY State tax exemption form (ST-129) will be completed and submitted to the successful Contractor after award. 

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested via the relating solicitation that has been uploaded at this website, RFQ HSBP1006Q0762. This is a RFQ in accordance with FAR Part 13. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-07 (FEB 2006) and the Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR). It is the responsibility of the vendor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. This RFQ will be issued exclusively through this Government Point of Entry (Fedbizopps.gov). All future information about this acquisition including amendments to this procurement requirement will also be distributed through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible vendor whose quotation conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Responses will be evaluated on the basis of best value. Evaluation Factors are Technical Acceptability (required accommodations, services etc.) Past Performance and Price. Technical Acceptability is more important than Past Performance. Both Technical Acceptability and Past Performance are more important than Price. While Technical Acceptability is the most important criteria, CBP still desires to acquire the accomodation services at rates near the current GSA perdiem level ($162.00 for Nassau County).

NOTE: Offerors/Quoters must be registered at  WWW.CCR.GOV in order to be eligible for award.

Uploaded files include the following: 1) solicitation document (HSBP1006Q0762), 2) Bid Schedule in Excel format.

<SUBJECT>70--SEWP III EXTENSIONS
<SOLNBR>RFP5-51953-026
<RESPDATE>051506
<ARCHDATE>04282007
<CONTACT>Darlene E Dorsey, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 286-5063, Fax (301) 286-6299, Email Darlene.E.Dorsey@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to contract for a no-cost extension for the continuation of a specialized suite of contracts that supply Information Technology (IT) equipment and software to the Federal Government through a Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) specifically identified as SEWP III. The following contracts are affected by the intended extensions: Contract  NAS5-01133 Hewlett-Packard (HP) Contract  NAS5-01134 Government Technology Sales, Inc.(GTSI)/Sun	       Microsystems Contract  NAS5-01135 IBM Contract  NAS5-01138 Government Micro Resources, Inc. (GMR)/Cray Contract  NAS5-01139 Hewlett-Packard (HP)/Compaq Contract  NAS5-01140 Silicon Graphics, Inc. Contract  NAS5-01142 Government Technology Sales, Inc.(GTSI) Contract  NAS5-01144 UNISYS Contract  NAS5-01145 Government Micro Resources, Inc.(GMR) NASA GSFC does not intend to increase the maximum ordering value of the contracts.  The extension of delivery order requirements is up to six additional months (3-month basic with one 3-month option) beginning July 30, 2006 through October 29, 2006.  If the option is exercised, the period of performance will be October 30, 2006 through January 29, 2007.   The contract extensions are required to ensure uninterrupted support and to meet critical requirements until the follow-on competitive contract is awarded.  This procurement action is being conducted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2)- Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  The highly specialized nature of the SEWP III contracts combined with the highly automated and optimized acquisition schedule enable customers to get critical items for a wide diversity of projects and programs not obtainable elsewhere in the Federal Government within the required time frame.  SEWP, unlike any other available GWAC, is centered around high-end, state of the art technology.  While many general commodity, low-priced (under $2500) items exist on SEWP, the urgency of extending SEWP III until SEWP IV is in place is in the availability of the newer, higher priced technology, which is both more critical and difficult to obtain in a timely fashion elsewhere.  Delay in the award of the extensions of the SEWP III contracts will result in serious injury to major Government programs by either the unavailability of the required hardware/software and/or additional financial cost.  It is not practical or cost effective to conduct a full and open competition for six months of support as a precursor to the award of a follow-on contract.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 15, 2006.  Interested organizations must provide documentation which establishes its capability in the required areas including documentation of past relevant experience.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Precision Engineering Division of the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with the University of Maryland, of College Park, Maryland for scientific services for the instrumentation development for nanoscale measurement and manipulation.

This requirement will involve developing software to simulate motion of nanoparticles in an optical-tweezers-based nanoassembly instrument, to develop instrumentation and image processing software to measure the positions of microspheres and nanoparticles in the instrument, and to perform laboratory measurements to measure the performance of these programs and fabricate structures by positioning microspheres and nanoparticles on substrates.

The control system operates a nanoassembly tool, and incorporates a number of network-based software modules that control assembly hardware, provide a graphical user interface (GUI), image and visualize the nanoassembly workspace, and control the overall system. Based on market research there is no other system available that can perform a similar function or design.

The University of Maryland has developed the system software, including the communication interfaces, a graphical user interface, and the instrument controller.  The University of Maryland designed the new architecture and the modules that must be completed in this next phase of development.  Therefore, the University of Maryland is the only vendor that NIST is aware of that appears capable of completing the development of this system.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541690, and the size standard of $6.5 Million.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, parties that are capable of providing the services noted above may respond to this notice and clearly demonstrate their capabilities in detail so that NIST may evaluate them.  Such notice shall be received by May 8, 2006.  The Government will then determine whether this procurement could be competed.  A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition will be based upon responses to this notice.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION
This is a Request for Information (RFI) concerning potential rapid un-surfaced airfield assessment also termed “Runway Hardness.”   Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to perform studies and analyses to determine potential solutions in determining surface/subsurface shear strength.  California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is the desired determining factor for predicting ground shear strength.  Current methods for determining in situ CBR use cone penetrometers where the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) is the only consistently accurate method.  The Airfield Cone Penetrometer (ACP) can provide CBR for soils with CBRs up to 15.  For gaining data on soils with CBRs greater than 15, a DCP must be used.  Both methods measure the CBR by forcing a cone-shaped device, with a known cross-sectional surface area, into the ground.  Cross-sectional area, force, and distance traveled are used to determine the CBR of the soil.  Ultimately, the Air Force seeks an improved method for measuring CBR.  

The Government does not intend to pay for any information solicited through this RFI.

This RFI is intended to solicit information on Immediate, Short Term, and Long Term solutions.  All responses should indicate the appropriate time frame for the solution provided.        

Immediate solutions require less than 12 months to develop and satisfy at least the first two criteria listed below.  
Short Term solutions require less than 24 months to develop and satisfy at least the first four criteria listed below.
Long term solutions require 2 years or more to develop and satisfy all of the criteria listed below.

Information submitted should address the below listed criteria.  However, the list is not inclusive as the government seeks industry input for best practices/standards.  The list reflects the Government order of precedence with the top being most important.

1) Be able to accurately and repeatedly measure the ground shear strength in terms of CBR to a depth of 36” (3 feet).

2) Be man-packable and portable
    (a) Unit, if/when collapsed, should be similar in dimensions to current DCP 
    (b) Weigh no more than 20 pounds (Objective); 30 pounds (Threshold).

3) No detectable signatures beyond 1000’ (Objective); 2500’ (Threshold) (e.g. Acoustic, Thermal, Magnetic, Radar, Light).

4) Not require excessive power consumption (e.g. not require mains current/voltage); Work on commercially available batteries or fuel cell. No combustion engines.

5) Unit requires no more than one person to operate (Objective); requires the need for two person team (threshold).

6) Be able to accomplish primary measurement with minimal operator input; (e.g, pull a trigger, push button); simplicity is key.

7) Provide a visual data output and electronically store the data.

8) Unit should enable individual to obtain accurate repeatable measurements +/- 5% (Objective) and +/- 10% (Threshold) as compared to DCP measurements at the same location within 1 minute (Objective) and 5 minutes (Threshold) and then move to the next user determined location for continuation measurements without excessive establishment or set-up time.
 
Particular attention should be devoted to equipment size and weight, along with human presence, as well as accurate and reliable CBR measurements to a depth of 36”.

Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to provide relevant examples of ongoing and previous contractual efforts with the Government that support the desired capabilities described.   Respondents are encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately.  The Government reserves the right to ask respondents to provide additional information/details based on initial submittals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT WITH THE MAKAH TRIBE FOR THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE (NMFS).  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT IS TO PROVIDE ESTIMATES FOR THE ENCOUNTER RATES OF SUB-LEGAL CHINOOK SALMON AND NON-TARGET SALMON IN WASHINGTON TREATY AND NON-TREATY TROLL FISHERIES.  THE PACIFIC SALMON TREATY RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR INCIDENTAL FISHING MORTALITY.  THE CHINOOK TECHNICAL COMMITTEE (CTC) CONCLUDED THAT THE COAST-WIDE MAGNITUDE OF INCIDENTAL FISHING MORTALITY FOR ALL SIZES OF CHINOOK IS IN THE RANGE OF 30 TO 50 PERCENT OF THE REPORTED CATCH.  CURRENTLY, ESTIMATES OF ENCOUNTERS OF SUB-LEGAL FISH ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON VERY LIMITED DATA.  THE CURRENT DATA ON ENCOUNTER RATES IN THE WASHINGTON TROLL FISHERY IS BASED ON LOGBOOK DATA FROM THE 1970S.  THIS STUDY IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE DATA NEEDS OF THE CTC BY GENERATING MORE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF ENCOUNTER RATES IN THE TREATY AND NON-TREATY COMMERCIAL TROLL FISHERY.  ESTIMATES OF ENCOUNTER RATES WILL BE MADE BY DIRECT OBSERVATION OF SUB-LEGAL CHINOOK AND OTHER SPECIES ENCOUNTERED IN THE WASHINGTON TROLL FISHERY WITH A PRECISION SUCH THAT 95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE INTERVAL IS NO GREATER THAN 10 PERCENT OF THE POINT ESTIMATE OF THE SUB-LEGAL PORTION.  THE ESTIMATES WILL BE MADE BY AREA, MONTH AND SPECIES STRATA.  THE PACIFIC SALMON COMMISSION CONCLUDED A NEW AGREEMENT IN JUNE OF 1999 THAT ESTABLISHED A NEW ABUNDANCE-BASED MANAGEMENT APPROACH FOR MANAGING THE CHINOOK FISHERIES.  THE ABUNDANCE BASED MANAGEMENT PLAN INCLUDED ASSIGNMENTS OF NEW DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS TASKS TO THE PACIFIC SALMON COMMISSION’S CHINOOK TECHNICAL COMMITTEE (CTC).  THE MAKAH FISHERY BIOLOGISTS MANAGE A MAJOR PORTION OF THE TROLL FISHERY WHERE THIS STUDY WILL BE CONDUCTED, AND ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH ITS CONDUCT AND THE FISHERMEN WHO PARTICIPATE IN IT.  THE USE OF ONBOARD OBSERVERS ON TREATY TROLL VESSELS MAKES UP THE MAJOR PORTION OF THIS PROJECT.  THE MAKAH FISHERY MANAGERS MANAGE THE TREATY TROLL FISHERY AND WORK CLOSELY WITH THEIR TRIBAL FISHERMEN.  THE MAKAH TRIBE IS THE ONLY KNOWN SOURCE THAT POSSESSES ACCESS TO TROLL FISHERY FISHERMEN AND SIMILAR EXPERIENCE CONDUCTING ENCOUNTER RATES OF SUB-LEGAL CHINOOK SALMON.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE FOR ONE YEAR FROM DATE OF AWARD.  THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000.

<DESC>Contract Care Coordination Demonstration Program Sustaining Partnerships, Managing Costs and Increasing Efficiency: VHA’s Agenda for Today and Tomorrow In an effort to include Industry and Academia in the collaboration phase of the Contract Care Coordination Demonstration program, VHA is requesting that interested partners submit corporate capability statements to Donald.Monaco@va.gov .    VHA has also developed a draft set of objectives to meet the intent of Public law 109-114.  VHA is specifically soliciting your input on these or other objectives you may suggest.  Please only respond to questions that are applicable to your experience and business line.  You are requested indicate if your response contains proprietary information that you do not want to share outside of the VHA and its consultants. 1.	VHA specifically solicits your input for: •	Increase the efficiency of VHA processes associated with purchasing care from commercial or other external sources •	Reduce the rate of cost growth associated with purchased care •	Implement management systems and quality processes that make contracted providers virtual high quality extensions of the VHA •	Control administrative costs and limit administrative cost growth to a rate less than that experienced in cost of care •	Enhance net collections of revenues earned through provision of care •	Increase enrollee satisfaction with VHA services 2.	If you are a current VHA affiliated or contracted provider or business partner, what “lessons learned” or recommendations can you share to help VHA become a better business partner?  Please highlight business capabilities/processes that VHA needs to develop or refine to achieve this goal. 3.	What guidance would you offer VHA in developing a comprehensive, cost-effective, high quality provider network while ensuring the continuance of long-standing local affiliate and contract relationships?  Please provide your suggestions for specific contract requirements and performance standards. 4.	Where VA requires an expanded provider network, what would you advise regarding best strategies for scoping, designing and securing provider networks?  Please address opportunities and obstacles for risk, shared savings, use fees, leased network arrangements or some combination of the above. 5.	For authorized services referred to a contracted network, what should be the contractors role in assisting patients with actually making an appointment with a network provider.  6.	How essential to program effectiveness and network sustainment is the establishment of fiscal intermediary or contractor claims processing arrangements? 7.	The VA needs to improve collections from third parties.  These collections can arise from VA provision of services or coordination of benefits where other health insurance should be primary.  Based on your experience, what are the critical processes/capabilities for coordination of benefits and third party collections?  How should VHA write the requirement and what are your suggestions for performance standards 8.	How would you characterize the optimum relationship between a supporting contractor and the government?  What specifically can/should be done to foster such a relationship? 9.	What is your experience with facility optimization programs that provide critical staff or medical resources that improve the overall capacity of hospitals that would be of interest to the veteran community? Please provide suggestions for contract requirements and performance standards 10.	What is your experience with increasing the efficiency of specialty referral processes to include authorization, benefit determination, referral and data sharing that would/should be of interest to the veteran community?     11.	The VHA contemplates developing a global contract with a single entity to recommend and contract for one or more of the following:  disease and case management, end of life and lifestyle improvement programs that can improve care, reduce costs and

<DESC>Subject: Questions related to SOW (Document No. 06-LUHJ-005) 

Clarification and guidance for the purpose of accurately proposing a solution to the AF's requirements are as follows: 
 
Section 2.0 Applicable Documents: reference paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 (Military Specifications and Standards) of the SOW. What is meant by the term “as guidance only” in this paragraph? This statement is contradicted in Sections 3.2.4(Operating Environment) , 3.2.5 (Maintainability), and 3.2.6 (Electromagnetic Radiation)
RESPONSE #1: The term “as guidance only” will be removed from the paragraph. Note the second sentence in the paragraph clarifies the issue further by granting the contractor latitude in proposing alternative commercial standards, etc. 
Can our team provide the government with a solution that is NOT MIL-STD or MIL-Spec per 2.1 and 2.2 for this procurement. Are the existing commercial standards for the Amptec 630BN acceptable to be proposed in meeting the government’s requirements (as in line 2 of section 2.0). 
RESPONSE #2: This question has already been answered by Response #1. Note that the present AMPTEC 630BN Test Set has been board certified by the US Navy Tomahawk Cruise Missile and Standard Missile Safety Board approved. Modifications to the JSSE shall meet the requirements of paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2.
We would propose a commercially developed tester and if required by the end user and would also provide the “additional” costs of testing the units per the MIL-STD and MIL-Specs identified in sections 2.1. And 2.2 as an added cost to this item. (Optional line pricing for any MIL STD Testing and Certifications).
RESPONSE #3: All test costs for the modified JSSE shall be included in the price of the modified JSSE. 
Section 2.1, MIL-HDBK-5400 states on the front page that “This handbook is for guidance only. Is this document as a requirement? Also, this handbook was written for Airborne Electronic Equipment. We believe it is not applicable for this project.
RESPONSE #4: MIL-HDBK-5400 is a requirement as stated in paragraph 2.1
Section 2.2, MIL-STD-130K called out a date of 10 Oct 03 and IHS only has the date of 15 Jan 00.
RESPONSE #5: The date for MIL-STD-130K will be changed to 15 JAN 00.
Section 3.1.6 Engineering Data: specifies that the contractor will develop the TDP to allow for the ability of another “competent” manufacturer the ability to produce an item from this package. Is a commercial manual acceptable for this requirement? 
RESPONSE #6: Paragraph 3.1.6 refers to a complete TDP, to include drawings and blueprints. A commercial manual by itself will not satisfy this requirement.
Section 3.2.8, the SOW states “The JSE shall be able to operate on battery power or recharge and operate from a 120/220 VAC, 60-50 Hz…….” So the question is does the government need the rechargeable capability in this unit? If so then we are OK with that requirement. 
RESPONSE #7: The Government desires rechargeable capability for the JSSE, as well as the other characteristics listed in 3.2.8.
Section 3.3 Performance Characteristics has changed once again back to the incorrect specifications that we had addressed in our previous attempt to update the specifications.
Please reference Document 05-LUHJ-004 rev A dated 31 August 2005. (Section 3.3 
Our team provided (and will provide again) what we believe the correct specifications for this instrument for Sections 3.3.1 (Voltage Test), 3.3.2 (Resistance Test), 3.3.3 (Stray Voltage Test) and 3.3.4( Load Test) should be. They are as follows: 
Section 3.3.1 (Voltage Test): Should be changed to read: The JSSE shall measure voltage from 0-200 VDC maximum and the voltage tolerance needs to be changed to ± 0.05 % of range (200V). This calculation works out to 10 counts on a 20K count display.
RESPONSE #8: The government concurs with this clarification and will change the SOW accordingly. 
Section 3.3.2 (Resistance Test): Should be changed to read: The JSSE shall measure the circuit resistance from 0-200 Kilo Ohm with an accuracy of within ± 0.05 % of range (200k ohm). For circuit resistance of 1 Mega Ohm or greater, within ± 0.1 % of range. We propose to supply a meter with a 2.0 Mega Ohm range which would could count up from 0 to 1.9999 Mega Ohms (4.5 digit display).
RESPONSE #9: The government concurs with the clarification as suggested and will change the SOW accordingly. The Government declines comment on, and does not endorse, the contractor’s proposal concerning a meter with a 2.0 mega-ohm range. 
Section 3.3.3 (Stray Voltage Test): For the 50mVDC measurement we propose the meter with a 200mVDC range with an accuracy of ± 0.25 % of range. For the 50mVAC measurement we propose the meter with a 200mVAC range with an accuracy of ± 0.25 % of range. This is for an AC frequency band width from 60hZ to 1khZ. 
RESPONSE #10: The Government does not recognize this as a Contractor proposal. Section 3.3.3 will be changed to reflect appropriate JSSE specifications on this subject.
Section 3.3.4(Load Test): The JSSE shall be capable of inducing a calibrated load sufficient to draw 4 Amperes of current on it’s 20 amp range (up to 19.999 amperes) with an accuracy within ± 0.2 % of range. Current must be measured through each jettison chamber using existing firing conductor and ground. To minimize the possibility of overheating the aircraft circuit, the load shall be applied by user utilizing a momentary switch, spring loaded to the off/unload position. 
RESPONSE #11: The government concurs with this clarification and will change the SOW accordingly. 
Section 3.3.5 requires a “commercially available” battery source with the capabilities of providing power for up to twelve (12) of operation continually. Current commercial grade batteries are operating in the 8-10 hour range without recharging. Any commercial battery that may need 12 hours of continuous operation may not be “cost effective” for this procurement. Is 8-10 hours of operation acceptable to the customer? The system will be able to recharge if needed.
RESPONSE #12: The government concurs with this comment; 8 to 10 hours of operation is acceptable. The SOW will be changed accordingly. 
Section 4.2.5, need this to be revised to reflect MIL-STD-461E. This is the latest mil standard and all of the labs are familiar with this standard. Within this standard, the test methods and test limits are included. If we were to use MIL-STD-461B, the end user will have to supply the test limits to which the unit will be tested. The 461E was written as an improvement over 461B and the test results will be more consistent.
RESPONSE #13: The government concurs with this clarification and will change the SOW accordingly.
Section 4.3 Performance Testing: This section(s) still call out the MIL-STD requirements that are in Section 2.1 and 2.2. Are these requirements for testing the commercial units applicable? 
RESPONSE #14: See Response #s 1 and 2.
**END**

WR-ALC/LUKB has a requirement for the modification of AMPTEC 630BN water-reistant igniter tester failsafe digital ohmmeter to perform in accordance with Statement of Work 06-LUHJ-0005. The modified AMPTEC 630 BN will be referred to as the Jettison System Support Equpment (JSSE).  The JSSE shall be a stand alone unit used to test the MH-53M auxiliary tank jettison system wiring and circuitry prior to installation of the jettison system explosive cartridges.  The JSSE shall be capable of verifying system ability to ignite explosive cartridges. The JSSE shall accurately measure ohms, volts and amperes.  These circuit testing modes will be used to indicate improper aircraft and pylon wiring, presence of circuit corrosion, loose wiring and connectors, high circuit resistance, circuit breakers ability to support an operational load, switch operations, stray voltages, and conditions which could make the system unreliable and unsafe for handling of explosive cartridges.  Requirement will require the testing of a prototype tester before producing an additional 8 testers.

This announcement will remain open until 10 November 2006 or until replaced by a successor BAA.  Proposals may be submitted any time during this period and must be received no later than 10 November 2006.

The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) reserves the right to select and fund for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  USSOCOM provides no funding for reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of USSOCOM to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.

USSOCOM is interested in receiving proposals for Science & Technology (S&T) Initiatives, which offer potential for advancement and improvement of USSOCOM’s intelligence and information operations capability including psychological operations.   USSOCOM’s is interested in funding research across a spectrum of science and engineering disciplines which have applicability to the production, distribution, and dissemination of information to mass markets including those over long distances.  Specifically, USSOCOM is interested in, but not limited to, the following technical areas:  Embedded Metadata – Enhanced Archive Storage/Retrieval, Enhanced Editing Technology; Blue Light Storage – Laser Technology For Enhanced Higher- Volume Storage Over Current Media; Standardized Formats – Eliminate File Conversion; Data Compression Capability Technology – Improved Bandwidth Usage; Virtual Studio Technology – 3D Graphics & Virtual Set Software Tools; Automated Data Archive Technology; Standardization Of  Deployable Production & Electronic News Gathering Capability Technology; Video & Audio Studio Modernization Technologies; Video & Audio Processing Enhancement Technologies, Enhanced/Improved Efficiency for Broadcast Transmitters, and Enhanced/Improved Efficiency for Broadcast Antennas.  The technology will be characterized, vetted in experiments and demonstrations, and in user exercises. Residual operational prototypes are then made available for future employment consideration.

The objective of this BAA is to provide USSOCOM a capability to produce, distribute and disseminate information. It is not the intent of this solicitation to establish new facilities, rather, to identify institutions that have demonstrated integration and development capabilities and have the necessary facilities to meet the objectives described.

Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selection. 

All are invited to submit a project proposal not exceeding 25 pages of text that describes the following:
1) The development and integration objective,
2) The development approach, 
3) Related work by the investigator or offeror, 
4) Anticipated contributions to USSOCOM programs, 
5) An estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for up to a three year effort, 
6) Proposed payment milestones and program schedule, and 
7) A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) appended with any supporting information, such as reprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal submission.

Additionally, all offerors must identify any rights and restrictions that exist on their technical data, and all offerors are advised that restrictions on technology transfers outside of the U.S. will be imposed on all media created in accordance with this BAA.  All offerors must also state if a technology they plan to respond to in this BAA is currently transferred to other countries / corporations outside the U.S.  Proposals must be submitted electronically to USSOCOM SOAL-KBC, 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL 33621 (Attn.: Mr. E. J. More, Contracting Officer, to moree@socom.mil.


It is desired that such technologies be: 1) deployable (ruggedized, robust in construction or packaging) from air-platforms, air-droppable, 2) low power requirements, 3) lightweight, 4) able to withstand a variety of environmental conditions and temperatures, and 5) trackable.


EVALUATION CRITERIA:

Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a scientific review.  By submitting a proposal, offerors agree that one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject matter- expert technical consultants.  Evaluations will be conducted using the following evaluation criteria EVALUATION CRITERIA: 1) Practical application and operational technical merits of the proposed technology, 2) Demonstration of current emerging development model device, 3) Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support and conduct the integration, demonstrations, training, and deployment of systems and supporting architectures 4) Relevance of the proposed technology application to USSOCOM program priorities, 5) Realism of the proposed costs. Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal in accordance with FAR 6.102(d)(2) as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists. 


AWARD INFORMATION:

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by USSOCOM. Small businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for small business due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.

The government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the parts of a proposal from proposal respondents. Proposals may be selected and/or award decisions made without discussions or negotiations.  The amount and period of performance of each selected proposal will vary depending on the research area and the technical approach to be pursued by the selected offeror. In general the basic time frame for period of performance is no more than 12 months. However in some cases a proposed project may require longer than 12 months to complete. For those proposed efforts that take longer than 12 months, a phased execution plan must be provided such that no phase takes longer than 12 months and all of the phases taken together take no longer than 36 months. Each phase must begin and end at logical, reasonable start and stop points in the total effort. For proposals requiring longer than 12 months for a period of performance only that effort that can be accomplished in less than 12 months will be initially funded. Follow-on effort (phases) will be treated as options.  The government reserves the right to fund some, all or none of these options.

<DESC>1.  Question: Drawing 8828098, Chamber Gauge, is referenced, but not included in the M1040 TDP. Answer: Drawing 8828098 and associated drawings are available upon request.  Interested parties meeting the NTIB must contact this office for a copy. 2.  Question: Section 4.5.1 of DTL 13012536, there are several paragraphs regarding operations that occur at LAP regarding chamber gauge evaluations.  Within this paragraph, it states that after 50 consecutive successful chamber gauge evaluations, the chamber gauge evaluation can switch to a single evaluation position rather than the 4 stated orientations.  This conflicts with Drawing 13012520 that states that all cartridges must be evaluated in 4 positions in the chamber gauge.  QAP 13012520 also reinforces Drawing 13012520.  Which specification takes precedence in this case? Answer: DTL 13012536 takes precedence.  The QAP and drawing will be updated in the future.  The correct procedure is to switch to a single evaluation position after 50 consecutive successful evaluations of 4 positions. 3.  Question: Section 4.6.7 in DTL 13012536 gives requirements for strength of design (SOD) testing including the number of rounds tested at each temperature.  This conflicts with the requirements in Table II.  What is the correct number of rounds needed at the extreme temperature for SOD testing? Answer: There is a typographical error in the DTL.  It has been updated in the latest revision of the DTL, which is attached.  The correct quantity is 10 rounds at â€“46Â°C and 10 rounds at +63Â°C. 4.  Question: Section 4.6.7, Paragraph C of DTL 13012536 states than an underline camera shall be located approximately 420 meters from the muzzle (under line of fire) to capture obturation.  Please confirm 420 meters is the desired distance? Answer: The underline camera should be placed at 20 meters from the gun, not 420 meters. 5.  Question: Section 4.6.11.1 of DTL 13012536, reference is made to cold testing at â€“46Â°C in the first paragraph and -37Â°C in the final paragraph.  Which temperature is correct? Answer: The correct temperature is -46Â°C.  This has been updated in the latest revision of the DTL (attached). 6.  Question: In QAP 13012520, Part C of the inspection requirements (for Cartridge Drawing 13012520) shows major 116 as cartridge weight.  Is there a weight tolerance to meet? Answer: The current weight and tolerance are 23677.4g and standard deviation was 27.3g.  A statistical measurement for outliers will be taken of 100 cartridges during the LRP production run.  The TDP will be modified if necessary afterwards. 7.  Question: On Drawing 93430111, Liner, reference is made to Drawing 9282888, Additive Composition.  This drawing details the composition of the ablative paste that is applied to the linder and is not included I the current version of the TDP.  Please provide Drawing 9282888 at the revision level that is needed for this TDP. Answer: Drawing 9282888 is available upon request.  Interested parties meeting the NTIB must contact this office for a copy. 8.  In QAP 13012522, the following clarifications are required: 	 a.  Question: Tungsten Ball, CD 103, Crush Strength: Crush Strength lists a test report as the Inspection Method.  Drawing 13012528 requires 35,584 N but does not provide a sample size.  What is the sample size? Answer: A total of 10 balls are to be tested per each lot. 	b. Question: Obturator, CD 203, Interior Chamfer:  What is the Conformance Criteria and Inspection Method for the Interior Chamfers? Answer: This is a level II feature.  Inspection method is not specified. 	c. Question: Base, CD, 202, Rod threads-type:  What feature size is to be inspected (i.e. major, minor, pitch or all)? Answer: All features are to be inspected. 	d.  Question: Body, CD, 104, Circular runout of OD: The OD of the part does not have a runout requirement.  Can we assume this will not be a CD? Answer: The drawing will be adjusted to add the OD runout requirement.  This feature will be a CD. 	e.  Question: Cap, CD 201, Threads â€“ type:  What feature size is to be inspected (i.e. major, minor, pitch or all)? Answer: All features are to be inspected. 	f.  Question: Rod, CD 201, Threads â€“ type: What feature size is to be inspected (i.e. major, minor, pitch or all)? Answer: All features are to be inspected. 	g.  Question: Projectile, CD 110, Projectile Weight:  The weight is an advisory on the drawing, but the QAP in paragraph 502 contains a method for establishing a weight to ensure all parts are present.  Is this statistical method the acceptance criteria?  If so, is the mean +/-3 standard deviations? Answer: Correct, the weight measurement is the statistical acceptance criteria.  The QAP will be adjusted to the PQT weight +/- 3 standard deviations. 9.  Question: Order of precedence for the TDP drawing package provided with referenced RFP. The label of the disc reflects â€œDistribution C: Limited to US Government Agencies and their Contractorsâ€.  Drawings contained within that package have other distribution statements.  Does the statement on the individual drawings take precedence over the disc label? Answer: The label for the disc with the Distribution C takes precedence. 10.  Question: Please clarify that the solicitation is for a loaded case only, correct? Answer: Yes, the case would be loaded. 11.  Question: Paragraph 7.4.4 (page 20): contractor requests modifying the first sentence of this section from "The contractor shall provide the technical data maintenance for the M1040 Program on the Government furnished Technical Data Package (TDP)." to: "The contractor shall provide the technical data maintenance for the M1040 unique documentation on the Government furnished Technical Data Package (TDP)."  There are various documents within the TDP maintained by other contractors and/or the Government, are common parts or packaging documents maintained by other agencies, or are being maintained by us under other contracts.  As a result, maintenance for the entire TDP would be beyond the successful bidder's control.  Therefore, we propose limiting the TDP maintenance to the drawings provided in the enclosed table. Answer: TDP Maintenance is required for the entire TDP, whether unique or common components. Your company should be well aware of the method of TDP maintenance and Configuration Management procedures.  The PM-MAS CM Plan has been provided as guidance. 12.  Question:  Page 86, L.9 Submission of Proposals: General Instructions:  The wording implies that we send 4 large binders with Volumes 1, 3, and 4 (with no Volume 2, Price) and 1 large binder with price (Volume 1, 2, 3, and 4).  Reference page 87, Specific Instructions/Information the wording implies that we submit â€œseparate volumesâ€ If so, do we submit 4 sets of Volume 1, 3, and 4 (with no Volume 2, Price) and 1 set of Volumes 1, 2, 3, and 4? Answer:  Follow L.9 and send 4 binders with volumes 1, 3, and 4 (with no Volume 2, Price) and 1 binder with price (Volume 1, 2, 3, and 4). 13.  Question:  On page 88 of the RFP, the page limitations indicate that Volume 1: Technical has a total page limit of 90 pages consisting of: 	a. Management/Quality Assurance/Production (60 page limit) plus 	b. Production (30 page limit) However, on Line 3 of Page 89, the RFP states: â€œ1. Technical â€“ Volume 1: (60 page limit).â€  To ensure consistency throughout the document, we request that Line 3 of page 89 be revised to reflect that the Technical â€“ Volume 1 is limited to a total page limit of 90 pages. Answer: The total number pages for the Technical Volume to be submitted are 60 pages. 14 Question:  Request the Government make available any ballistic test results form which any evaluation of performance to the requirements can be performed. Answer: Ballistic test results are available upon request.  Interested parties meeting the NTIB must contact this office for a copy. 15.  Question:  In the TDP provided for subject RFP, Note 5 of Liner Drawing 9343011 refers to Federal Specification L-P-377C dated 23 March 1994.  That Spec was cancelled without a replacement.  We request the Government provide direction as to what requirement for polyester film will be incorporated. Answer:  Offerors are to produce to the requirements called out in drawing 9343011 and Federal Specification L-P-377C Type I.  A suitable replacement and/or revised drawing will be identified in the future. 16. Question: The following QAPs were not included with the Solicitation TDP.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  NUWC Division Newport on behalf of the Program Executive Office Littoral Mine Warfare – Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Afloat (PMS 480), Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC, is soliciting  sources interested in demonstrating an active swimmer detection sonar system for in-water test and evaluation in the July 2006 timeframe. The intent is to assess the current state-of-the-art of commercially available, off-the-shelf swimmer detection sonar systems (SDSS) to protect Navy assets afloat and waterside facilities from unauthorized incursions by divers, swimmers, and swimmer delivery vehicles.  The swimmer detection sonar system should be able to automatically detect, classify and track the aforementioned threats and be available for demonstration at a Navy test facility. This test and evaluation is meant for systems that already exist and are commercially available. Systems that are in development, are not fully functional or do not have automatic detection, classification and tracking capability will not be considered. The system should have a minimum diver alert range of 500 yards from the sonar head and operate at a frequency above the human audible range. Systems with multiple sonar heads or in-water components will also be considered.  At their own cost, interested vendors shall be responsible for providing a complete system for test and evaluation.  This system will include, but not be limited to, a sonar head(s), automated processing and classification capability equipment that can demonstrate the ability to automatically alert for the specified threat.  Interested vendors will be required to operate their systems.  It is anticipated that vendors will provide the necessary logistics to support installation and removal of their systems.  The government will provide the targets to execute the test scenarios and oversight of system performance during the entire test.  Participation in this event is strictly voluntary and shall be solely at the cost of the vendor.  The SDSS sonar head should be capable of operation while suspended from a vendor provided float system near a pier with a test facility where the display and signal processing electronics can be installed. 120 VAC 60Hz power will be available in the facility to power the SDSS.   Vendors will be required to sign a release indemnifying and holding the government harmless.  The Navy intends to select a limited number (<6) of swimmer detection sonar systems for test and evaluation in the July 2006 timeframe at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport.  Selection will be based on performance criteria identified above and in the SDSS Product Information form, found at the end of this descripton. The testing of the selected systems will take place over the period of several days and each system test will be conducted independently with a common set of environmental and test parameters to be provided prior to the test phase.  Vendors shall coordinate the installation and deployment of the SDSS at the test site with the government at least four weeks in advance. Interested vendors shall submit a one page (maximum) description of their swimmer detection sonar system and complete the attached SDSS Product Information Form. If desired, additional information, product brochures, or descriptive materials, may also be submitted in pdf file format as an attachment to the Product Description. All submissions, inquiries, comments, concerns and questions shall be directed to Mr. Jack Hughes via email at hughesjw@npt.nuwc.navy.mil. Responses are due no later than 4:00pm on May 22, 2006.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with L-I Standards & Technology, Inc. 209 High Street, New Windsor, MD 21776-0729 for a cryogenic radiometer cryostat to supplement the existing cryogenic radiometer used in NIST's High-Accuracy Laser Power and Energy Meter calibration service. The cryostat will be used to research and develop a new cryogenic radiometer with capabilities beyond NIST's current device, the Laser Optimized Cryogenic Radiometer (LOCR). The new cryogenic radiometer cryostat must be compatible with the current calibration system, including the electrical control systems, and size, weight, and performance constraints. Because NIST's Cambridge Research Incorporated (CRI) electrical system is proprietary, there is only one responsible source which can deliver the cryostat. The LOCR, a modified CryoradII, including its detector assembly and electrical control system, were built by CRI, but the rights to CRI's technology have since been sold to L-1 Standards and Technology Inc. Therefore, only L-1 can provide a device that is compatible with the existing proprietary system. The new cryostat must most importantly be compatible with NIST's existing vintage detector assembly and electronic control system. The device must also meet the following criterion: 
1. Liquid Nitrogen radiation shielding with a hold time greater than 16 hours; 
2. Liquid Helium radiation shielding with a hold time greater than 72 hours; 
3. Cryostat dimensions of approximately 30 cm in diameter and 70 cm in height; 
4. 2.75 inch CF flange with manually operated valve for cryostat evacuation; 
5. 4.5 inch CF flange for attaching an optical system to the cryostat; 
6. Internal wiring harness for use with NIST's vintage CRI receiver/heat sink assembly and CRI electronic control system.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Under $100,000). This synopsis is issued for information purposes. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with The Regents of the University of Colorado to expand the temperature range of its torsional crystal viscometers from 420 K to at least 600 K at sustained or improved accuracy of the viscosity measurements, to automate their operation under computer control for timely performance of the viscosity measurements and to advance the analysis of the measurement results by incorporating equivalent electrical circuit models of nonlinear resonators in the processing of the raw data measured with the viscometers. This requirement is a continuation of work begun in September 2005 to continue through April 30, 2007. This requirement involves research using Government owned equipment. The Experimental Properties of Fluids Group at NIST is the only laboratory in the world that operates piezoelectric torsional crystal viscometers for standard reference viscosity measurements of gases and liquids in wide ranges of pressure and temperature. The Experimental Properties of Fluids Group has been tasked by the U.S. Air Force, Office of Scientific Research and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory to measure the viscosity of jet fuels and rocket propellants. These tasks require an unusually broad and unique set of skills including the design and assembly of micromachined transducers, the conditioning and mounting of electrolytically purified piezoelectric quartz crystals as torsionally vibrating viscosity sensors, verification of their measurement sensitivity and performance, expertise in complex data acquisition electronics, the implementation of sophisticated data acquisition software using the LabView graphical programming language, and the NIST software package ODRPACK for nonlinear orthogonal distance regression analysis, and advanced knowledge of molecular momentum transfer processes in liquids and gases. The University of Colorado has the unique set of skills in microsystems design, broad expertise in complex electronics and piezoelectric transducers, sophisticated data acquisition programming and advanced molecular momentum transfer processes that is needed for this project.  No commercial vendor has been  located that offers such broad ranging services.

<DESC>NOTICE:  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the small business and socio-economic market for the type of work described herein.  The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified Small Business concerns capable of determining how hatchery domestication reduces fitness of naturally spawning salmon and identifying approaches to reduce these harmful effects. In the short term, the study will provide estimates of relative reproductive success of hatchery and wild lines in the wild, identify of key life history differences contributing to differences in viability between hatchery and wild fish, and estimate the risks to viability imposed by one generation of hatchery culture. In the longer term, it will provide quantitative estimates of hatchery effects on long-term population viability and will determine the best approach to managing hatchery populations to reduce domestication selection.  Deliverables will be: 1. Create two selected “segregated” lines representing extremes for run or spawn timing and one control “integrated” line of coho salmon to yield at least 120 total families  2. Track pedigrees of all wild fish returning to the weir using molecular genetic analysis to allow measurement of evolutionary processes in the wild “control” populations 3. Test whether individuals have responded to selection for run timing by comparing returning wild  and hatchery fish from each line; test response in correlated characters  4. Continue broodstock protocols (segregated and integrated) on returning and maturing F1 adults to allow trend analyses 5. Measure the relative reproductive success of fish of all three lines in a stream or spawning channel. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Western Region Acquisition Division (WRAD) will be awarded.   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Estimated cost is between $1 and 5 Million.  All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE PROCEDURES BASIS FOR AWARD. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15.101-2 as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, and the proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications and all other requirements of this solicitation. The Government intends to award without discussions; therefore, the each initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the contracting officer. UNREALISTIC PROPOSALS Offerors are advised that unrealistically low price, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement, or has made an incautious proposal. EVALUATION PROCEDURES The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process. Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability or unacceptability only and shall not be rated. Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors. Any offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal and who has been found to have an acceptable past performance will then have the proposal evaluated for the lowest price. FACTOR – 1 QUALITY CONTROL PLAN Technical acceptability will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. An offeror must provide a quality control plan that provides an explanation of their quality control procedures and techniques for the performance work statement.  FACTOR 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE.  Past Performance acceptability will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a “Neutral/Unknown Confidence” rating for past performance. In investigating relevant past performance, the Government will consider information in the offerors proposal and information obtained from other sources.  Other sources may include past and present customers and their employees, other Government agencies including state and local agencies, pre-award surveys, consumer protection agencies and better business bureaus, and others who may have useful information.  Factors such as customer satisfaction, timeliness, product quality, and similarity to the existing project will be taken into account.  To be acceptable, the proposal must provide sufficient information about the offerors performance record that the Government can determine that the offeror should be able to successfully perform the required effort.FACTOR 3 - PRICE.  The Government will perform a price analysis to determine the reasonableness of proposed price in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(B)(2).  The Government will utilize a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. Normally, adequate price competition establishes price reasonableness (see FAR 15.403-1(c)(1)). In addition the Government will utilize a comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for the same or similar items, if both the validity of the comparison and the reasonableness of the previous price(s) can be established. The proposed price between offers with substantially equal technical and past performance ratings shall be a major factor in the selection of a proposal for award. Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items (to include: 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans, FAR 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases); clause 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, clause 52.232-33 Mandatory information for electronic funds payment; clause 52.232-36 Payment by Third Party.

Award will be made to the responsible, lowest price technically acceptable offer on an all or none basis.  This will be the only notice of award.  No formal solicitation will be issued.

<DESC>This amendment provides for more detail to the original posting of the requirements on 28 April 2006.  Operation of the 47-foot Motor Lifeboat (MLB) creates noise environments that impede normal conversational voice. Crewmembers must alter normal routine, move close to each other and shout or yell in each other's ears to communicate. This altered routine in conjunction with yelling to communicate causes a fatiguing and potentially hazardous environment to work in. The boat’s coxswain, using installed communications equipment, can not, in all instances, communicate to land based stations; operational commanders; other boats; ships or aircraft while operating the boat throughout its designed operational parameters because of engine and weather induced noise.
All 47 foot MLB crewmembers must have the capability to communicate to one another during all aspects of missions assigned to this platform.  The boat’s coxswain must have the additional capability to communicate to land based stations; operational commanders; other boats; ships and aircraft that may be encountered in the performance of assigned missions.  The capability for all crewmembers shall be clear unimpeded normal conversational voice.  The crew communication system (CCS) must be able to be used throughout the entire vessel.  The 47 foot MLB CCS boat set consists of a base unit and equipment to support a minimum of 5 portable/remote wireless operator positions, a portable/remote unit charger, and the ability to interface with the installed VHF-FM radios at two steering stations.  Variations of this system may also be used for other aluminum boats within the United States Coast Guard inventory.  A boat set for other aluminum boats would consist of 2 portable/remote units and not require a base unit.  

Constraints:
Extreme Weather Conditions:  The CCS must be functional when exposed to temperatures between (0 - 120 degrees F) and high humidity (up to 99% non-condensing)

Interfaces to External Systems:  
The CCS must interface with the already installed radio equipment to allow the boat coxswain the ability to use a single headset and microphone for both systems.  The CCS must be able to be integrated with at least 2 separate radios.  Only one radio shall be connected to the system at any time. The system shall be capable of being connected to any of the following models of radios:

Motorola Spectra
Motorola Astro Spectra
Motorola Astro Spectra Plus 
Motorola XTL5000
Motorola Astro Saber R1, 
Motorola Astro XTS-3000R
Motorola Astro XTS-5000R

Concept of Operations:
The CCS will allow the crew of the 47 foot MLB to communicate with each other over the noise of the engine and the weather (wind, sea, rain, etc).  The CCS will be able to be used on both the open bridge and the enclosed bridge of the 47 foot MLB and will also allow the crew to communicate with each other during various routine boat evolutions (i.e., moorings, boat rounds, helo ops, gunnery exercises).  The coxswain shall also be able to use the CCS to communicate with other mariners and shore units via the MLB’s installed VHF-FM radios.  The CCS may be used aboard the 47 foot MLB in almost all Coast Guard operational missions, including, but not limited to the following Continuity of Operations, Ports Waterways Coastal Security  (PWCS), Search and Rescue (SAR), Law Enforcement (LE), Marine Environmental Protection (MEP), Disaster Response, and Defense Operations. The CCS shall not inhibit the crew’s ability to perform any mission.  It shall increase safety significantly, by improving internal crew communication.  The CCS shall transmit in an unlicensed frequency band as defined in 47CFR15 that does not interfere with the radio systems already installed aboard the 47 foot MLB. The CCS shall operate in all areas of the 47 foot MLB.  The CCS shall operate in a full duplex mode.  Each portable unit shall be capable of being operated without interference from others. All units shall be capable of simultaneous transmission and reception. The portable/remote unit shall provide a side tone.  The operator shall be able to hear his/her own transmission, to indicate that the transmission is being received by the base unit and being re-transmitted properly.  The CCS shall operate with a hands free open microphone.  A separate PTT button shall be provided on at least one of the five portable/remote units, to allow the operator using that portable/remote unit to key the attached radio.  When activated the VHF-FM PTT switch shall isolate/mute the microphone audio from the wireless communications systems.  One headset shall be configured to receive radio input to one ear and wireless communication system input to the other ear. The radio input shall be transmitted via the interface cable. The other headsets shall be configured for crew communications only.  The CCS shall be delivered with the interface cable required to connect to the radios as installed on the boat. The interface to the radios shall be available at each steering station.  The cable connection between the vessel’s radios and steering stations shall be equipped with a break free type of connector.  This connector shall break free of the vessel when extreme force is applied to it. The length of the cable connection shall be sufficient to allow the operator to use either steering station on the open bridge. The headset used for the CCS shall be compatible with the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH), Personal Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT), or Advance Combat Helmet (ACH) helmets.  The headset shall be capable of being used with or without the helmet.   The headset shall provide a minimum noise reduction rating (NRR) of 20 dBA. The headset shall provide the capability of hearing the outside environment via electronic amplification of outside sound.  Audio at the operator’s ear shall not exceed 84 dBa.  The connecting cable between the headset and the portable/remote unit shall incorporate a waterproof connector, allowing the headset to be disconnected from the portable/remote units while maintaining the waterproof integrity of both.  All controls shall be capable of being manipulated with a gloved hand.  The glove currently used in the field is similar to/or the same as the Tec-250 shell with the T5-40 liner as provided by: Manzella Products, Inc. of Buffalo, NY.  The portable/remote units shall include an on/off switch, with a protective guard to prevent accidental activation. The portable/remote unit shall be equipped with a volume control.  The control shall have sufficient resistance to prevent accidental activation due to shock and vibration.  MIL-STD-167-1 shall be used as a guide for shipboard vibration data.  The portable/remote unit shall be equipped with a microphone mute switch.  The microphone mute switch shall disable the microphone on the headset.  The portable/remote unit shall be equipped with a momentary PTT switch to allow the operator to activate the microphone when the microphone mute function is activated.  This control shall be readily accessible, such that there is no need for the operator to access the pocket of the survival vest to activate the PTT switch.  One portable/remote unit shall be equipped with a momentary PTT switch, which will activate the external radios as installed on the boat.  This control shall be readily accessible, such that there is no need for the operator to access the pocket of the survival vest..  This control shall be combined into the same unit as that for 3.9.4.  The portable/remote unit shall be sized to fit inside the large main pocket of the standard Coast Guard survival vest currently used/or similar to the model 217 as provided by:  Lifesaving Systems Corporation of Apollo Beach, FL. The base unit shall be no larger than 17 x 13 x 7 inches.  The weight of each portable/remote unit shall not exceed 2 pounds, including battery but excludes the headset. The weight of the base unit, excluding cables and antenna, shall not exceed 15 pounds. The portable/remote unit shall utilize an internal rechargeable battery pack.  The battery shall provide a minimum of 8 hours of use on a single charge, with a 100% duty cycle.  The remote unit shall provide a low battery audible warning at least one hour before the battery is about to be discharged to a level which will no longer power the unit.  The battery shall be capable of being recharged without removal from the portable/remote unit.  The charger(s) shall operate on standard 120 VAC 60 Hz power.  The base unit shall be powered by 12 to 24 VDC with a tolerance of +/-10%.  The base unit shall incorporate an internal rechargeable battery for stand alone operations.  The internal battery shall provide a minimum of 8 hours of operation.  The base unit shall automatically select the type of power available.  External 12 VDC shall be the default if both internal and external power is available.  The internal batteries shall be charged whenever the system is connected to external power.  No external charger shall be used. The CCS shall be designed to meet the following environmental requirements.  The CCS shall be fully operational in a 0 to +120 degrees F (-18 to +49 C) temperature range.  The CCS shall be capable of being stored in a non-operating state in temperature range of -26 to +131 degrees F (–32 to +55 C) without damage.  The Portable/Remote unit and headset, shall be waterproof to a depth of 20 feet; in saltwater; in an operational mode; without damage.  The CCS shall not utilize waterproof bags or pouches to meet this requirement.  The CCS shall withstand immersion for a minimum of 30 seconds and shall be held at a depth of 20 feet for 10 seconds.  The CCS shall be capable of withstanding a minimum of three such immersions without degradation.  MIL-STD-810F, method 512.4, procedure 1 shall be used as a guide for immersion.  The base unit shall be designed to meet the requirements for rain and blowing rain as specified in MIL-STD-810F method 506.4, procedure 1.  The CCS shall withstand the shock and vibration of the 47 foot MLB.  MIL-STD-167-1 shall be used as a guide for shipboard vibration data.  The CCS must be capable of being operated in a saltwater environment, including salt spray and salt fog.  Salt fog requirement set forth in MIL-STD-810F, method 509.4 shall be used as a guide.  The CCS shall be capable of being shipped via common carrier without special handling or packaging.  The system, including the batteries, shall not need to be classified as hazardous material per 49 CFR Part 173. In accordance with the CCS Project Management Plan, the CCS will be initially prototyped on a maximum of 5 boats and then, assuming a successful prototype, full production will begin to install the CCS aboard all 47 foot MLBs within the Coast Guard.

<CONTACT>Tammy Luke, Purchasing Agent, Phone 406-363-9306, Fax 406-363-9288, Email tluke@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>Solicitation RML-RFQ-6012 – Courier Services is amended as follows:

SCHEDULE:  DELETE: Any and all references to duties involving processing in-coming shipments, i.e. date stamping receipts and maintaining records; assist in the receipt and processing of incoming freight; be required to perform data input for received deliveries; and be responsible for unloading, unpacking, and stocking incoming general and scientific supplies in the Building 22 RML Stockroom; be required to use data entry for issue of consumable items using an automated warehouse database program and a handheld scanner. Reference to “be required to perform periodic physical inventory of consumable supplies” is DELETED; the reference to “assist RML staff with annual physical inventories” is changed to read “assist RML staff with annual and/or periodic physical inventories.”

FAR Clause 52.228-5 Insurance – Work on a Government Installation is hereby incorporated with recommended minimum general liability coverage of $1M.

During the site visit the following questions were asked and answered:

Q:  “What is the anticipated date of award?”
A:  Approximately within a week following closing, allowing for administrative matters such as getting CCR; if it’s a new vendor, getting ACH information and ORCA etc.

Q:  “How long does it normally take to do a background check?”
A:  Approximately a week or so.

Q:  “Will mail be distributed once or twice daily?
A:  At this time it is only once a day, but will most likely go to twice daily.

Q:  “What is involved in the preparation of mail?  Will the Courier Services also be required to pack boxes and prepare labels, etc?”
A:  No, the packages are already prepared by the folks in the labs, the Courier will only be responsible to get them to Bldg. 29 in time for pickup.

Q:  “When will the IRF be coming on line?”
A:  Not until the spring of 2007 so it may be a part of this requirement. [This is a slight deviation from what was said during the Site Visit as it was stated that the IRF would not be coming on line until the FALL of 2007 so would NOT be a part of this requirement.]

Q:  “What are the duty hours?”
A:  This question was incorrectly answered as 8:00 am to 4:30 PM.  The solicitation actually states 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM.

Q:  “Will time be allowed to train backup personnel?”  What if someone is out sick?”
A:  Yes, however you must identify any potential employees, whether they are full or part-time so the necessary clearances and identification can be obtained.  Any absence of an individual in excess of one day, you should bring in a backup.  You must always have adequate staff available to meet the requirements.

Q:  “How will the Courier Services know where the packages need to go?”
A:  Each package is labeled (by marker) with the name of the person, bldg and room number.

Q:   “In the introduction you said this contract is for courier services only, however, the statement of work specifies that the Courier will date stamp receipts and maintain records; shall be required to perform data input; and be responsible for unloading, unpacking and stocking incoming . . . . supplies etc..”
A:  This appears to be a conflict in the statement of work which requires clarification.  (See SCHEDULE above)  

Q:  Will forklift operation certification be an award factor?  
A:  No, if you do not have current certification to operate a forklift, you will BE certified by the NIH Safety Office.  You just won’t be allowed to use it until you have been certified. 

The Response Date is hereby extended to not later than 4:30 PM (MDST) 05/08/06.

<CONTACT>Frank.Flutter@va.gov
<DESC>1. Regarding the packaging requirement, amendment 005 states, "cartons shall be secured with gummed paper tape". Current and previous contracts allowed for the use of clear 2" Box Sealing Tape.  Please confirm our understanding that clear 2" Box Sealing Tape will be acceptable for future contracts. Answer: The use of clear 2" Box Sealing Tape will be acceptable for contracts awarded under this Request For Quote. 2. Recent contracts/delivery orders required minimum shipment quantities of 4200 each flags.  Will this requirement be imposed on future contracts?  This 4200 minimum quantity shipment, which constitutes a pup trailer load, helps reduce shipping costs. Answer: The only requirement is the timely delivery of the required number of flags specified in the awarded contract.  Shipping arrangements (other than FOB Destination) are left to the contractor. 3. A-A - 52696 Par. 2.1.6 and the synopsis/solicitation requires the use of 50/50 Cotton Polyester blend for all sewing.  Current contracts require Polyester sewing thread Type I or II, class 1 of MIL-DTL-32072.  Please confirm our understanding that the Polyester thread is acceptable.   Answer: The polyester thread can be used as well as the 50/50 Cotton Polyester blend. 4. Current contracts require the "white looper thread" in the 401 stitch always be on the white portion of the stripe.  This is contrary to the requirement stated in A-A 52696 which states" only the needle thread should be visible on the front side of the flag", Please confirm our understanding that when using the 401 stitch it is acceptable to have the white looper thread on the white portion of the stripe, including those on the front side of the flag.   Answer: The white looper thread in the 401 stitch shall always be on the back of the flag. 5. Please provide a complete list of documents for the synopsis/solicitation. Answer: The Department of Veterans Affairs is currently implementing a new electronic contracting system not yet completely compatible with FBO.  The amendments as presented on the FBO website are correct - i.e. five amendments.   6. According to A-A-52696, paragraph 2.1.6 only the needle thread should be visible on the front side of the flag.  Is this a 301 or 401 stitch? Answer: It is a 401 stitch. 7. Can the 401 stitch be used with the looper thread always on the white stripe?  Answer: Yes, on the back side 8. Section 2.1.3 of the commercial item description calls for a bleached two ply cotton yarn for embroidery yet the industry uses a different yarn for the embroidery on this product.   Answer: The commercial item description sentence in 2.1.3 Canton: "The thread used for embroidery shall be bleached two-ply cotton."  is deleted in its entirety and replaced with: The thread used for embroidery shall be: Front yarn face -30/2 ply - blended 50/50% -- polyester cotton - bleached white  Bobbin yarn- 40/2 ply -100% polyester -bleached white. 9. Section 2.16 specifies 50/50 poly cotton.  May 100% cotton be used?  Answer: No. 10. What is the number of stitch lines on the fly hem? The specification is silent other than the color of thread. Please refer to the drawing 5-1-45B. 11. Can the Fly be sewn in four rows of stitching (double needle with two passes) with a one inch Hem margin?  Answer: No. 12. The header is joined to the flag with a two needle lockstitch and normally edge stitched on the opposing side with a single needle lockstitch. Can the header be attached with a double needle and then edge stitched with the same double needle, resulting in 4 rows of stitching showing on the heading material? Answer: No.
