<DESC>All potential prime contractor offerors on the Langley Administrative, Media andProfessional Services (LAMPS) procurement are invited to participate in an "AdvisoryMulti-Step Process" (see FAR 15.202).  The purpose of this process is to allow NASA toreview potential offerors capabilities and provide advice on their potential to be viablecompetitors, which will help companies decide whether to propose as a prime contractorofferor or to participate as a subcontractor in their field(s) of specialty.  To enableNASA to provide this advice, the following information is required:1.	A list of all contracts held in the last three years with a value greater than orequal to $4M/yr. or with greater than or equal to 35 employees; for each contract pleaseprovide the dollar value per year, the number of employees, and a brief description ofthe work performed by your company.  Within each work description specifically identify(e.g., highlight) any work that is similar to the LAMPS work areas listed at the bottomof this notice.  Also, please note any areas of work that were performed bysubcontractors.  Note: for IDIQ contracts please provide the annual value of workactually performed as well as the IDIQ maximum value of the contract.2.	A list of all contracts held in the last three years, regardless of dollar valueor number of employees, that contain work matching one or more of the LAMPS work areaslisted below.  Provide all of the information requested in item #1 above for eachcontract.3.	Any additional information about your company and its corporate officers and/orowners not already covered above that would indicate experience in managing an effort ofsimilar size, content and complexity as LAMPS.Your response may be no more than ten pages long; a page is defined as one side of asheet, 8 and 1/2" x 11", with at least one inch margins on all sides, using not smallerthan 12 point type (including graphs, charts, tables, etc.).  Foldouts count as anequivalent number of 8 and 1/2" x 11" pages (for example, a 17" x 11" foldout would countas two pages). The metric standard format most closely approximating the describedstandard 8 and 1/2" x 11" size may also be used.  Any content in excess of ten pages willnot be considered.Once NASA has reviewed your response to this pre-solicitation notice you may be contactedfor clarifying information, and once any clarifying information is obtained NASA willissue a written opinion advising you as to your potential to be a viable competitor as aprime contractor.  Your input will be assessed using the following criteria:1.	Size: Has the potential offeror performed work of at least a somewhat similardollar value as LAMPS?;2.	Content: Has the potential offeror performed work in enough of the LAMPStechnical disciplines to reasonably be able to perform &gt;50% of the LAMPS effort withits own employees (and not subcontractors), as will be required of the prime contractorunder this 8(a) set-aside per the "Limitations on Subcontracting" clause (FAR 52.219-14);and3.	Complexity: Has the potential offeror performed efforts that include multipledisparate work disciplines and/or the management of multiple subcontractors?It is our intent to provide potential offerors with valuable feedback that will help themmake informed, rational business decisions with respect to the LAMPS procurement. However, notwithstanding the advice provided by the NASA in response to your submission,your firm may still participate in the resultant acquisition even if you are judged notlikely to be a viable competitor.Your submissions will be considered proprietary source selection information and will notbe released outside of the Government.

<DESC>NAVFAC ESC is interested seeking technologies and methodologies to demonstrate and validate an adhered PV system in Guam, in the laboratory and under real world conditions, and evaluating the durability of conventional PV panels for use under typhoon conditions. 

The following topics of interest should be addressed in the proposal:  (a) Identify a technology and methodology for achieving technical requirements. (b) The methodology should help identify cost saving opportunities for future systems (e.g., lower maintenance requirements).  (c) Industry standard practices should be complied with as much as practicable. New or modified standards may need to be created to improve upon the viability of the system, but costs should be considered.
 (d) Industry test standards should be used to the maximum extent possible.

Innovation is sought, in accordance with the above interest areas, in 
1) Field demonstration approach: time period; layout of PV panels and samples; variation in amount of adhesives used; # of PV samples; size of functional PV system; brands/types of PV panels;
2) Real-world weathering vs. lab accelerated weathering results and how to determine the risk of mass deploying functional systems as time goes by
3) Test approach for lab testing rigid PV panels to 200 mph

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Replacement pumps shall be Aurora or approved equal.  If submission is other than Aurora, contractor must submit technical specifications and drawings for review and approval prior to award to:<br><br>US Corps of Engineers<br>Attn: Cam Allen<br>223 North Third Street<br>Walla Walla, WA 99362<br>camilla.allen@usace.army.mil<br><br>Replacement pump and motor sets shall meet the following specifications:<br><br>Both shall be two-stage, horizontal split case centrifugal pumps. Both pumps shall be right hand rotation; impeller rotation shall be clockwise, as viewed from the drive end of the pump shaft, with suction on the right, and discharge on the left, and flow spiraling away from the drive end. <br><br>The casings shall have tapped and plugged holes for priming, vent and drain in each stage. Removal of the upper half of the casing must allow removal of the rotating element without disconnecting the suction or discharge piping. The bearing arms shall be cast integrally with the lower half of the casing to assure positive bearing alignment; bolt on bearing arms are unacceptable. Each bearing arm shall provide a reservoir area for accumulation of seepage and have drilled and tapped holes to direct seepage into floor drains (drain piping by the government). <br><br>The impellers shall be enclosed type, bronze, cast in one piece. All surfaces shall be machined smooth and be free of burrs, trimmings and irregularities. The impellers shall be dynamically balanced, and be secured to the shaft by a shaft key and locked in place by threaded shaft sleeves. <br><br>The shaft sleeves shall extend through the seal box area, and beyond the gland. They shall be sealed at the impeller hub by Buna-N O-rings to prevent pumped liquid from contacting the shaft. They shall be threaded securely in place, and designed to lock the impeller. <br><br>The pump shafts shall be one-piece, 316 stainless steel, finished and polished. The shaft shall be of sufficient strength and rigidity and the shortest practicable distance between bearings shall be used to keep deflection and vibration to a minimum. The maximum allowable deflection of the shaft is 0.002" at any point of operation on the pump curve.   <br><br>The pumps shall be supplied with single row inboard bearings primarily for radial loads and double row outboard bearings primarily for thrust loads.  Both bearings shall be re-greaseable ball bearings, designed for 250,000 hours average life, minimum.  Each bearing shall be mounted in a machined housing that is moisture and dust proof.  The housing shall have registered fits to assure alignment, pinned to prevent rotation, and bolted to the bearing arms. Each housing shall be supplied with a grease fitting and a plugged relief port. <br><br>Flexible couplings shall be provided to connect pump shafts to the motor shafts.  The couplings shall be of an all metal type with flexible rubber insert.  The entire rotating coupling element shall be enclosed by a coupling guard.<br><br>The pump casing shall be fitted with bronze wear rings to minimize abrasive and corrosive wear to the casing. The wearing rings shall be radial type, shall have a shoulder machined around the circumference to match a machined shoulder in the casing to provide two sealing faces and to locate the rings in the casing. Wear rings shall be pinned to the lower half of the casing to prevent rotation.  A spacer and spacer wear ring shall be included between the impellers. The spacer wear ring shall also be pinned to the lower half casing.   <br><br>A stuffing box shall be provided on each side of the pump casing, with sufficient area to accommodate either packing and lantern rings or mechanical seals. Each stuffing box shall have holes drilled, tapped, and plugged to accept flushing water connections. Stuffing boxes shall be fitted with either tungsten-carbide or silicon-carbide mechanical seals.  <br><br>Lower housing shall include integral suction and discharge flanges. Suction flanges shall be Class 125, and discharge flanges shall be Class 300 (pipe sizes shown in the table below). Horizontal and vertical offset between suction and discharge flanges shall be as shown in the table below. Flange to flange distance shall be as shown in the table below.  <br> <br>The motors shall be continuous duty, 480VAC, totally enclosed fan cooled (TEFC) premium efficiency electric motors. Service factor shall be 1.15. Motors shall be sized to no less than 110% shaft horsepower. Motor performance characteristics shall not exceed criteria listed below. <br><br>Each pump and motor set shall be supplied coupled and mounted to a solid base. The base shall be sufficiently rigid to support the pump and motor without the use of additional supports or members.<br><br>Set 1	Pump and motor	<br>	Flow @ 1750 RPM	1280 GPM<br>	TDH @ 1750 RPM	345' <br>	Suction Pipe Size	8"<br>	Discharge Pipe Size	6"<br>	Case Bore	17"<br>	Suction to Discharge Horizontal Offset (Centerline)	11"<br>	Suction to Discharge Vertical Offset (Centerline)	-2"<br>	Flange to Flange Distance	32-1/2"<br>	Motor Voltage	480 VAC<br>	Maximum Motor Current 	240 A<br><br>Set 2	Pump and motor	<br>	Flow @ 1750 RPM	320 GPM<br>	TDH @ 1750 RPM	383' <br>	Suction Pipe Size	4"<br>	Discharge Pipe Size	3"<br>	Case Bore	14"<br>	Suction to Discharge Horizontal Offset (Centerline)	6-3/4"<br>	Suction to Discharge Vertical Offset (Centerline)	- 1-1/2"<br>	Flange to Flange Distance	24-3/8"<br>	Motor Voltage	480 VAC<br>	Maximum Motor Current 	77 A<br><br>SCHEDULE<br><br>Delivery shall be completed no later than 90 days after receipt of the contract award.

<DESC>The purpose of this specification is to procure fusible disconnects with fuses, pump panels with soft start and circuit breakers, and timing control circuit components to upgrade pump controls and electrical protection at Big Flat HMU.<br><br>Installing fusible disconnects on the main power feed will allow the pump panels to be disconnected from the main feed.  These disconnects will allow for work on the de-energized equipment.  These disconnects will also lower the arc flash hazard for the pump controls to a Category "1" instead of a Category "Dangerous."  The installation of the components procured in this specification will be the responsibility of the Government.<br>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI) for the Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) Program
<SOLNBR>SMC-11-41
<RESPDATE>032111
<CONTACT>Don Ruffin, Program Manager, Phone 310.653.3905, Email don.ruffin@us.af.mil - Lorraine Lewis-Wilson, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 653-0920, Email lorraine.lewis-wilson@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>16a. Description:
<p>The Defense Weather Systems Directorate (DWSD) Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) program office, on behalf of the United States Air Force, is seeking information from companies who could provide a production capability of seven (7) space-based Radio Frequency (RF) beacons flight articles and one (1) Engineering Development Unit (EDU) for remote sensing of ionospheric scintillation and line-of-sight Total Electron Content (TEC), and the associated payload to space vehicle integration and test support, and an option for commercially priced controlled storage facilities needed for the program. The RF beacon flight article is defined as a standard RF beacon. The addition of the language "flight article" should not imply that we are requesting anything other than the standard RF beacon.</p>
<p>Measurements of signals transmitted by a RF beacon flight article can be used to measure ionospheric properties such as the TEC along the signal propagation path, amplitude and phase scintillation indices at the transmitted frequencies. The TEC observations can be ingested into global assimilative models to improve ionospheric specification, and the scintillation observations can be used to estimate ionosphere-induced degradation of communication/navigation signals across the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>16b. Purpose:</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes. The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on existing technologies, or existing technologies with possible minor modifications that can be used to meet the sensing capabilities described in paragraph 16d, incorporating the listed Government assumptions. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the Government is interested in estimated cost and schedule information for individual requirements defined in paragraph 16d.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI# SMC-11-41 is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. We are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer from any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>

<p>16d. Sensing Capability Information Sought:</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information that provides an approach/information concerning the design and manufacturing of the RF beacon flight articles that would enable transmissions in the following frequency bands:</p>
<p>&bull; Coherent continuous wave UHF (e.g., 400 MHz) signal<br />&bull; Coherent continuous wave L-band (e.g., 1067 MHz) signal<br />&bull; Coherent continuous wave S-band (&gt;2 GHz) signal</p>
<p>The Government is also interested in responses containing approaches/ideas/designs that might provide additional value that could include modulation of the continuous wave signals.</p>
<p>To mitigate interference issues with a potentially co-manifested radio occultation sensor, the L-band frequency should be selected to avoid the Global Navigation Satellite Signal (GNSS) bands (GPS, Galileo, GLONASS) and particular care should be taken in the instrument design to ensure that no spurious emissions in the GNSS bands exist. While this RFI is focused on a space-based transmitter, the Government understands that the capabilities of potential ground receivers are a factor in the RF beacon flight article design. Responses to this RFI should include a discussion of the assumptions made relative to the ground-based component of the transmitter-receiver system. Furthermore, the implications of any proposed waveforms on the complexity of the ground-based receiver systems required to exploit the transmitted signals should be discussed.</p>
<p>The Government is requesting responses from respondents with established manufacturing processes and equipment for producing the desired RF beacon flight articles. The Government is seeking responses that demonstrate technology and design maturity along with the associated manufacturing readiness. The respondent should provide Level II cost and delivery schedule estimates by fiscal year as well as their assumptions associated with providing:</p>
<p>&bull; Seven (7) RF beacon flight articles<br />&bull; One (1) Engineering Development Unit (EDU)<br />&bull; One (1) power and data interface simulator<br />&bull; Ground Support Equipment (GSE)<br />&bull; Space vehicle integration and test support<br />&bull; Controlled environment storage option - Priced by month<br />&bull; Packaging and shipping containers <br />&bull; Launch and early operations anomaly support</p>
<p>The required funding profile across the fiscal years involved to meet the program schedule should be provided.</p>
<p>The following Government assumptions should be used for cost and schedule estimation:</p>
<p>1. Cost/schedule estimate will be at 80% confidence level and responders may also include figures from various confidence levels, with appropriate justification;<br />2. Solutions will be low risk by using high TRL components (i.e. minimum of TRL 6), the Government is willing to assess lower TRL with appropriate justification;<br />3. No Government facilities or property will be provided;<br />4. Anticipated contract award during 4th quarter Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2012;<br />5. Sensor delivery dates: (a) Engineering Development Unit (EDU) 4th quarter GFY 2013; (b) First RF beacon flight article 1st quarter GFY 2014; (c) Remaining 6 RF beacon flight articles 2nd quarter GFY 2014;<br />6. Spacecraft integration/pre-launch support: through launch in 4th quarter GFY 2015;<br />7. Estimate storage option based on a monthly rate;<br />8. Costs should be broken out to the lowest level possible;<br />9. Program level costs will include Systems Engineering, Program Management, Design, Manufacturing, Integration, Assembly and Test support, etc;<br />10. For contract type recommendations see Section 5.</p>
<p>Again, these assumptions are given for cost estimation and planning purposes only and the Government is only seeking information for market research purposes.</p>
<p>In your approach/responses please include the following, as well:</p>
<p>&bull; Discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations<br />&bull; Information pertaining to utilization of small business subcontractor/s, if applicable.</p>
<p>16e. Desired Technical Goals:</p>
<p>The RF beacon flight article should have a reliability of 95% probability of success (Ps) for the 5-year mission life. The altitude of the spacecraft carrying the RF beacon flight article will be 840 km or less. The command interface to the host spacecraft will be RS422. Measurement goals for TEC and scintillation measurements are provided in the following bullets. Scintillation measurement goals apply at each of the RF beacon flight article frequencies.</p>
<p>&bull; Measurement: Slant Path TEC; Measurement Range: 0-1000 TEC; Measurement Accuracy: 0.01/3.0 TEC (relative/absolute); Absolute TEC measurements are to be considered an objective requirement.<br />&bull; Measurement: Scintillation Indices; Measurement Range: S4: 0-1.5 and &sigma;&phi;: 0-1 radians; Measurement Accuracy: S4: 0.05 and &sigma;&phi;: 0.05 radians</p>
<p>The Government is interested in limiting the size, weight and power (SWaP) of the RF beacon flight article as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; &lt;5.0 kg (electronics and antenna included)<br />&bull; &lt;14 W<br />&bull; Electronics volume &lt;15&times;8&times;6 cm</p>
<p>Responses that suggest excursions outside of the SWaP limits, or which do not fully meet the measurements goals, are still of interest, but should include discussions of the rationale and relevant technical trades involved.</p>
<p>16f. Sample Response Outline:</p>
<p>The following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and to structure the responses for ease of analysis by the Government. Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit.</p>
<p>Section 1 - Technological Alternatives</p>
<p>Briefly describe one or more technological alternatives, including the reliability, flight heritage and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives (3-5 pages per alternative).</p>
<p>Section 2 - Feasibility Assessment</p>
<p>Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks (1 page per alternative).</p>
<p>Section 3 - Cost and Schedule Estimates</p>
<p>Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is an 80% confidence estimate of cost and schedule risk. Responders may also include figures from various confidence levels, with appropriate justification (2-3 pages).<br />The assumptions in paragraph 16d may be used for cost and schedule estimation.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Corporate Expertise</p>
<p>Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and any other information you deem relevant. Responses from small and small disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.</p>
<p>Please describe current and relevant experience that relates to the purpose of this RFI, including management and operations approach, and any lessons learned (3-5 page count).</p>
<p>Section 5 - Additional Materials</p>
<p>Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussions you deem appropriate. Include any recommended structure of the requirements in the event the Government plans to issue an RFP. Also, current department policy requires the use of Fixed Price (FP) contracts to the maximum extent possible. Please include in your response how your company could accomplish this effort under a FFP contract and assess the challenges, constraints, and risks that could arise from this contract type.</p>

<DESC>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK FOR SUPPORT OF INCENTIVE AUCTIONS FOR CLEARING BROADCAST TV AND OTHER SPECTRUM
<p>1.0 Purpose. The FCC, by means of this Request for Information (RFI), seeks to obtain informed views and other feedback on the attached draft statement of work (SOW), as well as to identify potential issues raised by the document. The FCC also seeks to identify potential service providers and solutions. This RFI is for the purpose of conducting market research. Information obtained is for planning purposes only. The Government will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this RFI. This is not a synopsis for a Request for Proposal. The FCC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this document. This request updates and follows a similar request posted July 23, 2010 on FBO.</p>
<p>2.0 Background. The FCC contemplates the design and optional proof-of-concept of a competitive mechanism to provide an incentive for incumbents licensed to use certain electromagnetic spectrum to vacate that spectrum voluntarily, which will allow FCC to repack the spectrum in a technically feasible way to create a contiguous block (or blocks) of cleared spectrum, and then assign the cleared spectrum to new licensees according to an FCC-specified band plan. This will require investigation of auction designs that likely include the FCC serving as a market-designer/marketplace for two-sided exchanges ("double auctions") or operating a procurement-type auction to clear spectrum followed by a forward auction to assign new licenses. The FCC may also contract with the same contractor on an optional basis to support the agency in conducting the auctions as designed and to provide associated software license rights for prototype and production software for the agency. Performance requirements of any contract awarded will be consistent with enacted legislation and with contemporaneously developed regulations. A draft statement of work under which such services and items might be acquired is attached. The SOW is preceded by a brief background presentation on repurposing spectrum.</p>
<p>3.0 Information Sought. FCC seeks all informed views and other feedback on the attached draft SOW, as well as the identification of potential issues raised by the document. FCC also seeks information in response to the following specific questions and issues:</p>
<p>3.1 What additional or alternative principles should be incorporated under SOW 1) a) i) (and should any be removed or modified) and why?</p>
<p>3.2 The FCC seeks general suggestions for the market or mechanism design, proof of concept, concepts of operation, models, technologies, and devices (collectively, "the means") suited to achieve the objectives of the SOW, whether or not contemplated or implied by the SOW. If the respondent has specific recommendations as to the means and how they should be applied, those recommendations should be made explicit in the response to this RFI. <br />Please also identify any substantial additional costs or cost savings that would be involved in formulating and implementing alternative means or that would result in additional benefits through their adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>3.3 What software could or should be used, in whole or in part, in prototyping and production in connection with the auctions?</p>
<p>3.3.1 Is the software commercial, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), or non-commercial?<br />3.3.2 Is the identified software used primarily in Government applications and environments or commercial environments or both?<br />3.3.3 To what extent would presently available software need to be modified to suit the purposes of the FCC?<br />3.3.4 Is the software a nondevelopmental item (an item that has previously been developed for a government), and for whose benefit was it developed or used? <br />3.3.5 Will the software need to be first produced in performance of this contract entirely at Commission expense?<br /><br />3.4 What Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contract type or combination of contract types would be best suited to achieve the SOW as currently drafted and why? In answering this question, please identify aspects of the SOW that implicate necessary or desirable use of the contract type(s), including any of your firm's business characteristics or methods of operation that would favor selection of the contract type or types.</p>
<p>3.5 What information would your firm find essential to propose to provide the services and other items under each of the numbered tasks on a firm fixed price basis?</p>
<p>3.6 What information does your firm believe would need to be included in a solicitation to eliminate, so far as is possible, significant variation in bidding assumptions for making price estimates for services offered on a T&amp;M basis?</p>
<p>3.7 What performance metrics should be used to gauge the success of the contractor's provision of auction support services as identified in Task 3?</p>
<p>3.8 What cost, schedule, and performance metrics should be used to gauge the success of the contractor's provision of all tasks in the SOW?</p>
<p>3.9 Are there specific independent testing laboratories that are best suited for testing the Proof of Concept software identified under Task 2?</p>
<p>3.10 What types and sophistication of professionals and other personnel will be necessary to successfully perform the tasks in the SOW?</p>
<p>3.11 The FCC is willing to consider hosting the auction system on its own IT infrastructure or on the contractor's IT infrastructure. What are the advantages and disadvantages for the government of each approach?</p>
<p>3.12 What examples exist for conducting two-sided exchanges ("double auctions"), and how might the lessons from those examples be applied to the conduct of the contemplated auctions? What experience does your firm have in conducting two-sided exchanges ("double auctions"), and how is that experience germane to developing and conducting the contemplated auctions?</p>
<p>4.0 General Guidance for Submission. Respondents may submit or identify comments, ideas, answers, or issues that address all or any part of the SOW or the questions in section 3.0 above. Respondents should provide a clear statement of how each part of their submission addresses a specific question, issue, or requirement of the SOW in sufficient detail to allow the Government to evaluate the relevance and usefulness of the information submitted. While many of the Government's requirements in the SOW are stated in an imperative "shall" format, for purposes of this RFI, industry is requested to respond with all appropriate or useful information, even if the information suggests an alternative requirement or standard or suggests reconsideration of the requirement as stated.</p>
<p>5.0 Respondent should make submissions by e-mail to eproposals@fcc.gov including any questions regarding this RFI. Electronic attachments to the e-mail should be submitted in Microsoft Office 2003 (or later) productivity application formats, or any format that can be imported by Microsoft Office. Submissions must be disclosable to the public or the submitter should provide a summary statement that can be disclosed to the public with fuller supporting information that is clearly marked as restricted. The Government will use customary means to safeguard proprietary information, but only when such information is (1) clearly marked as proprietary, (2) is, in fact, information that could not have been obtained from another party or source, and (3) is otherwise deserving of such treatment under standards and processes described in the FOIA and E.O. 12600.

HDI 11-63 Content Development For Sharepoint

 Introduction:
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified GSA Schedule contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, understand GSA Schedule pricing and discount practices and other market information readily available.  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement for user experience program support Services.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  

 Background: 
The CDW is VHA's national data warehouse.   Key data from VHA's electronic health record data will be available in CDW for analysis and for supporting informatics.   In order for CDW to be successful, VHA needs a metadata portal to develop CDW content by VHA data stewards and other subject matter experts.   VA Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) Business Intelligence Service Line (BISL) staff installed out of the box SharePoint and they have made available this implementation for VHA staff to shape its content to meet VHA business needs.   Before VHA staff may add content, VHA needs a framework implemented in SharePoint that supports collaboration among VHA business units and BISL staff.  This includes developing work areas for subject matter experts and then information for general users of the CDW.  Eventually, business applications utilizing CDW data will use the SharePoint framework. 
Scope of Work: 
The purpose of this project is to enhance and manage SharePoint structure and organization in support in the development of content for the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) and support for the development of Web applications that utilize content from the CDW.  The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA) is implementing a broad data management strategy to support both informatics and analytics.  The CDW is the core data store for this strategy.   As VA adds more content to CDW, teams of VHA will staff will evaluate the content data models, make recommendations on comment and evaluate the content for data quality.   All this work will be recorded in a SharePoint site for both the working teams and eventually for all users of the CDW.  Collaboration functions both within the working teams and the larger VA community is essential for the data management success and will need to be included in the SharePoint content implementation.   VHA will develop applications utilizing CDW mature data and use SharePoint as the framework for managing the applications. 

Period of Performance:
The period of performance shall be one 12 month base period, plus one 12 month option period.

This will be an unrestricted sole source procurement. The extension will be issued to the current contractor, World Technical Services, Inc., PO box 33069 Fort Sill, Oklahoma 73503.  The contract type is a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) contract.  This extension to the current bridge contract will provide uninterrupted services to the Fort Sill Installation pending resolution of a protest.  This action is accomplished under authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling mission requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and is posted for five (23) calendar days.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this four-month period would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract is based on this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code remains 561210.   Written comments to this notice and detailed capabilities must be faxed to (580)442-3819, ATTN:  Angela Triplett.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO SOLICITAION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;The purpose of this Modification 56 is to obligate $153,600 in new funding for Option Period 3 in support of several Work Assignments issued to support the Office of Water's efforts related to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. These work assignments are as follows:<br />Work Assignment 3-101 which has an anticipated period of performance of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. This work assignment is currently funded to the amount of $602,951.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work Assignment 3-102 which has an anticipated period of performance of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. This work assignment is currently funded to the amount of $248,835.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work Assignment 3-103 which has an anticipated period of performance of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. This work assignment is currently funded to the amount of $855,539.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work Assignment 3-108 which has an anticipated period of performance of April 12, 2011 through December 31, 2011. This work assignment is currently funded to the amount of $858,600.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 3-101, the contractor will continue to provide support for technical and administrative tasks to inform and coordinate Regional and Headquarters policy development and decision-making on meeting the BA provisions of ARRA particularly in regard to requests for waivers from the requirements of section 1605. Efforts include:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &#61553; Collect and log all requests for waivers from the requirements of the Buy American provisions of the ARRA.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&#61553; Evaluate waiver requests related to the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater facilities to ensure waivers comply with applicable justifications.<br />&nbsp; &#61553; Evaluate construction cost estimates and develop detailed independent construction cost estimates as needed to evaluate waiver requests for the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater treatment facilities, including estimated costs for iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods. Compare project costs using goods manufactured in the US compared to foreign manufactured goods. <br />&nbsp; &#61553; Prepare a report on each waiver.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &#61553; Develop a tracking spreadsheet database documenting each waiver request.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Under WA 3-102, the contractor will continue to provide the technical and logistical assistance to support the EPA in achieving the goal, objectives and requirements of the ARRA provisions as to "Green Infrastructure." Efforts will revolve around the review of DWSRF project proposals received by the individual State for ARRA funding to determine whether those projects have a green component, and make recommendations for green practices that can be incorporated into the projects. The effort will include providing technical assistance to states and applicants in developing and reviewing the "business cases" that are submitted along with projects in support of considering them as green projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary focus is on the green aspects of drinking water infrastructure projects. The work is intended to supplement and be coordinated with EPA's efforts for the GPR through the CWSRF.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This work assignment will benefit the agency by advancing our goal of encouraging the development and implementation of projects that provide the social, health and environmental benefits to be derived from "environmentally green" projects under ARRA's Green Project Reserve (GPR).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Under WA 3-103, the contractor will continue to provide the expertise and support to assist EPA's effort to assure an effective, legal and appropriate expenditure of ARRA funds to achieve the objectives of the economic stimulus through significant program implementation and oversight. Support tasks include assisting in: tracking the program's implementation; reviewing EPA Regional ARRA implementation efforts; assisting and training EPA Regional Offices in the oversight of State ARRA programs; training and assisting States in implementing their ARRA program including tracking and providing technical assistance to applicants; developing information to assess the successful implementation of the program; and providing reports on achievements to senior EPA and Executive Branch officials, the U.S. Congress, the water industry and other stakeholders and the general public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Under WA 3-108, the contractor will study how State Revolving Fund (SRF) ARRA funds were spent with regards to disadvantaged communities. The study will examine the extent to which subsidy was preferentially awarded with regards to socioeconomic indicators, both in terms of the use of preferential interest rates and &lsquo;additional subsidization' in the form of grants or grant like instruments. Comparable analyses will be conducted for both the DWSRF and CWSRFs and, to the extent possible, will provide a basis of comparison with a previous study on historical use of subsidy by the CWSRF. The study will provide a basis for understanding how subsidy is used under provisions such as those included in ARRA so as to inform future policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p>DEFINITIONS</p>
<p><br />1. Type 1, Contract Special Training. Formal training of a one-time or limited nature<br />contracted with civilian industrial or educational institutions and includes commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) courses. It is (but not limited to) used to train selected personnel to operate and maintain new systems. Personnel in training are the initial cadre and instructors who, upon completion of type 1 training, return to their organization and develop courses.</p>
<p><br />APPENDIX B</p>
<p>Performance Plan (PP)</p>
<p><br />1.0. GENERAL:</p>
<p>1.1. This PP meets the requirements of AFI 63-124. It is the result of collaboration among the Multi-Functional Team responsible for AFSAT contract oversight (assigned AETC CONS/LGCI Contracting Officer and AFSAT Training Program Manager (TPM)) specific to this contracting effort. Its purpose is to identify the methods and procedures the US Government (USG) will use to insure delivery of the services identified in the performance work statement (PWS). This PP relies on the Contractor's Quality Control Program (QCP) to the maximum extent practicable. The Contractor's quality auditor will perform surveillance of all performance requirements in accordance with the Contractor's Quality Control Plan (QCP), which will encompass all performance requirements of the contract. The government will perform surveillance to the level necessary to insure the Contractor's QCP and methods of surveillance are sufficient to prevent tendering of non-conforming services. Minimum surveillance will consist of review of all student critiques, Periodic Inspection and 100% Inspection; however, the Government retains the rights listed in the services surveillance clause of this contract. Reviews disclosing actual or potential discrepancies will be followed by review of Contractor's metrics of inspection with further government surveillance as necessary.</p>
<p>1.2. The Service Summary (SS) identifies the major service requirements the USG is acquiring and provides a basis for measurement between actual Contractor performance and specific contract requirements. The TPM, in partnership with the Contractor, will verify adequacy of performance for the critical or major requirements using any of the quality assurance methods delineated in Attachment 2. The Government has the right to inspect all tasks, not just Performance Objective (PO) items.</p>
<p><br />PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE <br />PWS PARAGRAPH <br />PERFORMANCE THRESHOLD <br />Method of Inspection<br />SS PO-1. Contractor shall provide training which meets content and objectives.

<p>1.4. Non-Service Summary Items. The Government has the right to inspect all tasks within this PWS not just the Performance Objectives (POs) listed in the Service Summary (table above). All other tasks required under the PWS may be inspected on a random or periodic basis at a frequency determined by the Functional Commander/Functional Director (FC/FD), CO, and/or QAP per the Inspection of Services Clause in the contract.</p>
<p>2.0. RESPONSIBILITIES:</p>
<p>2.1. The ACO has overall responsibility for all aspects of the contract administration function and is the primary focal point for formal government/Contractor interface. The ACO delegates specific surveillance responsibilities and authorities, by formal letter, to the TPM who will act as the CO's quality assurance personnel (QAP). Additionally, the ACO ensures the Master PP is used or coordinates a PP through AETC CONS/LGCI and AETC CONS/Quality Assurance Program Coordinator (QAPC) for PCO approval. The ACO is the only government representative authorized to direct the Contractor.</p>
<p>2.2. The TPM/QAP is the USG's surveillance program focal point and assesses the Contractor's surveillance efforts. The TPM/QAP will review the Contractor's Quality Control Plan (QCP), advice the CO of QCP adequacy, and may revise the government surveillance plan accordingly. The TPM/QAP is also the focal point for changes to the PWS. All proposed changes are processed through the TPM/QAP for technical evaluation of the mission impact.</p>
<p>2.2.1. The ACO will generate a letter of corrective action (commonly known as Corrective Action Requests (CARs)) or other appropriate documentation, review the Contractor's action to correct the discrepancy and prevent its recurrence.</p>
<p>2.2.2. The TPM/QAP will maintain the ACO letters of appointment, PP (with attachments), current contract and PWS, and documentation of surveillance activity (a completed Performance Plan Checklist at Attachment 1). Copies of surveillance documentation will be forwarded to the ACO upon completion of the contract performance, or as otherwise requested by the ACO.</p>
<p>2.2.3. The TPM/QAP will evaluate adequacy of all elements of the Contractor's QCP.</p>
<p>2.2.4. The TPM/QAP will monitor and evaluate Contractor tasks and system compliance with PWS.</p>
<p>2.2.5. The TPM/QAP will initiate request for and evaluate adequacy of Contractor corrective actions.</p>
<p>2.2.6. The TPM/QAP will notify the ACO of any significant performance deficiencies.</p>
<p>2.2.7. The TPM/QAP will recommend improvements to the PP and PWS throughout the life of the contract.</p>

<p>3.2. Government Surveillance. The TPM/QAP will assess, document, and report Contractor's compliance in the technical areas. The TPM/QAP may request Contractor's surveillance reports, evaluate the effectiveness of the corrective actions taken, and recommend to the ACO re-performance or equitable adjustment for acceptance of non-conforming services. Should a discrepancy of performance be determined, the ACO will generate a CAR (or other appropriate documentation), to include the contract number, the PWS reference, a description of the discrepancy and an appropriate time frame for the Contractor to respond. The ACO will assure the Contractor's response includes documentation of how the discrepancy was corrected and what steps are taken to prevent the reoccurrence of the discrepancy. As appropriate, the ACO will support the Contractor to reconcile the processes used to deliver contractually accurate performance.</p>
<p>3.2.1. The intent of including the PP in the RFP is to gain confidence in the Contractor's business practices, and performance.

At any time the government feels a performance objective has not been met and the technical expertise of a special auditor may be required, the TPM/QAP may request ACO consideration of a special quality audit. <br />3.4. Certification of Services. At the end of each contract payment period as defined in the resulting award of this acquisition, the QAP shall certify the services were received in accordance with contract payment terms and conditions.</p>
<p>3.5. The MFT will continue to meet after award as necessary to ensure high levels of contractor performance, foster a synergistic partnership, and support mission requirements.</p>
<p>3.6. INITIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW (IPR). The initial evaluation of contractor performance shall take place within 30 days after the contractor assumes full performance responsibilities (i.e. after completion of transition/mobilization) to ensure the contractor has successfully started performance, completed transition, is fully operational, and is within the estimated cost, schedule, and performance parameters of the contract.</p>

<p>QUALITY ASSURANCE METHODS</p>
<p><br />OPERATIONAL ASSESSMENT: Risk-based assessment of major tests, critical operations, etc., and assessment of Contractor work processes/procedure compliance normally driven by developing trends.</p>
<p>MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ASSESSMENTS: System audits performed by a team of qualified Quality Assurance (QA) auditors to ensure existence of a documented quality assurance management system capable of delivering acceptable goods and services, and mitigating risks to customers.</p>
<p>PROCESS EVALUATIONS: Assigned Training Program Manager (TPM), working with Contractor personnel, determines if processes meet specifications and promote continuous improvement. Contractor metrics are validated.</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE HISTORY: Objective, historical documentation of Contractor performance to assist in the analysis of their past and present performance.</p>
<p>CUSTOMER COMPLAINT RESOLUTION: Actions taken in support of a specific Contractor or government concern or problem that impacts operations. Usually results in Government-to-Contractor or Contractor-to-Contractor process deficiency resolution (feedback). NOTE: Customer complaints, once validated, are a means of surveillance and are alternative to formal surveillance methods.</p>
<p>CUSTOMER FEEDBACK (Student Critiques): Student evaluations of training assist in the analysis of Contractor's performance under contract. If critiques are unfavorable, the areas in question may require further evaluation using any of the QA methods herein.</p>
<p>TPM VALIDATION: Reviews, or other actions taken by the TPM, including the use of the Performance Plan (PP) Checklist, to insure receipt and compliance.</p>
<p>100% INSPECTION: The QAP/TPM will inspect and evaluate the contractor's performance each and every instance they are performed. The QAP will determine acceptability and compliance with the performance threshold by monitoring and tracking each deliverable service/document. Technical documents and other deliverable documents will be reviewed for technical accuracy and compliance with technical directives. The results of this inspection may be used as the basis for actions toward the contractor.</p>
<p>PERIODIC INSPECTION: These services are inspected using periodic or recurring basis. Periodic surveillance may be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc. The results of periodic surveillance inspection may be used as the basis for actions (other than payment deductions) towards the service provider. In such cases, the Inspection of Services clause becomes the basis for the Contracting Officer's actions.</p>

CDC collaborates with U.S. government PEPFAR partners, host governments, Ministries of Health, non-governmental organizations, U.S.-based universities, and the private sector to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>To better understand the relationships among populations, HIV prevalence, and existing services, CDC:<br />Builds in-country capacity to design, implement, and evaluate HIV/AIDS-related surveillance systems and surveys; and assists and trains countries on how to analyze, disseminate, and use HIV/AIDS data. <br />Develops tools, guidelines, recommendations, and policies to translate research for improved planning and program implementation. <br />Evaluates and implements novel approaches for conducting surveillance and surveys.</p>
<p>Considering the well reported importance of monitoring the epidemics and the behavior of most at risk populations (MARPs) for HIV, the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA (INLS) has requested assistance in conducting behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) in Angola with MARPs. <br />Based on the results of a qualitative assessment with most at risk populations in the provinces of Luanda and Cunene, it was recommended that BSS to be conducted with men who have sex with men (MSM) in Luanda, long distance truck drivers in both Luanda and Cunene provinces, and young women involved in transactional sex in the border region of Cunene. <br />Although no serological data is available for truck drivers in Angola, several studies have identified them as a vulnerable population for acquiring and transmitting STI (sexually transmitted infections), including HIV, in different locations throughout the world. HIV risk in this population is driven by the mobile nature of their work, which makes them move away from protective social networks, including family and broader communities, and may result in greater exposure to risky behaviors while traveling (Lippman et al., 2007). Following Angola's civil war, the borders of neighboring countries opened, allowing greater mobility to and from neighbor countries with generalized HIV epidemics. As a result, long distance truck drivers have become an important population for acquiring and transmitting STI/HIV.</p>
<p>2 Project Objectives</p>
<p>To assist the CDC in conjunction with the Government of Angola in understanding the HIV epidemic among long distance truck drivers, CDC will support a behavioral and serological surveillance (BSS) baseline survey for the targeted population.</p>
<p>The objectives of the survey are:</p>
<p>1) Examine attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of risk related to HIV and STD among truck drivers;<br />2) Estimate HIV and syphilis prevalence among truck drivers; and <br />3) Develop capacity within the Ministry of Health to implement subsequent BSS surveys among most at risk populations for HIV.</p>
<p>This information collected will be used by the CDC to develop and improve HIV prevention and care programs for the target population.<br /><br />3 Scope of Work</p>
<p>BSS will include an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire along with biological testing for syphilis and HIV.</p>
<p>Phase 1: Protocol Development,</p>
<p>&bull; Develop a comprehensive, cross-cutting protocol that includes behavioral and serologic data collection among long distance truck drivers and their assistants in Luanda and Cunene. <br />&bull; Obtain required Institutional Review Board approvals or exemptions.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Surgical Sponges. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>Vendor is not required to quote for each MMESO AOR. Vendor will be required to identify in initial response for which MMESO AOR(s) they intend to submit quotes. The Government will make a single selection for each of the following MMESO AORs:</strong>
<p><strong>1. MMESO North</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. MMESO South</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. MMESO West</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. MMESO Pacific</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. MMESO Europe</strong></p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR) for which a quote is submitted, i.e., Cardinal Health and/or Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. <strong>Point of Contact: Ricardo Orias,MMESO West Team Leader, </strong><a href="mailto:Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619)532-8537"><strong>Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619)532-8537</strong></a><strong> ;&nbsp;Cindy Ingrao, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cynthia.ingrao.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619)532-8517;Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Sponges. Within The MMESO West estimated total annual demand for this product line is approximately $1,274,582.00 based on PV usage data over 12 months of recent usage. Estimated annual demand per Area of Responsibility is approximately MMESO North: $148,303; MMESO South: $641,970; MMESO West: $185,503; MMESO Europe: $161,543; and MMESO Pacific: $137,263. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top thirty-nine (39) lines items of the total one hundred fifty four (154) line items, account for 75.2% ($958,610) of the total volume in sales ($1,274,582) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 39 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide <strong>an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, Ms. Cindy Ingrao, Clinical Analyst, cynthia.ingrao.ctr.@med.navy.mil and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address);&nbsp;(3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding; and (4) Identification of which MMESO AOR(s) vendor intends to submit pricing for. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendors who do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFIAQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for each MMESO AOR based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendors must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Vendors who do not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. The vendors who meet the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The four (4) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br />1. Vendor MUST provide a line of Surgical Sponges products that includes at a minimum the specific products identified below for Surgical Sponges: sterile, woven, latex free, and contain an integrated radiopaque indicator, and will include at a minimum:<br />a. <br />GAUZE SPONGE, X-RAY DETECTABLE, 4" X 8", 12 PLY, STERILE<br />K DISSECTOR SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 1 1/4 X 9/16 IN, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 4x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 18x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE<br />NEURO PATTIE, X-RAY DETECTABLE, 1/2 X 3 IN, STERILE, W/STRING<br />NEURO SPONGE STRIP, XRAY DETECTABLE, 1/2 X 1/2 IN, STERILE, W/STRING<br />ENDOSCOPIC PEANUT SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 5MM, STERILE<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Surgical Sponges.</p>
<p>b. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufacture and/or distribute by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFAIQ with initial submittal. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as stated above will be disqualified in Phase I).<br />2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Surgical Sponges product line. Vendor MUST provide the DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal. Vendors without a DAPA number or those that have not applied for a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />3. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Medical/Surgical prime vendors for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e. Cardinal Health and/or Owens &amp; Minor for Surgical Sponges or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. Vendors whose products are not available through the Prime Vendors or who have not applied for PV distribution will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />4. Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for the products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.)<br />5. Vendor must identify with initial submittal which MMESO AOR(s) they intend to submit quotes for. Vendor will not have an opportunity to change MMESO AOR(s) during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Evaluation <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO West, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. <strong>Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples.</span> This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). Two (2) packages of each size and configuration listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>GAUZE SPONGE, X-RAY DETECTABLE, 4" X 8", 12 PLY, STERILE<br />K DISSECTOR SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 1 1/4 X 9/16 IN, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 4x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 18x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE<br />NEURO PATTIE, X-RAY DETECTABLE, 1/2 X 3 IN, STERILE, W/STRING<br />NEURO SPONGE STRIP, XRAY DETECTABLE, 1/2 X 1/2 IN, STERILE, W/STRING<br />ENDOSCOPIC PEANUT SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 5MM, STERILE</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate product samples from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)- Completely Unacceptable, two (2)- Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)- Partially Unacceptable, four (4)- Acceptable, and five (5)- Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately nineteen (19) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. The surgical sponge does not lint/release fragments of material. (Patient Safety - NPSG #7 - 07.05.01)<br />2. The surgical sponge is composed of a soft and absorbable material. (Patient Safety/Comfort - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />3. The radiopaque material is attached securely to the sponge and is readily visible to the eye.(Patient Safety - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />4. The surgical sponge is durable and does not fray. (Patient Safety - NPSG-7.05.01)<br />5. Any color or dyed part of the surgical sponge does not come off on your gloved hand when the sponge is wet or dry. (Patient Safety - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />6. The package is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field. (Patient Safety and Efficiency of Usage)</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00 PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. <strong>Vendor quotes will contain separate pricing for each MMESO AOR(s) that were identified in Technical Requirements, above. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR.</strong> The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) 11-233-SOL-00022. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-46.  This requirement is a total small business set aside. The NAICS code is 541860 Direct Mail Advertising with a small business size standard of $7.0 million dollars.  The due date for receipt of proposals is NLT 1:00 PM EST December 17, 2010.  Proposals shall be submitted electronically to Mr. Gabriel Wright at Gabriel.Wright@psc.hhs.gov.  

1.	Background

The Federal Offset Program is a government-wide delinquent debt matching and payment offset system.  It is a means of offsetting Federal payments due the delinquent debtor from the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program and the Administrative Offset Program.  It is a cooperative effort between the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS).  The Program refers the names of non-custodial parents who are past due in their child support obligations to FMS to offset payments being refunded to delinquent obligors.

One of the functions OCSE performs is the production of a pre-offset notice to be sent to those individuals who have been submitted for potential administrative and/or tax refund offset. This notice, mailed in double window envelopes to the delinquent debtor at the address used to file his/her last year's tax return or the most current address on file at the State and submitted to OCSE, may be sent by either OCSE or the IV-D agency at the State's option.  (Currently 25 States and/or jurisdictions elected to have OCSE send their pre-offset notices.)  These pre-offset notices will be mailed to delinquent debtors and inform the individual of the amount of support claimed to be past due. New cases may be added to the program throughout the year with a corresponding pre-offset notice being issued to the non-custodial parent.  The pre-offset notice informs the individual of the amount of support claimed to be past due, provides a State or local contact address and phone number to whom the obligor may submit any objections regarding the proposed administrative and/or tax refund offset.

2.	Project Objective

The objective of this contract is to perform all steps necessary to complete the timely printing and mailing of all OCSE issued pre-offset notices within one week of receipt. Only new cases require pre-offset notices be mailed to the non-custodial parent. States may also request that additional pre-offset notices be issued to an obligor as needed.  The contract will be structured to provide for a base year and four option periods (five-year contract total) consistent with the current contract structure.

3.	Statement of Work and Detailed Technical Requirements

The contractor must have on site computer capability to use Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS) or a similar system to read and process CD-ROM data provided by OCSE containing the nine-digit Postal Service Information to assist the contractor in sorting the cases for mailing.  The contractor's computer system must be certified by the Postal Service in order to attain a lower postage mailing rate which would result in significant cost savings to both State and Federal governments.  The contractor must be able to include appropriate postal bar codes on each notice.  It is estimated that the number of notices will not exceed 3.5 million but could be as low as 1.5 million per year based on current legislative requirements.  However, should there be future legislative changes, the amount per year may exceed 3.5 million.
 
The contractor will be required to purchase and store envelopes to complete deliveries 1 to 2 months before work starts.  In addition, any leftover envelopes must be stored until the contract period is over at which time the envelopes will be stored at contractor's facility.  It would be the responsibility of the new contractor to transport the unused envelopes to their warehouse immediately after the expiration of the current contract.  Consequently, this could involve moving and storing from 200,000 to 3.5 million envelopes depending on the time of the year.

The steps to be completed:

	file conversion and CASS certifying addresses

	print pre-offset notices

	burst and trim the notices;

	fold, stuff, and seal the notices into the double window envelopes with indicia provided by the Government;

	compare machine counts of notices ready for mail with the counts on the disk supplied by OCSE

	within 5 business days of delivery of file from OCSE, print, insert and deliver the mail to the local mass mailing center and have the postal service complete the appropriate USPS Form;

	keep OCSE informed on a daily basis of status of all processing and mailing orally and/or in writing; and

	reprint damaged notices

	purchase and store envelopes on site from the time of delivery for use throughout the year.

All appropriate Federal regulations regarding the handling and safeguarding of tax information will be strictly observed and enforced (see IRS Publication 1075).

4.  General Requirements and Deliverables:

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, and supplies (except as otherwise, specified herein) and perform the work set forth below.

The contractor must establish written safeguards for the transportation, processing, and storage of the tax information in conformance with section 6103(p)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).  Only authorized employees will be permitted to handle the notices.  All affected employees of the contractor will receive, read, understand, and follow the procedures as delineated in IRS Publication 1075 (Tax Information Security Guidelines).

Printing of the notices will commence on January 25, 2011 (approximately) at the rate of approximately 37,000 per week and mailing will start on a weekly basis beginning on or around January 28, 2011.  The contractor will be required to mail pre-offset notices throughout the year for new and existing cases (the contractor will be provided with the new cases on a weekly basis).  

The pre-offset notice is currently a one page notice with the name and address of the non-custodial parent as the addressee and the State or local Child support office as the return address on the first page.  However, the contractor must be able to print, insert and mail multiple-page notices, as well as different notice formats if required.  Care must be taken when printing, trimming, bursting, folding, sealing and mailing the notice so that the page(s) will align properly, thus reducing the number of damaged pre-offset notices.

The pre-offset notices will be processed in sequence.  The notices will be inspected to ensure that composition and alignment are correct to allow for efficient processing.  Notices will be printed, burst, trimmed, and folded so the appropriate name and address of the noncustodial parent and the return address show through the windows of the double window envelopes and then the notice should be stuffed in the envelope.  The envelope must then be sealed and ready for mailing.  The count of the number of notices put through the mailing machine must be compared with the count of the number of notices printed.  The counts must agree.  If they do not, they must be rectified immediately (differences should be attributed to damaged notices only).

Any notices damaged during processing will be reprinted, inserted and mailed within 2 business days of such damage.  The contractor must constantly observe the processing of the notices and immediately stop the processing when damaged or mutilated notices occur, thus minimizing the number of notices that must be reprinted and processed.  

 The contractor will have USPS Form 3606 (Sender's Statement for Foreign Mail) or USPS Form 3600-R (Statement of Mailing) signed by the post office when verifying the mail.  These forms will be sent to OCSE immediately after the mailing occurs.  These forms will be part of the reconciliation process. 

Prior to award the prospective contractor must be available to conduct a test of all machines which will actually be used to process the pre-offset notices.  At least 1,000 notices, divided equally among all machines to be used, must be included in the test run. The run should include each phase of the process except the actual mailing.  The contractor will also be required to conduct annual tests of at least 1,000 notices if deemed necessary by OCSE.

The contractor must describe exactly how it will fix mechanical or other problems that come up during processing.  This is to include whether or not back-up machines will be used, and if not, whether a subcontractor will be engaged to perform the work.  If this is the case, the subcontractor's name, address, telephone number, and experience with this type of work must be specified. Also, the capacity in terms of the amount of work the subcontractor is capable of handling within a 24 hour period must be described.  All security considerations attendant to the transport to the subcontractor, and the subcontractor's processing and storage of the information must be described in the written security guidelines.  If a repair shop is to be called upon to fix the machines, the name, address, telephone number of the repair shop must be specified.

Also to be specified is the time frame after the problem occurs in which the repair shop will be called and the problem will be fixed.  The contractor is required to carry an appropriate level of Errors and Omissions Insurance Coverage and provide a Certificate of Insurance copy.  OCSE must be immediately notified of any problems that do occur, and be kept continually informed of what actions are being taken to remedy such problems and the progress of these actions.

The contractor must allow OCSE to inspect the work site, as it deems necessary.

52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

	Quotations will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth below to determine the vendors demonstrated ability to provide the required goods/services.  Quotations must be specific and compliant with all terms and conditions of the solicitation in order to be acceptable.  The vendor shall clearly and completely address the factors as required by the solicitation.  Any quotation failing to address all of the elements of the solicitation factors will be considered an indication of the vendors lack of understanding of, and response to, the Governments requirements and may result negatively in overall quotation evaluation.

Factors are listed in descending order of importance

Security and Storage

The vendors quote shall demonstrate the vendors process for ensuring that the mail distribution adheres the regulations set forth in the IRS Publication 1075 Tax Information Security Guidelines for Federal, State and Local Agencies.  

Technical Approach

The vendors quote shall demonstrate the vendors ability  to handle high volume mail processing.  The contractor shall describe their ability to accurately process mail utilizing Coding Accuracy Support Systems and other business practices to ensure accurate delivery and processing of mail. 

Past Performance

Past Performance of Similar Tasks  Please provide at least 3 but no more than 5 references of similar efforts by your organization for the last three years for performing high volume mailing services for Federal, State or Local governments.  

The Government may also consider information obtained through other sources.  Past Performance information will be utilized to determine the quality of the contractors past performance as it relates to the probability of success of the required effort.

If the vendor does not have any past performance references, then the contractor will be evaluated by neutral.   (References will be checked)

Price 

Contract award shall be made to the responsible vendor whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provide the overall best value to the Government, past performance, technical factors, and price considered. A vendors quote may not be considered when the proposed price is unreasonably high or unrealistically low. In the event quotes are evaluated as technically equal in quality, price will become a major consideration in selecting the successful vendor Vendors will also be evaluated for appropriate labor mixes and price reasonableness.

HHS intends to award without discussions; however, HHS reserves the right to hold discussions if required.  Accordingly, each initial quotation should be submitted on the most favorable price and technical terms that the vendor can submit to HHS.  


Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jun 2008)</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>Evaluation is based on the following criteria in descending order of importance:<br /><br />1. Price<br />2. Delivery<br />3. Past Performance (Relevant and recent)</p>
<p>Price is the most important evaluation factor, with Delivery being the second most important evaluation factor. Price and Delivery, when combined, are more important than Past Performance.</p>
<p>Price:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide pricing for requirement listed in this solicitation. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section.</p>
<p>Delivery:</p>
<p>The offer must include information on lead time and F.O.B. information in accordance with the requirements in this solicitation. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date will be rated higher, with offerors that are able to deliver sooner than the required delivery date rated the highest.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past three (3) years. Relevant experience includes that which is similar in services provided. The following information shall be provided for each reference listed: Name of Contracting Activity, Contract Number, Contract Type, Contract Amount, Short Description of Work Performed, Contracting Officer and Telephone Number, Technical Point-of-Contact and Telephone Number. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated for relevancy and recency. More relevant past performance will be rated higher with more recent, relevant past performance rated the highest.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (APR 2011)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>(a) When authorized in writing by the cognizant Contract Administration Office (CAO), the Contractor shall ship with a Certificate of Conformance any supplies for which the contract would otherwise require inspection at source. In no case shall the Government's right to inspect supplies under the inspection provisions of this contract be prejudiced. Shipments of such supplies will not be made under this contract until use of the Certificate of Conformance has been authorized in writing by the CAO, or inspection and acceptance have occurred. <br />(b) The Contractor's signed certificate shall be attached to or included on the top copy of the inspection or receiving report distributed to the payment office or attached to the CAO copy when contract administration (Block 10 of the DD Form 250) is performed by the Defense Contract Administration Services. In addition, a copy of the signed certificate shall also be attached to or entered on copies of the inspection or receiving report accompanying the shipment. <br />(c) The Government has the right to reject defective supplies or services within a reasonable time after delivery by written notification to the Contractor. The Contractor shall in such event promptly replace, correct, or repair the rejected supplies or services at the Contractor's expense. <br />(d) The certificate shall read as follows:</p>
<p>I certify that on ______ [insert date], the ____ [insert Contractor's name] furnished the supplies or services called for by Contract No._____ via ____ [Carrier] on ________ [identify the bill of lading or shipping document] in accordance with all applicable requirements.

<p>Date of Execution: _____________________________ <br />Signature: _____________________________________ <br />Title: _________________________________________</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.211-8 Time of Delivery (JUNE 1997)(ALT. I, APR 1984) <br />The Government requires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:</p>
<p>REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE <br />All CLIN's are required 30 calendar days after the date of receipt for each individual purchase order</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate equally, as regards to time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above may be considered unacceptable and may be rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply.</p>
<p>OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>All CLIN's As Required ___ calendar days after the date of <br />each individual delivery order</p>
<p>Offeror's Proposed Delivery Schedule <br />Item No. Quantity Within Days After Date of Contract</p>
<p>(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary <br />mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer may be determined unacceptable and may be rejected.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>EVALUATION</p>
<p>Award shall be made without discussions unless the Contracting Officer determines discussions are necessary. Quotations received in response to this synopsis/solicitation shall be evaluated utilizing the following technical, price and price-related factors:</p>
<p>(a) Technical - In order for a quotation to be considered technically acceptable the offeror MUST submit written verification from the OEM that the offeror is an authorized distributor for the OEM. Quotations that are received without written verification shall be rejected as nonresponsive.</p>

<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS -</strong> United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation W912L2-11-T-0011 is being issued as a Request for Quotation.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses for commercial items in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-42.  The associated NAICS code is 611699, unrestricted.  COMMERCIAL ITEM DESCRIPTION:  The USPFO for Arizona has a requirement for Professional Development Training Workshop, curriculum, and customized educational materials associated with the Combat and Operational Stress Fist Aid.<br><br>STATEMENT OF WORK<br>For Professional Development Training Workshop (PDTW)<br>Combat and Operational Stress First Aid (COSFA) development workshop FY-11<br>For the Arizona National Guard<br><br>1.0  INTRODUCTION<br><br>1.1  Purpose.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide contractor support to develop and deliver a Professional Development Training Workshop (PDTW) for Arizona National Guard Service Members and their Families.  Further, the Arizona National Guard requires contract support to hold a symposium and planning meeting to develop a National Guard Combat and Operational Stress First Aid (COSFA) curriculum to be delivered at one PDTW for the Arizona National Guard Service Members and their Families.<br><br>1.2  Background.  Family Programs in conjunction with the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program are responsible for sponsoring, developing and presenting the COSFA model for Arizona National Guard Service Members and families.  The PDTW will be an ongoing event conducted in Phoenix, Arizona, beginning upon the approval of the contract and continuing when services are requested. The purpose of the PDTW is to prepare the above personnel personally and professionally to facilitate and provide crisis care and awareness for Arizona National Guard personnel and other authorized members of the Department of the Army. The COSFA development workshop will also ensure that Arizona National Guard Service Members are prepared to effectively deliver inclusive operational stress care and provide training to other Service Members to help identify Service Members and their Families who are at risk. <br><br>The Arizona National Guard has identified the need and will implement the developed model of Combat Stress First Aid (COSFA) to be used in the aftermath of crisis events, which differs from traditional models of immediate stress intervention.  The COSFA implementation will create a curriculum, which will be developed into a PDTW held in Phoenix, Arizona, at the Arizona National Guard Papago Park Military Reservation upon approval of the contract and for future dates upon request. There will also be a second three-day PDTW conducted in the future at a later date to be determined. The curriculum shall entail the following components: 1. Introduction to the framework of the COSFA model, 2. Skills based training on how to use the stress first aid model for individuals in crisis, 3. How to use the stress first aid model to respond to units in distress, and 4. How to guide commands on the use and utility of the COSFA model.<br><br>1.3  Scope.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by a potential quoter:<br /><br />Question 1. Please clarify NIST's definition of "safe handling" related to delivery and recovery of chemicals? Is pouring of chemicals permitted within the Nanofab and if not, please clarify how the chemicals will be presented to the metal liftoff tool? (We are assuming the Nanofab does not have bulk delivery capabilities for solvents.)&nbsp;<br /><br />Answer 1.&nbsp; Pouring of chemicals is permitted and tool storage tank fill points should be easily accessible, unobstructed and provide a large enough opening for filling without spilling any chemical. Drain points should be valved, easily accessible and provide a flexible open-ended drain line 2-3 ft long. <br />
<p><br />Question 2. Does the Nanofab facility have its own solvent drain system or do we need to include pricing for a waste chemical collection system in our proposal? <br /><br />Answer 2.&nbsp; Per the specification, all chemicals should be recirculated back to the storage tank.</p>
<p>Question 3. Is manual loading/unloading and transfer of the wafers expected? <br /><br />Answer 3.&nbsp;Yes, there is no requirement for cassette to cassette processing.</p>
<p>Question 4. The requirement states " the tool shall support a spray solvent liftoff process". Does this mean ONLY spray processes will be considered, or does it mean a spray process combined with other methods (immersion, agitation, ultrasonics, etc) would also be desirable? Metal liftoff typically requires a variety of methods to be effective, and in a mixed-used fab such as we understand the Nanofab to be, a wider variety of processing techniques will likely prove more valuable than a single technique configuration. <br /><br />Answer 4. The tool should be a spray solvent liftoff process only. The NanoFab is already equipped with a variety of immersion processing equipment.</p>
<p>Question 5. Is it correct for us to assume precious metals may be lifted off from time to time (as is typically the case with metal liftoff processing). If the answer is yes, we are somewhat surprised by the lack of requirement for a reclamation system to allow recapture and reprocessing of these expensive materials. <br /><br />Answer 5. All chemicals will be recirculated back to the storage tank and metals will be reclaimed from there.</p>
<p>Question 6. Relative to the "4 solvents" referenced in the "Stronger consideration..." section:<br />a. Will all 4 be different chemicals? <br />Response:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there may be 4 different chemicals<br /><br />b. What temp range is required for each? <br />Response:&nbsp;&nbsp;Per the specification, all chemicals may be heated to 75C.<br /><br />c. Will each waste chem be allowed to drain into a single collection point or will dedicated collection connections be required? <br />Response:&nbsp;&nbsp;A single collection point is acceptable provided there is a mechanism to prevent two tanks draining at one time.<br /><br />d. Are dedicated rinse tanks required for each of the 4 solvents? <br />Response:&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be a single spray type DI water rinse.<br /><br />e. If the answer to (5) above is "yes", will dedicated recapture systems be required for each solvent? <br />Response:&nbsp;&nbsp;N/A</p>
<p>Question 7. For the processing of the wafer pieces down to 1" square, will this type of processing typically occur as single pieces or is batch processing required as well for these smaller pieces? <br /><br />Answer 7. Batch processing is desirable although not required.<br /><br />All terms and conditions of the original solicitation, including closing date and time, remain unchanged and in full effect.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by a potential quoter.<br /><br />Question 1. Is it intended that all solvents drain back to their respective supply tank or to a single tank to be used for all solvents as a drain receiver. <br />
<p><br />Answer 1.&nbsp; As stated in the specification, each solvent will be recirculated back to its respective supply tank.</p>
<p><br />Question 2. Is it intended that the DIW used for the spray rinse be drained to a facility drain or the common solvent/DIW drain.</p>
<p>Answer 2.&nbsp; As stated in the specification, the DI water will drain to the NIST house acid drain system.</p>
<p>Question 3. It is difficult to understand precisely the desire for batch processing.&nbsp; I am assuming that it means a spinner be provide that spins a batch of wafers simultaneously usually done in batches of up to 25 in a cassette like wafer receiver, is that what is wanted to do a batch. How many wafers/pieces constitute a suitable batch. It would be helpful to clarify the hoped for benefit of processing a "batch".</p>
<p>Answer 3.&nbsp; We would expect any whole wafer batch processing use industry standard wafer carriers such as 25 wafer cassettes. A custom carrier solution may be required to accommodate wafer pieces. A suitable batch size is a minimum of 6 wafers and/or pieces.<br /><br />All terms and conditions of the original solicitation, including closing date and time, remain unchanged and in full effect.</p>

<p>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-11-Q-200066 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>This solicitation documented and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted solicitation.

<p>The estimate quantity/parts list is attached in PDF and Excel to be used to submit your quote.</p>
<p><br />Award will be made to the offeror(s) proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, delivery and past performance.</p>
<p>An indefinite delivery Requirements contract is anticipated that will include a base year plus two option periods for a total period of performance of three years.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">This effort is to design and produce upgrades to either the ALQ-131(V) or ALQ-184(V) to increase capability against legacy, upgraded and modern threat systems. The upgraded EA pod configuration shall meet the performance requirements <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">for Increment 1 </span>of the <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Electronic Attack Pod Upgrade Performance Specification (GRWA-SPEC11-001) </span>and will require the incorporation of receiver signal trackers and Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM). The upgraded EA pod configuration shall be based on the incorporation of Critical Technology Elements <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(those technology elements which are new to the EA pod and are needed to meet the system's operational requirements)</span> that have been previously demonstrated in a relevant environment. The objective of this effort is to design, fabricate, integrate, install, document, and test the modification <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">into an upgraded ALQ-131(V) or ALQ-184(V)</span> system prior to full scale production. This modification will entail the design and documentation of the upgraded pod hardware (H/W) and software (S/W), the qualification and design verification testing of the hardware and software, performance of a pod reliability growth program, identification of changes <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>to existing ALQ-131/ALQ-184 required Organizational (O-), Intermediate (I-), and Depot (D-) level Support Equipment (SE) changes, design and test of SE modification kits, revision of SE documentation, and revision and publication of pod and SE technical order changes. During the Engineering Manufacturing and Development (EMD) portion of this effort the contractor shall build, modify and deliver four (4) prototype upgraded pods and two (2) modified sets of SE (to include any new SE hardware required) for use in development and testing. As an option during the basic contracting period on this effort, the contractor shall produce up to forty two (42) Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) EA upgraded pods, up to eight (8) LRIP EA SE kits, and up to four (4) Spare Kits to be used during developmental/operational testing. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This acquisition will also include 5 annual options with a quantity range of 1-90 each for the EA Pods, 1-12 each for the EA SE Kits, and 1-12 each for the Spare Kits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The EMD portion of this contract will be Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and the Production and Options will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The acquisition will not be set aside for small businesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The approximate issue date will be 9 March 2011 with an approximate response date of 8 April 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI) for the Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) Program
<SOLNBR>SMC-11-41
<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<RESPDATE>032111
<CONTACT>Don Ruffin, Program Manager, Phone 310.653.3905, Email don.ruffin@us.af.mil - Lorraine Lewis-Wilson, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 653-0920, Email lorraine.lewis-wilson@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>16a. Description:
<p>The Defense Weather Systems Directorate (DWSD) Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) program office, on behalf of the United States Air Force, is seeking information from companies who could provide a production capability of seven (7) space-based Radio Frequency (RF) beacons flight articles and one (1) Engineering Development Unit (EDU) for remote sensing of ionospheric scintillation and line-of-sight Total Electron Content (TEC), and the associated payload to space vehicle integration and test support, and an option for commercially priced controlled storage facilities needed for the program. The RF beacon flight article is defined as a standard RF beacon. The addition of the language "flight article" should not imply that we are requesting anything other than the standard RF beacon.</p>
<p>Measurements of signals transmitted by a RF beacon flight article can be used to measure ionospheric properties such as the TEC along the signal propagation path, amplitude and phase scintillation indices at the transmitted frequencies. The TEC observations can be ingested into global assimilative models to improve ionospheric specification, and the scintillation observations can be used to estimate ionosphere-induced degradation of communication/navigation signals across the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>16b. Purpose:</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes. The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on existing technologies, or existing technologies with possible minor modifications that can be used to meet the sensing capabilities described in paragraph 16d, incorporating the listed Government assumptions. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the Government is interested in estimated cost and schedule information for individual requirements defined in paragraph 16d.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI# SMC-11-41 is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. We are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer from any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>

<p>16d. Sensing Capability Information Sought:</p>
<p>The Government is seeking information that provides an approach/information concerning the design and manufacturing of the RF beacon flight articles that would enable transmissions in the following frequency bands:</p>
<p>&bull; Coherent continuous wave UHF (e.g., 400 MHz) signal<br />&bull; Coherent continuous wave L-band (e.g., 1067 MHz) signal<br />&bull; Coherent continuous wave S-band (&gt;2 GHz) signal</p>
<p>The Government is also interested in responses containing approaches/ideas/designs that might provide additional value that could include modulation of the continuous wave signals.</p>
<p>To mitigate interference issues with a potentially co-manifested radio occultation sensor, the L-band frequency should be selected to avoid the Global Navigation Satellite Signal (GNSS) bands (GPS, Galileo, GLONASS) and particular care should be taken in the instrument design to ensure that no spurious emissions in the GNSS bands exist. While this RFI is focused on a space-based transmitter, the Government understands that the capabilities of potential ground receivers are a factor in the RF beacon flight article design. Responses to this RFI should include a discussion of the assumptions made relative to the ground-based component of the transmitter-receiver system. Furthermore, the implications of any proposed waveforms on the complexity of the ground-based receiver systems required to exploit the transmitted signals should be discussed.</p>
<p>The Government is requesting responses from respondents with established manufacturing processes and equipment for producing the desired RF beacon flight articles. The Government is seeking responses that demonstrate technology and design maturity along with the associated manufacturing readiness. The respondent should provide Level II cost and delivery schedule estimates by fiscal year as well as their assumptions associated with providing:</p>
<p>&bull; Seven (7) RF beacon flight articles<br />&bull; One (1) Engineering Development Unit (EDU)<br />&bull; One (1) power and data interface simulator<br />&bull; Ground Support Equipment (GSE)<br />&bull; Space vehicle integration and test support<br />&bull; Controlled environment storage option - Priced by month<br />&bull; Packaging and shipping containers <br />&bull; Launch and early operations anomaly support</p>
<p>The required funding profile across the fiscal years involved to meet the program schedule should be provided.</p>
<p>The following Government assumptions should be used for cost and schedule estimation:</p>
<p>1. Cost/schedule estimate will be at 80% confidence level and responders may also include figures from various confidence levels, with appropriate justification;<br />2. Solutions will be low risk by using high TRL components (i.e. minimum of TRL 6), the Government is willing to assess lower TRL with appropriate justification;<br />3. No Government facilities or property will be provided;<br />4. Anticipated contract award during 4th quarter Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2012;<br />5. Sensor delivery dates: (a) Engineering Development Unit (EDU) 4th quarter GFY 2013; (b) First RF beacon flight article 1st quarter GFY 2014; (c) Remaining 6 RF beacon flight articles 2nd quarter GFY 2014;<br />6. Spacecraft integration/pre-launch support: through launch in 4th quarter GFY 2015;<br />7. Estimate storage option based on a monthly rate;<br />8. Costs should be broken out to the lowest level possible;<br />9. Program level costs will include Systems Engineering, Program Management, Design, Manufacturing, Integration, Assembly and Test support, etc;<br />10. For contract type recommendations see Section 5.</p>
<p>Again, these assumptions are given for cost estimation and planning purposes only and the Government is only seeking information for market research purposes.</p>
<p>In your approach/responses please include the following, as well:</p>
<p>&bull; Discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations<br />&bull; Information pertaining to utilization of small business subcontractor/s, if applicable.</p>
<p>16e. Desired Technical Goals:</p>
<p>The RF beacon flight article should have a reliability of 95% probability of success (Ps) for the 5-year mission life. The altitude of the spacecraft carrying the RF beacon flight article will be 840 km or less. The command interface to the host spacecraft will be RS422. Measurement goals for TEC and scintillation measurements are provided in the following bullets. Scintillation measurement goals apply at each of the RF beacon flight article frequencies.</p>
<p>&bull; Measurement: Slant Path TEC; Measurement Range: 0-1000 TEC; Measurement Accuracy: 0.01/3.0 TEC (relative/absolute); Absolute TEC measurements are to be considered an objective requirement.<br />&bull; Measurement: Scintillation Indices; Measurement Range: S4: 0-1.5 and &sigma;&phi;: 0-1 radians; Measurement Accuracy: S4: 0.05 and &sigma;&phi;: 0.05 radians</p>
<p>The Government is interested in limiting the size, weight and power (SWaP) of the RF beacon flight article as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; &lt;5.0 kg (electronics and antenna included)<br />&bull; &lt;14 W<br />&bull; Electronics volume &lt;15&times;8&times;6 cm</p>
<p>Responses that suggest excursions outside of the SWaP limits, or which do not fully meet the measurements goals, are still of interest, but should include discussions of the rationale and relevant technical trades involved.</p>
<p>16f. Sample Response Outline:</p>
<p>The following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and to structure the responses for ease of analysis by the Government. Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit.</p>
<p>Section 1 - Technological Alternatives</p>
<p>Briefly describe one or more technological alternatives, including the reliability, flight heritage and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives (3-5 pages per alternative).</p>
<p>Section 2 - Feasibility Assessment</p>
<p>Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks (1 page per alternative).</p>
<p>Section 3 - Cost and Schedule Estimates</p>
<p>Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is an 80% confidence estimate of cost and schedule risk. Responders may also include figures from various confidence levels, with appropriate justification (2-3 pages).<br />The assumptions in paragraph 16d may be used for cost and schedule estimation.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Corporate Expertise</p>
<p>Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and any other information you deem relevant. Responses from small and small disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.</p>
<p>Please describe current and relevant experience that relates to the purpose of this RFI, including management and operations approach, and any lessons learned (3-5 page count).</p>
<p>Section 5 - Additional Materials</p>
<p>Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussions you deem appropriate. Include any recommended structure of the requirements in the event the Government plans to issue an RFP. Also, current department policy requires the use of Fixed Price (FP) contracts to the maximum extent possible. Please include in your response how your company could accomplish this effort under a FFP contract and assess the challenges, constraints, and risks that could arise from this contract type.</p>

<DESC>This notice invites contractors to the Industry Day for Advanced Processing Build (APB) FY13 (APB-13) under Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N0002410IWS5A01, issued on 8 June 2010.

It also indicated that industry days may be conducted in order to elaborate on these areas of research interest.  Accordingly, contractors are invited to attend an Industry Day to communicate capability development objectives for its research interests in advanced undersea technologies in the area of submarine signal processing for APB-13 as indicated under paragrapgh 1.2 A) of the BAA, as well as a newly added area of interest, "Leverage Human Systems Interface and commercial expertise to create more intuitive displays".
 This notice reschedules the Industry Day event postponed from 9-10 February 2011 to 24-25 May 2011.  

This Industry Day will focus on improved, more intuitive interfaces and capabilities, and build on APB-11 capabilities in submarine signal processing, localization, image enhancement and automation for APB-13.  The APB Industry Day will be held on 24 and 25 May 2011 at Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems & Sensors in Manassas, VA from 9:00 a.m. to approximately 3:00 p.m.  The Industry Day will include briefs classified up to the SECRET level, which requires each participant to submit a security clearance prior to the meeting.  Due to limitations on space, only three (3) persons per company location will be allowed to participate.
  Parties interested in attending should request a registration package (which will include directions for submission of the security clearances) by e-mailing meghan.pituch@cgifederal.com with the subject ADVANCED UNDERSEA TECHNOLOGIES INDUSTRY DAY REGISTRATION REQUEST.

<DESC>***&nbsp; The solicitation has been posted on April 25, 2011. The due date of proposals has been revised to June 23, 2011 as indicated on Block 9 of the SF-33. Refer to Section L.1 of the soliciation for the date and time of the site visit. ***<br /><br />** The expected soliciation posting date has been revised to <strong>April 25,</strong> 2011. A new site visit date will be publicized when the soliciation is posted. **<br /><br />The United States Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide local guard services at the U.S. Mission Maputo. The Mission requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in this Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.
<p>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a time and materials contract, with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable elements, for local guard services, on behalf of the U.S. Mission Maputo. The Government will solicit this requirement as a full and open competition using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The Government plans to award one contract as a result of this acquisition.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is&nbsp;<strong>1,045,472</strong> hours.</p>

<DESC>
1)	 Site Visit Change:  Pre-Bid Site Visit rescheduled for 04-27-2011 at 1300 hrs, (1:00 p.m. EDT) in the A&MMN Conference Room.


2)	Evaluation Factors:  This procurement is a 100% Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Set-Aside.  This procurement is being conducted as a competitive, negotiated request for proposals (RFP) that is to be awarded after a "Lowest Price Technically Acceptable" evaluation.  

This means that only submissions from SDVOSB entities will be considered for award.  In order to qualify as a valid SDVOSB, an offeror must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (www.ccr.gov) as a SDVOSB under the applicable NAICS code for this project (please see SF 1442, block 10 for NAICS code and small business cutoff).  Additionally, offerors must be registered with the VetBiz database at www.vetbiz.gov.  Enrollment in the CCR database will require the offeror to have applied for and been assigned a Duns and Bradstreet (DUNS) number.  Enrollment in these databases MUST be COMPLETE by the time of representation (offer submission) or they will be considered nonresponsive and rejected without additional consideration.

Once proposals are received, they will be evaluated for technical acceptance based on a series of "Go/No-Go" factors that will be given a pass/fail rating based on submitted deliverables.  The various deliverables and pass/fail criteria are as follows:

1.	Past Performance/Technical capability - Offer must show that he has the capability, personnel, and financial resources to complete the project.  Offeror need not have performed the exact type of project for the VA before, but he should provide evidence of technical competency based on similar work or the training and certifications necessary to perform the work.  
a.	Deliverables: 
i.	Resume/CV of any and all key personnel who would be involved with the project in the event of contract award.  Resume MUST show prior experience of a similar type of work to that described in the RFP or clearly display that the employee has the technical certifications/capacity/abilities to complete his share of project tasks.  RESUME MUST INCLUDE NAMES AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS OF REFERENCES (AT LEAST THREE) WHO CAN VALIDATE THE DETAILS OF THE RESUME.  Lack of references or references who cannot be contacted after a reasonable effort by the Contracting Officer will result in a failure of this item.  References who refuse to acknowledge/validate information on the resume will likewise result in a fail.
ii.	Description(s) of prior projects performed similar to the work described in the RFP, or projects/items that show evidence of technical competency in the critical elements of the project as described in the RFP.  Descriptions must include dollar value, key personnel/subcontractors involved, and a reference who may be contacted to verify that the project was successfully completed by the offeror.  The same rules about references as those explained in item (i) apply.  At least three examples are required.  These examples MUST clearly exhibit proficiency in all necessary skills/trades/elements of performance or this item will be graded as a 'fail.'  CONTRACTORS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT WRITTEN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS FILLED OUT BY PRIOR JOB MANAGERS/COTRS WHICH ARE SIGNED AND DATED TO FULFILL THIS DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENT.  If written past performance information is not given, the same standards applied to contacting references listed in (i) above will be used.
iii.	Any and all permits, certifications, evidence of training, degrees, etc. required to prove that the prime and/or any subconsultant is fully technically/legally qualified to work on a project, system, or geographic area in necessary trades.
1.	There are no anticipated certificates required for this specific project.
2.	Evidence of adequate bonding
a.	Deliverables:
i.	A bid bond, backed by a treasury-listed surety (please see http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/c570.html) or other acceptable proof of equity to guarantee the proposed offer and the next lowest technically acceptable price in the event that the offeror cannot offer the submitted price.  Absence of a bid bond in the submitted offer will result automatically in a 'fail' for this item.
b.	Additional Notes:
i.	Performance and payment bonds are also required for this RFP, but not at time of offer submission on a go/no-go basis.  If performance and payment bonding is not furnished after successful negotiation and award, the contract will be terminated for default which may result in a financial claim against the offeror and will eliminate the offeror from future work with VISN 2 (see 1(b)).

3.	Acceptable price formatting
a.	Deliverables:
i.	Offeror's price is presented in an EMIS-style breakout sheet (each individual price category is identified in as much detail as possible, unit prices are multiplied by proposed quantities to reach line item totals, line item totals are added together to reach subtotal, overhead is applied as a clearly indicated percentage to subtotal, profit is applied as a clearly indicated percentage of overhead + subtotal).  Lump sum totals will be graded as a 'fail.'  Pricing that includes options or other non-definite/non-fixed totals will be graded as a 'fail.'   Labor unit prices that are below Davis-Bacon wage rates will be graded as a 'fail.'  Subcontractor pricing presented as a lump sum will be graded as a 'fail' unless that pricing is further broken down in the offeror's cost proposal.

PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY ONE 'FAIL' OF ANY ONE OF THESE THREE ITEMS WILL RESULT IN REJECTION OF THE OFFER WITHOUT ANY FURTHER CONSIDERATION FOR AWARD, OR ANALYSIS/NEGOTIATION OF THE OFFERED PRICE.

Following technical acceptance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether or not to establish a competitive range.  If no competitive range is established, the lowest priced technically acceptable offer will receive award without additional discussions or exchanges and notice will be tendered to all offerors.  If necessary, a competitive range may be established due to a clear grouping of the most reasonable offers while eliminating outliers at either an extreme high or low price in regard to the established Independent Government Estimate.  Competitive range may likewise be established to limit the volume of offers considered for negotiation by selecting a number of the most favorable priced offers.  Discussions (negotiations) will only be held if a competitive range is established, and only with the members of the established competitive range.  There will be no pre-established number of offers selected for inclusion in the competitive range, THIS WILL BE COMPLETELY AT THE DISCRETION OF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.

Following determination of competitive range, if needed, the Contracting Officer will enter into meaningful discussions (negotiations) with all offerors remaining in consideration.  This will usually consist of a written statement of the Government's negotiating position in response to the initial offer.  Discussions may take place in written, oral, or electronic format at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Discussions may continue as long as needed to reach a determination of which price is the lowest of those offered.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, offerors may be furnished a request for Final Proposal Revisions (FPR's) advising them to submit their best and final offer and closing out negotiations for all offerors.  The use of FPR's will be at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, and is NOT a mandatory step prior to award.

After the above steps have taken place, the lowest negotiated technically acceptable price will be selected for award and notice will be tendered to all members of the competitive range.
