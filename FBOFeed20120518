<DESC><p>Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) JSSIP III</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes notice of intent that the Aerial Ground Surveillance Systems Division (HBG), Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom AFB, is anticipating release of a sole source solicitation to award an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract to Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, 2000 W NASA Blvd, Melbourne, FL 32904-2322 (the incumbent contractor), for technical upgrades of the Joint STARS, including systems engineering, design, development, manufacture, installation, test and demonstrations, production and retrofit, engineering change proposals, documentation, Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO), logistics support and sustainment, simulations of solutions, initial operator training, warranties, and any other improvement type efforts. In addition, the contract will include Engineering Service Tasks (ESTs) for analyses, studies, systems engineering, planning, prototyping, qualification/test, training, and flight-test infrastructure for proposed upgrades and improvements. The current follow-on JSSIP II contract (FA8708-06-D-0001) was awarded in 2005 sole-source to Northrop Grumman Corporation and the ordering period is in effect until March of 2013. The prior JSSIP contract was awarded in 1999 sole source to Northrop Grumman Corporation and was in effect until March of 2005. The anticipated follow-on JSSIP III contract is anticipated to be a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that will be in effect from approximately April 2013 until April 2018.The estimated maximum value of the follow-on contract will be approximately $415 M over the five-year ordering period. This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal, it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, and it should not be construed as a commitment by the Government. From the inception of the JSSIP program, Northrop Grumman Corporation has been the sole system designer, developer, and manufacturer for the E-8C Joint STARS weapon system, an ACAT II program. The Government believes that only Northrop Grumman Corporation possesses the necessary systems engineering and integration experience to meet the requirements of the JSSIP III modernization programs. Northrop Grumman Corporation, as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), has designed and developed a unique hardware and software architecture, which would create substantial inefficiencies for a new contractor beginning development on all follow-on delivery orders under the JSSIP III contract. The statutory authority to do so is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), which states "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition." This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). Its issuance does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Nevertheless, all responses received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information marked with proprietary legend without written permission from the respondent. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to ESC.<br />Contracting Office Address: <br />75 Vandenberg Drive Bldg 1630 Hanscom AFB, MA <br />Point of Contact(s): Ross Joseph, Buyer, ross.joseph@us.af.mil</p>

<DESC>Title: Chronic Inflammatory Disease Project
<p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Health Effects Laboratory Division (HELD), Toxicology and Molecular Biology Branch, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to the University of Pittsburgh to assist NIOSH research scientist in developing and implementing state-of-the-art genetic data analyses and approaches as part of their research projects.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>I. Background<br />The services contemplated under this contract are considered to be an Other<br />Function as defined by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy in OFPP letter<br />11-01 and by HHS in Acquisition Policy Memorandum 2012-01.</p>
<p>Our projects focus on immune-mediated and chronic inflammatory diseases<br />including occupational asthma, chronic beryllium disease and irritant contact<br />dermatitis and investigate genotypes, haplotypes and interactions important in the<br />development, progression and severity of such diseases. These studies will also<br />assess gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.<br />CDC's mission is to promote health and quality of life by preventing and<br />controlling disease, injury, and disability. CDC seeks to accomplish its mission<br />by working with partners throughout the nation and world to monitor health,<br />detect and investigate health problems, conduct research to enhance prevention,<br />develop and advocate sound public health projects, implement prevention<br />strategies, promote healthy behaviors, foster safe and healthful environments, and<br />provide leadership and training.</p>
<p>II. Project Objectives<br />Genetic data is generated by high-density and high-throughput genotyping<br />platforms (5' nuclease real-time PCR, microarray technology-Illumina<br />GoldenGate genotyping assays). The genetic variations in MHC region are<br />investigated using SNP microarray platform from Illumina&reg;. The MHC panel set<br />of Illumina&reg; consists of two arrays (2,360 loci) with 2kb average spacing of the<br />MHC locus. The majority of markers are in strong linkage disequilibrium(LD) to<br />at least one other marker. Strong intergenic LD would complicate the assignment<br />of single association signals to particular MHC genes. Therefore, the LD pattern<br />in this region need to be characterized by using a dense map of SNPs and define<br />haplotypes blocks. The custom panel consists of ~1,536 variants that are known to<br />be involved in disease process. Using these platforms, we will examine the<br />influence of genetic variations in selected genes (immune/inflammatory,<br />antioxidant genes and other genes of interest) in the development and outcomes of<br />occupational diseases. The analyses will also include the assessment of gene-gene<br />and gene-environment interactions.</p>
<p>III. Scope of Work<br />The contractor will assist NIOSH research scientist in developing and<br />implementing state-of-the-art genetic data analyses and approaches as part of their<br />research projects. This includes to direct the genetic data analyses and produce the<br />summary results of data analyses, along with the formulation of the biological<br />hypotheses tested in the data analyses, in consultation with the NIOSH<br />investigator. Contractor will analyze raw microarray data, create novel<br />computational approaches and analytical tools as required by research goals,<br />develop new applications or customize existing applications to meet specific<br />scientific project needs and produce the summary results of computations.<br />Meetings will be arranged at regular intervals to discuss the progressions in data<br />analyses. Contractor will also assist NIOSH investigator to prepare the scientific<br />reports of data analyses for possible peer-reviewed publications.<br />Oversight and overall direction of the contractor's work will be provided by the<br />NIOSH Project Officer. The contractor will interact with, collaborate with, and<br />respond to feedback and technical direction from the Project Officer as<br />appropriate to the objectives of the project and the scope of work herein detailed.&nbsp; Establishing the nature and extent of such interactions will be the responsibility of the contractor in consultation with the Project Officer, and will be in accordance with government contract procedures.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, Reference 000HCCCB-2012-46227, Centers for Disease Control, NIOSH, ATTN: Rebecca Mullenax, MS: GD, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with The University of Pittsburgh, 3520 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3320, as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<CONTACT>Vallerie M Redd, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2845, Fax 770-488-2670, Email gfj3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a sole source contract to Thermo Electron North America, 1400 N. Point Parkway, Suite 10, West Palm Beach, FL 33407 for the acquisition of an Element XR double focusing magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) with reverse Neir-Johnson geometry.<br />&nbsp;<br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 6 months. <br /><br />The Element XR mass spectrometer will assist the Tobacco Inorganic Group in the development of methods to analyze samples for the presence of harmful and potentially harmful substances in tobacco and smoke and performs mass resolution tasks that a quadrupole instrument cannot perform. ThermoFisher is the only vendor capable of offering a double focusing magnetic sector instrument with reverse Neir-Johnson sector geometry for assuring complete decoupling of electric fields in the electric sector from any other electric fields such as the field originating in the ICP Radio Frequency generator in order to prevent effects on mass scanning - i.e., decreasing resolution or sensitivity. In addition, the Element XR retardation lens provides for improved abundance sensitivity. <br /><br />This instrument is capable of standard flow injection analysis for elemental analysis using external calibration and standard addition, as well as isotope ratio analysis with the software, and capable of resolving a broad spectrum of mass spectral interferences with resolution from 400 in low resolution (10% valley definition), to 4,000 in medium resolution and 10,000 in high resolution. It has a triple mode detector for analytical range of 12 orders of magnitude signal intensity with retardation lens for improved abundance sensitivity. This will enhance the laboratory's capabilities for analysis of toxic metals from very low concentrations such as beryllium to very high concentrations such as iron or barium in the same analysis for increased throughput. Magnetic sector is required for a number of analyses that are not possible with quadrupole instruments due to sensitivity and resolution constraints. Further, ThermoFisher is the only vendor that can supply an instrument with identical software for method crossover between instruments with a single method in the event of failure of the other instrument, or for increasing throughput capacity with the same method. ThermoFisher is the only vendor of magnetic sector instrumentation with hundreds of instruments in the field and multiple service engineers for support in the U.S.<br /><br />We searched for other vendors and found that no other vendors meet our requirements. Those identifed do not have identical software and functionality to support method crossover for the purpose of increased capacity or duplication of effort in the event of catastrophic failure of the older equivalent instrument. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Thermo Electron North America. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>via email ONLY</strong></span> at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-N-14335 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN June 1, 2012.<br />&nbsp;<br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Enteric Diseases Laboratory Branch intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 1161 Avenue South, Nashville, TN. The collaborators/contractors, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) will conduct a bridging study with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to determine the correlation of a newly developed pertussis Luminex IgG assay with a standardized multi-dilution IgG ELISA. <br />VUMC will evaluate comparability of their ELISA to two different antigen sources (VUMC in-house antigen and NIH antigens) for the four pertussis antigens: pertussis toxin (PT), pertactin (PRN), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), fimbrae 2/3 (FIM 2/3). Once comparability has been established, VUMC will use a standardized multi-dilution IgG ELISA (gold standard) to test 400 anonymized NHANES III samples, in 3 independent runs, to the four pertussis NIH antigens. Samples will be shipped directly from the NHANES serum repository. For those antigens in which comparability could not be established, VUMC will use their in-house antigens for testing of NHANES III specimens.

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by Palmetto GBA under contract number HHSM-500-2010-M0001Z authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011.</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for:  PROCEDSSING OF NiTiHf ALLOY.    The processing of a heat of an experimental NiTi-20Hf alloy developed by NASA GRC.  The alloy requires unusually strict compositional control (an order of magnitude greater than typical commercial alloys) and is also high in Ti and Hf (very reactive elements) and thus is extremely difficult to process.  Therefore, the material should only be processed by someone with demonstrated experience with similar alloys. 
 Flowserve Corporation has demonstrated this experience.  Under an ongoing collaborative effort, GRC/Boeing has been working with Flowserve to develope processing capability specifically for the alloy requested.  This material meets all compositional and shape memory property requirements, defined previously by GRC personnel.  This is a duplicate the previous effort.    
 GRC intends to purchase the items from FLOWSERVE CORPORATION, 2200 EAST MONUMENT AVE., DAYTON OHIO 45402. 
 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. 
 The Sole Source is under the authority of FAR reference 13.106-1(b)1.

<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for LS-DYNA Software Licenses Renewal. 
 NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from Livermore Software Technology Corp (LSTC). The LS-DYNA software was developed by LSTC and NASA has used the LSTC LS-DYNA code for approximately 11 years. LS-DYNA is the only software that includes all the tools necessary to develop impact landing loads and is the only product that is compatible with the analyses which were previously performed by NASA. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to provide a similar product, and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition. 
 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.    
 Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on 05/22/2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. 
 Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. 
 All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. 
 NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html </A>   .

<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for a 10W Erbium Doped Fiber Laser (EDFA). 
 NASA/LARC intends to purchase the EDFA from IPG Photonics Corporation. The 10W EDFA will replace the existing IPG 5W EDFA and is the only completely compatible unit with the existing opto-mechnical specifications (including size, volume, fiber connectors, adapters, and fixtures) under the ongoing NASA ACES instrumentation that uses the IPG's 5W unit. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to design, test, and validate a similar unit, and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Agilent Technologies, 2850 Centerville Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19808-1610 for the purchase of a one year service agreement. <br /><br />BACKGROUND:<br />This request is for a service contract The Trans-NIH RNAi initiative conducts high-throughput siRNA screens in collaboration with intramural investigators. The initiative's work encompasses assay development, screening, and initial follow-up. In August 2010, a fully automated, robotic system was installed by Agilent Technologies to conduct genome-wide siRNA screens and associated operations. Since that time, NCATS has completed a number of successful genome-wide screening campaigns on this platform. Screening has revealed novel components of important cell signaling pathways and genes that affect the activity of therapeutic agents. NCATS is now embarking on many more genome-wide screens. These screens are dependent upon a number of integral parts, including the management of siRNA libraries, high throughput transfection of mammalian cells, high-throughput addition of assay-specific stimuli, and high-throughput endpoint assays such as automated imaging. The Agilent system has proven reliable for all of these components. A service contract is needed for the Agilent platform. This service is required to ensure reliable and reproducible operation of this system.
<p>Period of Performance: August 19, 2012- August 18, 2013<br />DELIVERABLES:</p>
<p>Field Service:</p>
<p>Agilent Automation Solution's Field Service Engineer is responsible for break-down repairs, annual preventative maintenance, and upgrades to Customer's equipment. Agilent Automation Solutions is also responsible for supplying Customer with parts, documentation, and updates to keep their machines running. Examples of Agilent Automation Solution's responsibilities are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Low-level service work (eg: any repair beyond standard adjustments-eg: parts replacement) and in-depth troubleshooting<br />&bull; Parts replacements such as circuit boards, pneumatics, motors, encoder wheels &amp; readers, machined parts<br />&bull; Hardware upgrades<br />&bull; Software upgrades<br />&bull; Scheduling and performing annual preventative maintenance<br />&bull; Documentation updates<br />&bull; Communication from Agilent Automation Solutions to Customer<br />&bull; Escalating service calls as necessary through the correct channels at Agilent Automation Solutions, whether hardware, software or application related <br />&bull;Following up with an electronic copy of the service report to the contact person</p>
<p>Technical Support:</p>
<p>&bull; Cover phone and service.automation@agilent.com email from the hours of 7 am to 5:30pm, PST, Monday to Friday <br />&bull; Open service call &amp; provide service call number to the Customer for future reference <br />&bull; Provide quick, accurate, and efficient troubleshooting of problem.</p>
<p>&bull; Factory recommended replacement parts. <br />&bull; Agilent's Proprietary software updates<br />&bull; Agilent factory authorized service representatives<br />&bull; proprietary factory recommended upgrades <br />&bull; Escalation services to resolve difficult problems. This can include replacement of an instrument, if necessary under an Agilent service contract.<br />&bull; Based on problem description and troubleshooting with the Customer, decide if the<br />&bull; Problem requires an on-site service visit or if the machine should be returned to Agilent<br />&bull; Automation Solutions for depot repair<br />&bull; Prepare any necessary field service kit (information, parts, and instructions) for the Field Service Engineer</p>
<p>Applications:<br />&bull; Support Customer with applications-specific questions on existing protocols, hardware, and software.<br />&bull; Act as a resource to laboratory solutions for future automation needs<br />&bull; Perform basic customer-specific testing (eg: testing of specific plate types) to ensure ease of integration by customers</p>
<p>Upgrades:<br />&bull; Inform customer of any hardware and software upgrades that may be of benefit to the Customer. Bugs and workaround solutions should be communicated as well.<br />&bull; If the upgrade is not covered under the service agreement, submit a quotation for work to the Customer for consideration. <br />&bull; Perform all upgrade work in a professional manner, following the prescribed procedures.<br />&bull; Test the unit fully according to prescribed procedures.<br />&bull; Inform customer of any problems and the readiness status.<br />&bull; If work is on-site, provide service report for customer to sign in acknowledgement of work completed.</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>These services will ensure reliable data and hasten repair in the event of instrument failure. Importantly, Agilent Technologies is the only provider of this mission critical service and they do not authorize any other parties to service their instruments. In order to provide the necessary service required by this specialized and custom configured system, NCATS must use the specified parts, accessories, and upgraded software to fully enhance the capability of this critical unit. Service performed by a contractor other than Agilent Technologies' authorized support would invalidate Agilent warranties and the terms of the contract proposal.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334516 and the Size Standard is 500 Employees. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) on behalf of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a non-competitive basis to Philips Medical Systems, 595 Miner Road, Highland Heights, OH 44143 for a clinical science workstation diskpack configuration and mDixon software upgrade.</p>
<p>The clinical science workstation diskpack configuration consists of a HP XW8600 workstation, diskpack boxes and an extended disk drive cable. This hardware configuration is required to permit continuity of ongoing clinical studies and for the Longitudinal Study on Aging. Specifically, it allows for the MRI software to be upgraded to the latest release while maintaining the accessibility of the current software. This is critical as changes incorporated into the latest software release could result in systematic errors in data collected for ongoing studies and the operation of both software releases is necessary to perform a thorough comparison for quality assurance measures. The hardware is a custom research configuration that can only be supplied by Philips Medical Systems as it requires proprietary specifications to interface with NIA's existing Philips MRI equipment.</p>
<p>The mDixon software is required for the investigation of body composition studies in NIA's Clinical Research Branch. It allows for the acquisition and processing of images using NIA's Philips magnetic resonance imaging scanner, permitting large regions of anatomic coverage in short imaging times resulting in spatially resolved maps of muscle and fat volume ratios. Philips Medical Systems is the sole provider of the proprietary software. This software is the only software available that can interface with NIA's magnetic resonance imaging scanner.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR 12 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 10:00 AM E.T., May 25, 2012 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIA to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, the vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at ww.ccr.gov. Please reference announcement number NOI-2554438 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>The Providencecenter has a requirement for medical storage cabinets for a new Specilaty Clinic.
Innerspace Medical Storage units have been chosen based on the research and experience of the 
clinical nurse managers. The unique storage needs of the speciaty clinic functions and the design 
parameters of the rooms within the new specilaty addition. Rooms within the clinic addition require 
unique storage solutions to support the clinics operating at any given time.Small exam rooms offered
only limited room and opportunities for placement of required equipment and furniture, and any remaining space was allotted for storage. Only Innerspace had the appropriately sized cabintery with the dimmensions to fit the limited space. Innerspace is also able to provide medical storage cabinets with glass doors and finishes that meet the requirements of the VA Infection Control requirements. The Innerspace quote
includes accessories, assembly and installation which other vendors did not.
Itis imperative that the requirement, which is the Inerspace products, be provided in a few weeks which is when the spaces will be waiting for the cabinets. The Innerspace design allows flexibilty
of placement of placement since blocking is not required in the walls. The storgae cabinets are supported on the floor rather than wall mounted. The Innerspace medical storage units meet the requirements of size,
visibility and access required by the clinical staff. The current cabinets in use by the clinical staff
at Providence VA Medical Center are not efficient, do not meet IRCA requirements and are not easliy maintained. Although other distributors may be able to supply the Innspace medical storage cabinets,
Claflin is the preferred vendor for Innerspace in the New England area and is the Medical Center's Prime vendor.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS MARKET RESEARCH. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice.<br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a need to obtain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Small Business Community to include but not limited to Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) to compete and perform a potential Firm Fixed Price Level of Effort IDIQ Contract. <br /><br />NGA intends to award on a competitive basis an administrative service contract for the Enterprise Support for Administrative Services (ESAS) program. This acquisition activity would provide administrative support across the agency upon completion of the current Administrative Services contract, which has a period of performance end date of 30 June 2013.<br /><br />ESAS anticipates a labor category structure that would support Executive and non-Executive leadership level offices across the agency. This may consist of Executive labor categories for those offices with Senior Executive Service (SES)/Defense Intelligence Senior Leader (DISL), and Secretary labor categories Services for all other offices (or as needed to perform the standard administrative tasks not requiring an Executive labor category). Note: The exact labor category structure is still being defined. The scope difference between the Executive Administrator and Secretary would differ in complexity (both quantifiably and qualitatively). It is foreseen that the Level of office within the organization and level of administrative responsibilities would determine the labor category required. Regardless of the level, contractors placed on the ESAS contract would be expected to provide the highest level of administrative support.<br /><br />Depending on the final requirements definition and the labor category structure and description, the candidates selected to support the ESAS contract may be required to meet certain educational and/or training requirements in addition to having an adequate number of years of work experience in the administrative career field. Contractor personnel proposed to support NGA administrative requirements shall have been fully interviewed screened, and had their qualifications verified through references and/or prior experience with the ESAS contractor. This is to ensure the upmost professionalism, character, aptitude, and qualifications to meet the administrative requirements of NGA's various offices. Contractor personnel assigned to the ESAS contract will be expected to present a professional appearance and demeanor, and demonstrate excellent office etiquette.<br /><br />ESAS contractor personnel would work on-site at NGA Campus East (NCE) and NGA Campus West (NCW) locations, but other CONUS and OCUNUS locations may be realized at a later date. The core work hours would occur primarily between 0600 and 1800 hours with occasional support required outside of these hours. An occasional instance of overtime may occur with some offices more than others. Travel may also be required but this is not expected to occur often. Contractor administrative personnel supporting ESAS shall possess a TS/SCI security clearance; and who can be vetted by NGA's security adjudication (i.e. crossover) process to enable placement within 21 business days or less.<br /><br />Offices with ESAS administrative requirements would expect uninterrupted support. Therefore, sources interested in this notice that may eventually be given the opportunity to bid on ESAS would need to ensure a management approach that enables continuous administrative support during times of temporary absence and vacancy.
<p>The following notionally summarizes the potential responsibilities and expectations foreseen for ESAS administrative labor category levels. ESAS would basically be expected to provide A-to-Z administrative support. In general, this involves ensuring the office administrative executes in an efficient and organized manner to achieve all daily office requirements. In some cases this could include scope that may overlap other contractor support activities, but more constrained in terms of the administrative career field. It is expected that all work completed reflect knowledge and understanding of NGA and the home organization, policy and guidance, administrative responsibilities, and business rhythms and processes. Such administrative support would extend across various functional areas (i.e., NGA Front Office, Protocol, Health Clinic, Source, Analysis &amp; Production, Military Support, etc). While similar administrative requirements could be expected across NGA, each office would have unique administrative requirements specific to supporting the mission of that office. ESAS must therefore embrace the necessary flexibility that may be required to accommodate different administrative support needs across the agency.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secretary Services</span></strong> <br />This level of support provides general secretarial support and may be structured into sub-levels (e.g., Secretary vs. Senior Secretary; Secretary Level 1 &amp; 2, etc.). Again, the exact labor category structure is still being defined. In regards to scope effort, the Secretary positions would in general perform an array of clerical and administrative duties with customer service at the forefront. They would maintain a close and highly responsive relationship to the day-to-day activities of the office and staff. NGA offices would expect all work to be completed on-time and fairly independent with minimum guidance in completing secretarial and clerical duties. The following is a list of potential secretary duties that is not all inclusive and therefore should be considered as examples:<br /><br />1. Manage all aspects of office calendars inclusive of scheduling appointments and meetings. <br />2. Perform receptionist and escort responsibilities as required. <br />3. Communicate with leadership, office staff and personnel, as well as visitors to ensure timely execution of responsibilities.<br />4. Prepare reports, memos, letters, and other office documents using word processing, spreadsheets, databases or presentation software. <br />5. Handle routine office situations without little to no assistance.<br />6. Maintain proper files to include establishing and maintaining computer based records/files (e.g. document logs, supply management, personnel information, office expenditures). <br />7. Support office performance reporting responsibilities.<br />8. Retrieve, open mail and control mail distribution. <br />9. Answer telephones and give information to callers, take messages, or transfer calls to appropriate individuals.<br />10. Oversee the planning, scheduling and facilitation of all meeting requirements to include operating Video Teleconference (VTC) sessions, taking meeting minutes, providing post-meeting minutes/reports, recording and tracking actions, and so forth.<br />11. Review documents in accordance with the Agency's correspondence procedures; manage all office correspondence; and track actions such as agency-controlled correspondence. <br />12. Edit and re-format agency-controlled correspondence in accordance with agency procedures. <br />13. Prepare travel itineraries and arrangements (i.e. coordinating itinerary, booking flights, rental cars, accommodations, etc).<br />14. Prepare Read-Ahead Books, Travel Books and other support tools that may be required.<br />15. Maintain PeopleSoft data with periodic updates as they occur or as necessary.<br />16. Provide administrative support to ensure accurate accountability of property management data/equipment. <br />17. Proficiently operate office equipment such as fax machines, copiers, scanners and phone systems; and computer software such as spreadsheet, word processing, database management, and other applications. <br />18. Follow Government furnished directives, instructions, and Standard Operating Procedures, etc. <br />19. Accomplish pre- and post-travel administrative requirements for supporting office.<br />20. Support the on-time completion of office "taskers" both internally and externally using corporate processes and systems. <br />21. Provide administrative support in arranging office functions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Executive Administrative Services<br /></strong></span>The scope of effort at the Executive Administrative level would basically consist of all administrative duties as that of a Secretary, but at a higher level of complexity with shorter timelines, and competing amongst multiple priorities. Note that this level of support may be structured into sub-levels (e.g. Senior Executive Administrator vs. Executive Administrator; Executive Administrator Level 1 &amp; 2; etc.). <br /><br />At the executive administrative support level, contractor personnel would be expected to efficiently support the SES/DISL level personnel and their immediate staff with little to no day-to-day guidance. Executive leadership would expect administrative support to occur with a certain level of autonomy and preciseness. This would include independently solving office problems, supporting overall management of office activities, managing multiple calendars, juggling multiple priorities, executing office actions using corporate applications, making travel arrangements that often involves a dynamic itinerary, conducting basic research, preparing modest reports (e.g. statistical, office), working with databases, spreadsheets and PowerPoint briefing slides, handling information requests, performing clerical functions (e.g. preparing correspondence, copying, arranging documents), receiving and/or escorting senior visitors, and other executive administrative requirements as required. <br />Responses to this notice shall be limited to 5 pages and shall include the following information:<br /><br />(a) Respondent's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address<br />(b) Respondent's interest in bidding on the anticipated future solicitation<br />(c) Respondent's capability to meet personnel requirements to include the number of available personnel with the required clearance level (TS/SCI)<br />(d) Respondent's capability to perform a contract of this magnitude (include work performed within the past 5 years) provide examples<br />(e) Respondent's type of small business and Business Size<br />(f) Respondent's Joint venture, if any - existing and potential<br />(g) Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research<br /><br />The potential requirement would be for one base year plus four one year options. This potential acquisition is expected to be a 100% Small Business Set-Aside if it is determined that there are an adequate number of small businesses who can fulfill this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561110 with a size standard of $7 million. <br /><br />Interested parties shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than 09:00 AM (EST) 1 June 2012 . All interested contractors must be registered in the CCR to be eligible for award of Government contracts. Mail, fax or e-mail your response to National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Attn: F.

<SUBJECT>NEUTRON SPIN SUPERMIRROR BENDER POLARIZERS

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing neutron spin supermirror bender polarizers.
<p>NIST operates several neutron beam lines at its NIST Center for Neutron Research which are made available for users from industry, academia, and government laboratories. Many experiments require the use of polarized neutrons for their specific applications. NIST's Neutron Physics Group will be operating the highest neutron flux beam in the US, and the existing polarizing devices are inadequate for this new beam line. Thus, to establish our ability to provide polarized neutrons on this beam line, we must acquire supermirror bender polarizers that are designed specifically for this beam.<br /><br />For the new NG-C fundamental neutron physics beam line, we require a pair (2) of neutron supermirror bender polarizers to polarize and analyze the polarization of the high flux, NG-C neutron beam at the NIST Center for Neutron research. The required devices must cover a large cross sectional area of the beam; they must give a high polarization (&gt;80%) over a large range of neutron wavelengths (0.25 nm to 1.0 nm); the coating must be FeSi (iron-silicon) and cannot contain Co (cobalt) in order to minimize induced radioactivity; and they must come with their own magnetic casing.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the neutron supermirror bender polarizers, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies capable of providing neutron supermirror bender polarizers are requested to email a detailed report describing their capabilities to paula.wilkison@nist.gov no later than the response date shown for this sources sought notice. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:<br /><br />1. Name of the company that provides the devices for which specifications are provided.<br /><br />2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to provide the devices, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).<br /><br />3.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Montana Water Science Center has a requirement for services to be provided for the collection of suspended sediment samples at one (1) site for Yellowstone River near Sidney, Montana.
The USGS has conducted hydrologic data-collection activities in order to estimate seasonal loads of suspended sediment in the Yellowstone River near Sidney, Montana. The surface-water quality monitoring activities includes the collection of suspended sediment samples at one (1) monitoring site at a frequency sufficient to estimate daily, monthly, and seasonal suspended sediment loads.
The USGS is seeking small business sources to provide the following services:
Scope  
Sampling site and methods:
The collection of suspended-sediment samples will occur at the following U.S. Geological Survey=BFs gaging station:
Yellowstone River near Sidney, Montana (06329500)
Each sample will consist of the collection of water in three (3) sample bottles using a depth-integrated single-vertical collection method. Samples will be collected from 3 sampling locations on the river previously identified by the USGS technical liaison, and collection of the sample will occur from a USGS cable way. As such, the contractor must be familiar with the operation of the cable car, and successfully complete a cableway safety training conducted by the USGS within 5 days of the contract award.  In addition to the collection of a suspended-sediment sample, water temperature and gage readings are also obtained at every sampling visit and recorded on a monthly field form. 
Sampling Frequency: 
A guideline for sampling frequency is a follows:
March (or ice break up) through June:  Once daily (1 sample bottle collected once daily from the three (3) previously identified sampling locations) July through November:  Every third day December through February:  No sample collection
Note: From March through June twice-daily samples during large events may be requested=BFthe contactor will be contacted by phone if additional samples are needed.  During the time period from July to November, the sampling frequency will increase to once daily if the river stage increases by one (1.0) foot or more due to significant runoff or ice breakup. The sampling frequency will return to every third day once the river stage returns to the pre-event stream stage. All determinations of the need to change sampling frequency based on changes in stream stage will be made by USGS project technical liaison.
The USGS is in search of small business firms who are able to provide the above mentioned service.  Small business firms who feel they can furnish the required service or its functional equivalent (based on criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required supply/service stated herein.  This information will be used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Montana Water Science Center has a requirement for services to be provided for the collection of suspended sediment samples at one (1) site for Clark Fork River at Deer Lodge, Montana.
The USGS has conducted hydrologic data-collection activities in order to estimate loads of suspended sediment transported through the Clark Fork Basin.  The surface-water quality monitoring activities includes the collection of suspended sediment samples at one (1) monitoring site at a frequency sufficient to estimate daily, monthly, and annual suspended sediment loads.
The USGS is seeking small business sources to provide the following services:
Scope  
Sampling site and methods:
The collection of suspended-sediment samples will occur at the following U.S. Geological Survey=BFs gaging station:
Clark Fork River at Deer Lodge, Montana (Station ID12324200)
Each sample will consist of the collection of water in two (2) sample bottles (collected sequentially from the same sampling location) using a depth-integrated single-vertical collection method. The sampling location will be previously identified by a USGS technical liaison, and in some instances may require the collection of the sample from the bridge.  In addition to the collection of a suspended-sediment sample, water temperature and gage readings are also obtained and recorded on a monthly field form at every sampling visit. 
Sampling Frequency: 
A guideline for sampling frequency is a follows:
March through June:  Once daily (2 sample bottles collected once daily from the one (1) site) July through February:  Every fourth day
Note: During the time period from July to February, the sampling frequency will increase to once daily if the river stage increases by one-half (0.50) foot or more due to significant runoff or ice breakup. The sampling frequency will be reduced to every fourth day once the river stage returns to the pre-event stream stage. Periodically, twice-a-day samples will be requested to better define extreme or unique hydrologic conditions. All determinations of the need to change sampling frequency based on changes in stream stage will be made by USGS project technical liaison.
The USGS is in search of small business firms who are able to provide the above mentioned service.  Small business firms who feel they can furnish the required service or its functional equivalent (based on criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required supply/service stated herein.

<DESC>The Department of Interior, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) in Herndon, Virginia intends to negotiate and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to Proton Energy Systems on behalf of the National Weather Service (NWS) Alaska Region (AR) for hydrogen generators, spare parts, hydrogen storage tanks, water purification system, and test equipment.
The equipment will be installed at the NWS Service Offices in McGrath & St. Paul, AK the summer of 2012. The AR/SOD staff has one and a half years of experience installing, operating, and maintaining the Proton Energy HOGEN-20 hydrogen generator.  Proton is the only manufacturer of hydrogen generators with the PEM electrolysis process. The fuel cell is proprietary to Proton. NWS uses this fuel cell in Proton generators at several sites in the Pacific Region. NWS has three and a half years of experience with Protons HOGEN-20 at both Sterling Field Support Center at Sterling, VA and WFO Anchorage, AK. Utilizing the same type of equipment will provide consistency in support of agency wide operations. Additionally, installing the same hydrogen generator at this location will simplify maintenance and service calls and reduce the learning curve for regional personnel operating this type of equipment.
AQD will use procedures that provide for issuance of the order on the basis of other than full and open competition that are authorized by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2).  The supplies are highly specialized and market research indicates that the items appear to not be otherwise available to the government.   
This notice is not a formal solicitation. This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 
Information related to the potential availability of other sources that can fulfill this requirement must be received by the POC listed below no later than 5PM eastern time on Friday, May 25, 2012, POC: Corey Gerst, Acquisition Services Directorate, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170. Questions must be emailed to Corey.Gerst@aqd.nbc.gov.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 05/16/2012
Capital Hotel Management, LLC (CHM) At NPS Commercial Services Program (WASO)
As required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.3, authority is herein requested to contract on a sole source basis for travel industry reports to be provided for NPS Commercial Services Program (the Program) in support of National Park Service visitor services. In accordance with 41 U.S.C.  253(c), this justification is submitted to request award of a contract to TravelClick, Inc. of Atlanta, GA, for providing Price Position Reports to assist the Program in monitoring future lodging rates.  
As specified by FAR 6.303-2, Content, the following are the facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited.
(1)	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than Full and Open Competition."
The agency is the U.S. Department of the Interior acting through the National Park Service, NPS Commercial Services Program.  The Contracting activity is the National Park Service WASO-WCP.  This document is a Justification for other than Full and Open Competition.
(2)	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.
The NPS Commercial Services Program must comply with a legal requirement to approve rates in a manner that is "as prompt and unburdensome as possible to the concessioner" and that shall "rely on market forces to establish reasonableness of rates" (PL 105-391, Section 406). The Service is reviewing and testing new processes to ensure that they are achieving these legal requirements.  Contracting with TravelClick would give the Program access to Price Position Reports, which would capture forward looking rates for the NPS lodging properties and their competitive properties. TravelCLICK is the only current source of this information and recently merged with the other previous provider of similar hotel data information, Rubicon. The data captured in these reports looks 365 days into the future, utilizing software to pull this information from multiple sources and channels. The information captured in these reports will ensure that accurate and effective rate monitoring will occur within the Program. 

(3)	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).
The National Park Service is executing a project to update its Concessioner Review and Concessioner Rate Administration Programs.  These programs were established more than 20 years ago and the Service needs to revise these programs to address current NPS needs and align NPS practices with industry practices, where appropriate.  The Standards, Evaluations, and Rate Approval (SERA) Project, began in 2002 and two phases are now complete.  The NPS obtained contractor assistance in each of these efforts.  The NPS needs to continue efforts to update the programmatic elements of the Concessioner Review Program during Phase 3 of SERA.  The cost for this requirement is estimated to be $384,000.00 over a one-year term.
(4)	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.
FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. (2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.
(5)	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.
CHM was the contractor in the previous (SERA) task order (P11PD00100).  CHM has been involved with the SERA requirement since 2002.  The requestor, NPS Commercial Services Program has stated that they would estimate a one year delay in the project should another contractor be selected for this project.   CHM has specific knowledge and experience gained under the prior contract and the work for the next phase is a continuation of the successful previous work.  Selecting a different contractor at this stage of SERA would necessitate considerable time for NPS staff to educate a new contractor on the effort and would cause significant delay in the process to update our Program.  CHM is the only company that is able to support this requirement in a timely manner. 
(6)	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.
Since this requirement will be placed as a task order under an indefinite delivery contract it is not required to be publicized in accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(6).
(7)	A determination by the contacting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
This requirement will be placed as a task order under an IDIQ contract. As such all rates and pricing has been previously competed and determined fair and reasonable.  It is anticipated that the basis for determining fair and reasonable pricing will be to compare it to the independent government estimate and the rates contained in the IDIQ contract.   
(8)	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.
None.  Market Research was not done since this is a follow on requirement.
(9)	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.
None.
(10)	A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
None.
(11)	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.
NPS will continue to monitor and research any and all requirements of this type in the future for possible competition.
(12)	Contracting Officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.
As the approving Contracting Officer, I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC><br>Request for Information - Innovative Pricing for Cultural Services Contracts <br><br>This is a request for information (RFI), not a request for proposals.  The information being requested is information that will assist the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to develop an innovative pricing concept for use with cultural services performance based contracts, for both CONUS and OCONUS.  <br>In the past, task order pricing was established by using pre-negotiated hourly loaded rates (excluding profit) and multiplying these rates with a level of effort.   The Better Buying Initiative has directed the USACE to demonstrate cost savings and/or reductions.  As a result of this initiative, information is being sought from industry on methods of pricing that would be both efficient and effective in meeting the initiative requirements of demonstrating cost savings and reductions.  <br>To assist in understanding any proposed pricing methods responders are asked to provide a narrative explanation of the pricing methodology and demonstrate the application of the methodology by use of a small sample project.  The narrative should clearly demonstrate how savings may be achieved by use of the suggested methodology over the prior method described above.<br>Responses should be sent to Roberta Cromeens via email at Roberta.c.cromeens@usace.army.mil.

This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Government intends to acquire a commercial service using FAR Part 12. Interested parties may submit their quotations and detailed literature outlining specifications by email NO LATER THAN Thursday, 24 MAY 2012 - 5:00 P.M., CST. No verbal responses will be provided. The point of contact for all information regarding this notice is Jamaya Smith, Contract Specialist, 601-634-5248 or Jamaya.Smith@usace.army.mil.<br><br>BACKGROUND:<br>The ERDC-EL is proposing to organize and conduct the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Workshop titled, "Sustainable Cities and Military Installations: Climate Change Impact on Energy and Environmental Security" in Rella, Iceland, 3-6 June 2012. The NATO Workshops are high visibility events bringing together senior experts in sustainable development, climate change, environmental risk assessment, modeling, toxicology, advanced statistical analysis, and regulatory decision making from the USA as well as several European and developing countries. These experts exchange ideas with military commanders and senior policy decision makers from around the globe to help solve current worldwide challenges.<br><br>We propose to organize workshop participants into three working groups, in order to address sustainable development challenges in (A) energy, (B) water, and (C) infrastructure. "State of the Science" reviews synthesized by these working groups, along with other materials developed during the meeting, will provide a foundation for a book that will be published.<br><br>A unique feature of these Working Group proceedings is facilitation and information<br>generation using Mental Modeling techniques. Mental Modeling allows the knowledge and experience of the working group members to be mapped in near real-time. This map(called an expert model) provides an easy visualization of the major issues and concerns in each subject area and a basis for follow-up discussions. Mental modeling facilitation requires topical knowledge in the field of sustainability science as well as knowledge of the US Army Corps and DoD to tailor discussion to the needs of military installations. The expert models developed in each working group will be included in the summary chapters published in the workshop<br>proceedings.<br><br>REQUIREMENTS:<br>Vendor MUST be able to offer Mental Modeling-based facilitation. The facilitation of the Working Grougs are crucial for the success of this workshop.

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>A. INTRODUCTION: Tactical Network Testbed (TNT) Collaboration: <br />This Request for Information (RFI) is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit technology experimentation candidates from Research and Development (R&amp;D) organizations, private industry, and academia for inclusion in future experimentation events coordinated by the U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). USSOCOM invites industry, academia, individuals and Government labs to submit technology experimentation nominations addressing innovative technologies leading to possible Government/Industry collaboration for development of USSOCOM technology capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation will explore emerging technologies, technical applications, and their potential to provide solutions to future SOF capabilities.<br /><br />The final FY12 SOF Experimentation focus area will be conducted on 31 Jul-10 Aug 2012 with the theme being Mobility and Vehicle Protection at Camp Roberts, CA.</p>
<p>SOF experimentation focus areas for FY13 tri-annual TNT events are as follows:<br />- 30 Oct - 8 Nov 2012: Urban Operations at Camp Atterbury / Muscatatuck UTC, IN<br />- 26 Feb - 7 Mar 2013: Digital Soldier at Avon Park, FL<br />- 18-27 Jun 2013: Signature Reduction at Camp Roberts, CA</p>
<p>Additional RFIs will be released to FedBizOpps approximately 75 days prior to each scheduled TNT event to provide additional details.</p>
<p>After review of the technology experimentation nomination submissions, the Government may invite select candidates to experiment their technologies at the USSOCOM &amp; NPS sponsored TNT experimentation event. The TNT venue will provide an opportunity for the submitter to interact with USSOCOM personnel for the purpose of USSOCOM assessing potential impact of emerging technology solutions on USSOCOM missions and capabilities. The intent is to accelerate the delivery of innovative capabilities to the Special Operations Forces (SOF) warfighter. Industry participation in experimentation activities does not suggest or imply that USSOCOM or NPS will procure or purchase equipment.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVE:<br />1. Background: USSOCOM conducts TNT experimentation events in cooperation with NPS at Camp Atterbury / Muscatatuck UTC, IN; at Camp Roberts, CA; and at Avon Park, FL. These cooperative TNT experiments are conducted with representatives from Government R&amp;D organizations, academia, and private industry. TNT experimentation events provide an opportunity for technology developers to interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance SOF capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government, academia, and industry to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and mature technologies for the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of technology discoveries to the SOF warfighter. TNT identifies potential technology solutions, impacts, limitations, and utility to meet SOF technical objectives and thrust areas. Materiel solutions should be at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3 or greater for the purpose of TNT. Experiments may be between a half day and five days in duration and be conducted in unimproved expeditionary-like conditions. At the discretion of USSOCOM, respondents may be asked to complete a vendor loan agreement (see attachment).</p>
<p>2. Experimentation Focus: Experiments will be conducted from 31 Jul-10 Aug 2012, at Camp Roberts, CA. The venue will explore emerging technology solutions for: Mobility and Vehicle Protection. Technology will need to be capable of supporting a SOF unit to provide a revolutionary improvement in SOF small units' vehicle mobility and/or protection. Technology should be at Technology Readiness Level 3 (TRL-3) or greater. Any and all solutions must provide all necessary software and hardware to accomplish the mission. Mobility and vehicle protection systems may include enhancements to armor, survivability, mobility or C4ISR solutions for new vehicles or existing Family of Special Operations Vehicles (FOSOV): Individual - All Terrain Vehicle (ATV); Light - Light Tactical All Terrain Vehicle (LTATV); Medium - Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV); Commercial - Non-Standard Commercial Vehicles (NSCV); and Heavy - MRAP RG-31, RG-33, RG 33 AUV and M-ATV. USSOCOM's interest remains all types of vehicular armor, including opaque, flat transparent, curved transparent, and armor for all platforms (ground, rotary wing, fixed wing, and maritime). Flat and curved transparent armor that is lightweight and thin continues to be a high priority. Advanced technologies supporting mobility solutions for amphibious vehicles, silent, hybrid or increased efficiency propulsion are also of interest.</p>
<p>3. Security Requirements: Vendors should not submit classified information in the technology experimentation nominations.</p>
<p>4. Respondents interested in live fire experiments shall conduct and submit a safety risk assessment. The risk assessment shall address the likelihood and severity of any inherent risks as well as risk mitigation measures required to bring the resultant risk to a low level. The risk assessment shall be submitted as an attachment to the experiment nomination. Reference MIL-STD-882D for instructions and information regarding risk assessments. Also, respondents are responsible for ammunition shipments to include an Interim Hazard Classification and coordination for receipt and storage at Camp Roberts.</p>
<p>5. Other Special Requirements: DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS. SUBMIT TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENTATION NOMINATIONS ONLY. EXPERIMENTATION NOMINATION SUBMITTALS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED WITHIN A 30 DAY SUBMISSION PERIOD DEFINED AS 75-45 DAYS PRIOR TO EACH SPECIFIED TNT EVENT. For the August TNT at Camp Roberts, CA, all submissions must be received no later than 22 June 2012. No contracts will be awarded based solely on this announcement or any subsequent supplemental RFI announcements planned for FY13 TNT events. Vehicles currently in consideration for the Ground Mobility Vehicle 1.1 Solicitation will not be considered for this experimentation event.</p>
<p>C. SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:<br />Technology Experimentation nominations shall be submitted electronically via USSOCOM webpage: http://1.usa.gov/TNTExpNom. Multiple nominations addressing different technology experiments may be submitted by each respondent. Submissions will be reviewed by USSOCOM personnel, support contractors, or NPS Faculty, Staff, or students. Each technology experiment nomination must address only one experiment.<br />Select respondents will be invited to participate in USSOCOM experiments. USSOCOM shall provide venues, supporting infrastructure, and assessment (operational and technical, based on availability of resources and written request) personnel at no cost to invited respondent(s). Respondent's travel costs and technology experiments will be at the respondent's expense. The TNT venue will only supply basic venue infrastructure including frequency allocation and portable power. Invited respondents should prepare to be self-sufficient during experimentation and not dependent on venue resources for success.<br />D. BASIS FOR SELECTION TO PARTICIPATE:<br />Selection of respondents to participate will be based on the extent to which the technology represents a particular class or level of capability that can be provided to Special Operations Forces. <br />Other considerations include:<br />- Technical maturity<br />- Relevance of or adaptability to military operations/missions<br />- Relevance to current operational needs<br />- Relevant to Event Focus Area<br />E. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: All efforts shall be made to protect proprietary information that is clearly marked in writing.

<p>Malm. I-3 WAWF Instructions<br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments.</p>
<p>To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact.</p>
<p>For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988.</p>

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

. DESCRIPTION
Gridstone BRAND prefinished
ceiling panels have a noncombustible,
Fire-Shield G
gypsum core. The 2-mil. white,
stipple-textured vinyl laminate
combines high light reflectance
with easy cleanability.
APPLICATIONS
Gridstone panels are ideal for
interior and unexposed exterior
ceiling applications such as
soffits, parking garages, kitchens
and baths.
Gridstone panels are accepted
by the USDA for use in food
service and food processing
areas.
ADVANTAGES
o Quick, dry installation.
Gridstone Ceiling Panels install
easily in standard exposed
grid systems.
o Fire-resistant. A noncombustible
gypsum core assures fire safety
with 1 1/2- and 2-hour fire
rating achievable depending
on installation.
o Pre-decorated. The sturdy
white vinyl laminate eliminates
additional finishing.
o The product shall be maintained
at a temperature between
60 and 104 Fahrenheit
(16 - 40 Centigrade) and
not exceed 90% relative
humidity prior to, during and
after installation.
LIMITATIONS
o Do not install panels in
areas exposed to extreme or
continuous moisture.
o For exterior application,
protect grid panels from direct
exposure to weather, water
and continuous high humidity.
Under no circumstances
should water be in contact
with the back of the panels.
o Can support 1.6 #/sq. ft. of
insulation.
o Overlaid insulation may cause
excessive panel deflection and
is not recommended where
high humidity is likely to occur.
o Extreme lighting conditions
may distort texture appearance.
o The use of strong organic
solvents (such as ketones), harsh
abrasive cleansers or steel wool
are not recommended. These
materials may cause dulling,
discoloration, softening and
other permanent damage to
the vinyl surface.

Construction Guide
Gridstone ceiling panels are
designed to be mounted
in standard 15/16" exposed
tee grid systems or environmental
type grids for severe
conditions, with grids either
2' by 2' or 2' by 4'. Grid
installation should be
conducted according to
manufacturer's specification.
Each panel must be supported
on all four (4) edges.
Cross ventilation must be
provided in unheated or
enclosed space above
ceiling panels.
RECOMMENDATIONS
General: Install panels in lay-in
suspension systems with edges
concealed by flanges of suspension
members. Cut panels
to fit tightly at borders and
penetrations so that cut edges
are concealed by trim pieces
and escutcheons.

<p>PASS/BASE ACCESS TO THE 106TH RESCUE WING, F.S. GABRESKI ANG</p>
<p>Contractors should be aware that this is a Military Installation and that all access to this installation is granted by the 106 Rescue Wing Security Forces. Prior to making deliveries please contact (631) 723-7478 and follow instructions provided by the Security Forces for access to the 106th Rescue Wing, Gabreski Airport, NY. If a gate pass is not granted to a contractor allowing the delivery of goods, execution of warranty support, or performance of services please contact the contracting officer.<br />A contractor's badge will be issued once the contractor enters the main gate at F.S. Gabreski Airport. Be sure that all of your employees have the proper ID (drivers license, state ID, immigration card, U.S. Passport, etc.). If they do not have the proper ID, they will be turned away.</p>
<p>A list of all prospective contractors (full name, date of birth, social security number, and home address) will be provided to Security Forces by the vendor no less than 21 business days from the date work is expected to start, for the purposes of a criminal history check. Note: All additions, deletions and/or changes to the contractor list provided to security forces will require the 21 work day lead time, unless otherwise agreed upon between Security Forces, Environmental, and Base Contracting, for the purposes of a criminal history check. The following is a guide to who will be allowed access to the installation.</p>
<p>1. All prospective contractors MUST be U.S. citizens or MUST have established and maintain legal residence in the U.S., and be authorized by the US government to work in the United States (i.e. Green card, worker authorization, etc.). All prospective contractors MUST have at least one form of U.S. government issued photo identification (driver's license, U.S. passport, U.S. work visa, etc.) for entry to the installation. Security Forces will review any questionable identification documents for determination as to whether or not said identification is authorized for access to the installation.</p>
<p>2. All prospective contractors, once it has been established that they maintain the appropriate credential as described in paragraph 1 above, are subject to a Criminal History Check. If a prospective contractor is found to have been "arrested" (conviction not required) within the last ten (10) years for any of the following offenses as defined in The New York State Penal Laws: any felony assault; draft evasion; any felony drug charges; Indecent acts or liberties with a child under 16; molestation to include child pornography and sex abuse; kidnapping; manslaughter; murder; rape and related sex offences; robbery; arson; felony criminal mischief; fire arms offences; any grand larceny; burglary and felony larceny charges; any charges related to terrorism; any active warrants from any jurisdiction; and any other offense deemed to be in the best interest of the government to refuse entry to having persons committed them, the prospective contractor will not be allowed legal access to the installation for the purpose of employment, unless otherwise agreed upon by Security Forces, Civil Engineering, Base Contracting, and authorized by the Base Commander.</p>
<p>Note: For the purposes of Contracting services at the 106 RQW, it is implied that, by the contracting agreement, that any and all parties agree to a Criminal History Background Check once entering into any contract with the 106 RQW. Any documents that are provided and found fraudulent to include, but not be limited to driver's licenses, contracting licenses, etc., will result in an arrest and potential termination for default of the contract. All contractors are subject to search in order to obtain entry onto the installation and while working on the installation. Any refusal to submit to a search of their person or vehicle will be deemed as a violent act of aggression against the installation and will be cause for dismissal from the installation and revocation of future privileges and installation access.</p>
<p>A contractor's badge will be issued once the contractor enters the main gate at F.S. Gabreski Airport. Be sure that all of your employees have the proper ID (drivers license, state ID, immigration card, U.S. Passport, etc.). If they do not have the proper ID, they will be turned away. The U.S. Government will not be held liable for any delays or breach of contract caused by refusal of the 106th RQW Security Forces.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING PROCURED UTILIZING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.<br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51.
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being procured using full and open competition.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Energy and Environment Division's Engineering Laboratory Indoor Air Quality and Ventilation Group currently has the capability to count airborne levels of particles with diameters less than 10 nm using a scanning mobility particle spectrometer (SMPS). The group's research efforts in this area are based on the face that there are many sources of particles found indoors and outdoors that generate particles in this size range and that these small particles have potential human health consequences and are in need of further study.</p>
<p>The experimental program has outgrown the existing SMPS and a new system is needed to conduct future studies to determine source emission rates, penetration coefficients, deposition rates, and filtration removal efficiencies of these smaller particles. The scanning mobility particle spectrometer (SMPS) consists of an electrostatic classifier that produces a highly monodisperse, submicrometer aerosol using a nano differential mobility analyzer that generates particles in the range from 2 to 150 nm, along with a water-based condensation particle counter.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking a high resolution nanoparticle sizer to measure airborne particle size distributions employing a spectrometer to directly measure number concentrations without assuming the shape of the particle size distribution and using a method that is independent of the refractive index of the particle or fluid.</p>
<p>All items must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) each, High resolution nanoparticle sizer that must meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>&bull; High resolution data - up to 167 channels<br />&bull; Broad size range - from 2.5 nm to 1,000 nm<br />&bull; Fast measurements - complete size distributions in 16 seconds<br />&bull; Wide concentration range from 1 to 107 particles/cm3<br />&bull; Computer automated flow control <br />&bull; ISO 15900:2009 compliant particle sizing method</p>
<p>1) The nanoparticle size must include the following subsystems, which are described below:</p>
<p>&bull; Electrostatic classifer (DMA)<br />&bull; Water-based condensation particle counter<br />&bull; All required accessories, cables and software</p>
<p>2) Must include an electrostatic classifier that produces a highly monodisperse, submicrometer aerosol using a nano differential mobility analyzer (DMA) that generates particles in the range from 2 to 150 nm. <br />The DMA must employ a high activity aerosol neutralizer for general-purpose applications involving highly charged aerosols and low flow rates. This aerosol neutralizer will need to have a radioactivity level of about 370 MBq (using a Kr-85 source) and a maximum flow rate of 5 L/min.</p>
<p>3) The system must also include a water-based condensation particle counter (CPC) that utilizes state-of-the art water based condensation technology. This CPC must have less than 0.1 second rise time and a high sample flow rate for low diffusion losses and low Poisson noise. Other important elements include a thermodynamically optimized growth region and enhanced optical and detection design for good signal to noise ratios.<br />&bull; 2.5 nanometer detection <br />&bull; Single particle counting to 4 x 105 particles/cm3<br />&bull; &lt; 100 millisecond rise time response <br />&bull; Sheath flow with high aerosol flow rate for enhanced counting statistics <br />&bull; 1&frasl;10th second data reporting <br />&bull; Built in Ethernet capability<br />&bull; Color touch screen with graphical interface</p>
<p><br />4) The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, a one year warranty period for the system. Warranty work shall be completed on-site at NIST or at the Contractor's site, at the discretion of the Contractor. All costs and responsibilities associated with parts, labor, travel and shipping shall be covered under the warranty. The warranty shall commence upon final acceptance by the Government.</p>
<p><br />Delivery Requirements</p>
<p>Delivery, installation, training, and demonstration of performance specifications shall be in accordance with contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.</p>
<p>Final Acceptance (See also FAR 52.212-4(a))</p>
<p>Final acceptance shall be provided upon successful completion of all of the following: Delivery, installation, training and demonstration of all performance specifications.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement", 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. Technical capability and past performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal to price. If Technical Capability and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>A) Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate that the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. Quoters shall also include product literature which addresses all specifications &amp; clearly documents that the product offered meets or exceeds the specifications identified herein.</p>
<p>Note: If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain technical requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.</p>
<p>B) Past Performance:</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product &amp; service provided and the Contractor's history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables. Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history.</p>
<p>Offerors should provide a list of 3-5 references to whom the same or similar equipment has been provided within the past 3 years. Past performance references must include the company/organizations name, contact person, phone number, and e-mail address.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to conduct a full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.102(c) for a Small Form Factor (SFF) Transponder that will provide identification, position, and surveillance reporting in response to challenges from airborne, ground based, and surface interrogators. NAVAIR does not intend to use the provisions of FAR Part 12 for this acquisition. The SFF Transponder must meet the existing AIMS 03-1000A with Changes 1, 2, and 3 (ATCRBS/IFF/Mark XIIA Electronic Identification System and Military Implementation of Mode S) baseline requirements. The SFF Transponder physical dimensions must be less than or equal to 240 cubic inches in size, less than 7 pounds in weight, and nominally consume less than 30 watts of power. The SFF Transponder must provide MIL-STD-1553 and RS-485 Interfaces and must provide Discrete Gillham altitude inputs. The SFF Transponder must meet the environmental requirements of Aeronautical Design Standard ADS-71-SP, the electromagnetic interference and power requirements of ADS-37 and MIL-STD-704A-F, and the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out Performance requirements of DO-260B. The SFF must be DO-17B, level C software and DO-254, level C firmware compliant.<br />The SFF contract, awarded as a result of this full and open competition, will contain fixed price incentive fee line items for the nonrecurring development of the SFF, support of Government testing of the SFF, and the attendant technical data. The contract will also contain firm fixed price option line items for up to ten early production units for first article/pre-full rate production testing and a production quantity of up to 500 units. Initial production unit delivery must meet a 1 October 2014 delivery deadline with follow-on deliveries through 2017 of up to 14 units per month. NAVAIR anticipates making award of the SFF contract no sooner than 30 June 2013.<br />The request for proposal (RFP) to be issued for the SFF full and open competition will contain the following pass/fail requirements: offeror must be capable of using an NSA certified US Crypto appliqu&eacute;; offeror must have a valid/current U.S. COMSEC account; and Offeror must be capable of obtaining a Stage 3 Frequency Authorization no later than 30 June 2013. Offerors whose proposals fail to demonstrate compliance with any of these pass/fail requirements will be ineligible for award of the SFF contract.<br />RFP documents (except for the SFF Specification) will be posted to the publicly assessable NAVAIR Homepage. The SFF Specification is marked with Distribution Statement D; as a result the SFF Specification is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors located in the United States (U.S.) who possess a current and valid U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities. As a result of this constraint, foreign contractors may NOT participate in the SFF effort as a prime contractor. Foreign firms who wish to participate in the SFF acquisition must do so as a subcontractor to a U.S. contractor who meets the facility clearance and safeguarding capability requirements noted above. Any such subcontracting arrangement between a U.S. contractor and a foreign firm (to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S. firms) shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy, and shall require the prior approval of the Procuring Contracting Officer and the NAVAIR Foreign Disclosure Officer.<br />For the attention of all interested parties, please be informed that pre-decisional preliminary acquisition planning for this effort was discussed with attending interested parties during a recent Army Aviation IFF Update Briefing. During that event, prospective RFP release dates and site visit plans were addressed that were incorrect. NAVAIR is the procurement authority for this acquisition and all parties are hereby advised that NAVAIR has not yet established an acquisition schedule or determined if site visits will be necessary. All relevant releasable information regarding this acquisition will be released by the NAVAIR Contracting Officer. Firms interested in competing for the SFF effort should contact Ms. Mary Dodds at Mary.Dodds@navy.mil [phone number (301) 757-7083] to register for future SFF correspondence. Please provide point of contact information for your firm to include name, phone number, and e-mail address. Please also provide your Cage code.<br />

BASIS OF EVALUATION

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.  Evaluation of proposals will be based on price and non-price factors, with contract award to be made to the offeror submitting the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal to the Government.
  The factors of Offeror Experience and Past Performance are of equal weight and when combined, are significantly less important than price.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors:  

Factor 1 - Offeror Experience 
Factor 2 -  Past Performance

The distinction between experience and past performance is experience pertains to the types of work and volume of work completed by a contractor that are comparable to the types of work covered by this requirement, in terms of size, scope, and complexity.  Past performance relates to how well a contractor has performed.  

PRICE EVALUATION

The Government will evaluate total price for the basic requirement together with any option(s) exercised at the time of award in accordance with FAR 52.217-4 Evaluation of Options Exercised at Time of Contract Award.
  Analysis will be performed by the following techniques to ensure a fair and reasonable price: (1) Comparison of the proposed prices received in response to the solicitation; and (2) Comparison of proposed prices with the Independent Government Estimate.  Unrealistically low (or high) proposed prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement, or has made an unrealistic proposal.

FACTOR 1, OFFEROR EXPERIENCE:

Solicitation Submittal Requirements:  The Offeror shall submit the following with their proposal:

1)	Submit recent and relevant project experience similar in scope, dollar value, and complexity to the work in the RFP.
  Use the format in Exhibit 1 (Offeror Experience Project Data Sheet) to submit projects for evaluation under experience.  Do not exceed ten (10) pages total for this factor.

i.	Submit a maximum of three (3) projects for the Offeror.
ii.	Submit projects completed within a five-year period. The five-year period is calculated by counting back five years from the date set for the receipt of proposals in the RFP.

2)	All projects submitted which are outside the five-year period or above the maximum number allowed for consideration will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation.  All projects submitted which are not relevant in scope will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation.  Offerors who submit relevant projects for a subsidiary, satellite office, parent company, or predecessor company must fully explain how this office will participate in this contract.
 If it is not clear how this office will participate in this contract, the project will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation.

Basis of Evaluation:  The Offerors experience will be evaluated based upon demonstrated experience similar in scope, dollar value, and complexity to the work in the RFP.

FACTOR 2, PAST PERFORMANCE:

Solicitation Submittal Requirements:  The Offeror shall submit the following with their proposal:

1)	The Past Performance Questionnaire included as Exhibit 2 is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes in its proposal for Offeror Experience similar in size and scope to the project.  Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.
  

2)	The Offeror is responsible for obtaining completed Past Performance Questionnaires to be submitted with their proposal.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference previously submitted Past Performance Questionnaires for other RFPs; however, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted Past Performance Questionnaire information in the past performance evaluation.

i.	Submit a maximum of three (3) projects for the Offeror.
ii.	Submit a narrative, not to exceed two (2) pages, of any terminations for default received and the reason for the termination (if applicable).

3)	If you are submitting a project that your firm performed as a subcontractor, the prime contractor may be cited as the client POC.

Basis of Evaluation:  The Offerors past performance will be evaluated based upon client satisfaction on recent relevant projects within the last five (5) years.
  Client satisfaction will be measured based upon quality of work, effectiveness of management, timely completion of work, and compliance with safety standards.  Additionally, the Offerors contract history must demonstrate relevant knowledge in terms of landscape practices and tree planting, working with tropical terrestrial flora, and general knowledge of all safety and environmental requirements associated with the work they perform.  Further, as an integral part of client satisfaction, the Offerors termination for default history and safety record will also be evaluated.

The Governments sources of information for evaluating past performance may include, but are not limited to, any and all information provided by the contractor, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offerors proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.
  While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.

NOTE: No rating will be assigned if the offeror has no record of relevant past performance or information on past performance is not available.  The rating is considered neither favorable nor unfavorable.

DEFINITION OF ACCEPTABILITY::

ACCEPTABLE: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. The offerors experience and past performance meet or exceed performance and capability standards for the project.  The proposal may have weaknesses, but contains no deficiencies.

UNACCEPTABLE: Proposal clearly does not meet minimum requirements of the solicitation.
  The offerors experience and past performance do not meet performance and capability standards for the project.  The proposal contains deficiencies resulting in increased risk of unsuccessful contract performance.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC>This&nbsp;solicitation announcement is&nbsp;for multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contracts to provide construction services to the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Task orders will be FFP.
<p>NIST has facilities located in Boulder, Colorado and Wellington, Colorado. These locations consist of approximately 30 separate buildings totaling approximately 650,000 square feet, which consist of scientific research laboratories and clean rooms, warehouses, machine shops, maintenance shops, a central utility plant, administrative offices and conference/auditorium facilities, along with radio transmission sites. The age of the facilities ranges from the late 1950s to present day, state of the art technology and construction. The NIST is seeking qualified firms to provide construction services, with emphasis on firms that have general contractor capabilities and experience with multiple-craft construction projects.</p>
<p>Each IDIQ will have a twelve (12) month base period of performance with options for four additional twelve (12) month periods. Each IDIQ contract awarded will have a $3,000 minimum over the life of the contract. The total awarded under all multiple award IDIQ contracts will not exceed $50,000,000 over the life of the contracts.</p>
<p>The proposed contracts are 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this requirement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the size standard is $33.5 million in annual receipts (average annual gross revenue for the last three years.)</p>
<p>It is important to note that, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14, the contractors will be required to perform at least 15% (for general construction) or 25% (for special trade construction) of the cost of contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.</p>
<p>Task order projects may include, but are not limited to, construction/renovation of scientific research laboratory facilities and administrative facilities (offices, operation centers, and warehouses), utilities, electrical systems, water, sewage systems, ADA compliance requirements, safety systems such as fall protection devices/guardrails, solar/energy conservation systems, roofs, communications, security systems, radio transmission towers, HVAC systems, roads, fences, and gates.</p>
<p>Construction activities may consist of, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>1. Construction services including site renovations and renovations of existing labs and offices up to and including the complete strip out of selected areas and the reconstruction of new labs and offices in facilities built as long ago as the early 1950s.</p>
<p>2. Structural demolition and construction including foundations, concrete, steel and other materials used in the construction trades</p>
<p>3. Mechanical demolition and construction including energy conservation, heating and ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, fire protection, alarms, sprinkler systems, special mechanical systems and process systems.

<p>6. The disassembling and reassembling, moving of laboratory/office equipment/furniture, from one area to a new location and or storage during the activities described in the SOW may be required.</p>
<p>All tasks will be performed in and around occupied areas where scientific/research experiments are performed. In many cases, vibration, noise, utility outages, and disturbances to the physical environment will hinder the ability of the Government to perform required activities. <br /><br /><strong>Proposals are due on Monday, June 18, 2012 at 12:00 p.m. Mountain Time</strong>&nbsp;with an anticipated award date of late, July 2012.&nbsp; <strong>EMAIL OR FAX PROPOSALS WILL <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> BE ACCEPTED.<br /></strong><br />The estimated price range of Task Order One is between $100,000 and $250,000.<br /><br />A pre-proposal conference has been scheduled for May 30, 2012 from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. in Building 1, Room 1108 (Auditorium) on the NIST Boulder Campus, located at 325 Broadway in Boulder, Colorado.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED TO ATTEND THE PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE.&nbsp; Email <a href="mailto:Jennifer.malcolm@nist.gov">Jennifer.malcolm@nist.gov</a> with attendees' names and company names&nbsp; to register before 5:00 p.m. May 25, 2012.&nbsp; ALL ATTENDEES MUST BE U.S. CITIZENS.<br /><br /><br /></strong>The Technical data, Specifications and Drawings for Task Order One are attached.&nbsp; If there are any questions regarding this solicitation, please email&nbsp;Jennifer Malcolm at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jennifer.malcolm@nist.gov">jennifer.malcolm@nist.gov</a>.</p>

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI), not a request for proposals.  The information being requested is information that will assist the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to develop an innovative pricing concept for use with cultural services performance based contracts, for both CONUS and OCONUS.  <br>In the past, task order pricing was established by using pre-negotiated hourly loaded rates (excluding profit) and multiplying these rates with a level of effort.   The Better Buying Initiative has directed the USACE to demonstrate cost savings and/or reductions.  As a result of this initiative, information is being sought from industry on methods of pricing that would be both efficient and effective in meeting the initiative requirements of demonstrating cost savings and reductions.  <br>To assist in understanding any proposed pricing methods responders are asked to provide a narrative explanation of the pricing methodology and demonstrate the application of the methodology by use of a small sample project.  The narrative should clearly demonstrate how savings may be achieved by use of the suggested methodology over the prior method described above.<br>Responses should be sent to Roberta Cromeens via email at Roberta.c.cromeens@usace.army.mil. You may also contact by telephone at 817-886-1057.<br>

<AWARDEE>Myron Bowling Auctioneers, Inc., 3901 Kraus Lane, Hamilton, OH 45014 US
<DESC>Contract was awarded under FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.<br /><br />On April 17, 2012, Rita Crundwell, comptroller for the City of Dixon, Illinois, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for wire fraud. Ms. Crundwell was accused of embezzling $53 Million from the City of Dixon. On April 18, 2012, the U.S. Marshals Service was notified by the FBI that Ms. Crundwell's bank accounts had been frozen. The defendant was using embezzled money for the care and maintenance of over 200 horses located in Dixon, Illinois and Beliot, Wisconsin and several additional locations. Since her accounts were frozen, the farm/ranch did not have the means to care for the horses. Farm hands continued to work after this date even though they were unsure if they would receive payment. If the farm hands were to walk off the job, there would be no means to care for the horses. In addition, weekly deliveries of hay and grain would cease. The USMS issued purchase orders for hay and grain deliveries to continue until a contract award could be made for the management and care of the horses. The government recognized that there was an immediate need to care for the animals. If a contract was not awarded immediately, the lives of the horses would be at risk.
