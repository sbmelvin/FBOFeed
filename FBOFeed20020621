<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-63

<ARCHDATE>07132002
<CONTACT>Capt Antoinette Ingram, Business Manager, Phone (310) 336-4053, Email antoinette.ingram@losangeles.af.mil - Ms Judy Parnock, Procuring Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 336-4214, Email judy.parnock@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Program office, is contemplating negotiating a contract modification with Delta Launch Services, Inc. (DLS), a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company.  This procurement will add launch services for National Reconnaissance Office Launch (NROL) West Coast Missions NROL-25, NROL-41, NROL-39 and NROL-45 to the existing DLS EELV Initial Launch Services (ILS) contract (FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items). The Government may also elect not to award any launch services as a result of the solicitation. The Request for Proposal will be issued in July 2002 and the four (4) launch services must be awarded by 30 Sep 02.  The first launch is projected for FY04 and the last launch is projected for FY07.

The EELV program is an expendable space launch system that will satisfy the Government portion of the National Launch Forecast (excluding crew-rated or cargo return missions), reduce overall system recurring costs, and maintain or improve the reliability, operability, and capability of current medium through heavy lift systems (heritage launch systems). The EELV system includes, but is not limited to, launch vehicles, facilities, support equipment, and payload integration in support of the launch of spacecrafts for the Department of Defense, Intelligence Community, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Departments of Transportation and Commerce.  As a result of a competitive acquisition held in 1998, the EELV ILS contracts were awarded to Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services, Inc. and Delta Launch Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company, on 16 Oct 98.  The Government has been contracting with these contractors since 1995 for the development of an EELV system and launch services on a limited source basis.  Through competitive down-selections these two firms were proven to be the only two contractors capable of performing the requirements of the EELV Program.  A Justification and Approval Document (J) to contract with only these two sources for EELV launch services was approved on 9 Jun 98.  Amendment 01 to the J was approved on 15 Aug 00 which permits:  (a) Government missions to be awarded with less than full and open competition to either Boeing or Lockheed Martin, and (b) launch services that must be conducted from the West Coast to be awarded on a sole source basis to Boeing.  

Any other interested parties must (1) be U.S. manufacturers as defined in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) Request for Proposal, (2) have demonstrated launch vehicle installed on launch pad and vehicle power-on successfully, and (3) have the capability to meet the program schedule and ability to support the standardization of launch sites. Firms which did not perform under the Low Cost Concept Verification, EMD and Development contracts, and which believe they can compete as prime contractors in the ILS effort are encouraged to submit a statement of capability and qualification (limited to four (4) pages) addressing the above criteria within seven (7) calendar days of this synopsis to:  SMC/MVK, Attn:  Ms Judy Parnock, Contracting Officer, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1467/A-2, Los Angeles AFB, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659.  See CBD announcements posted 5 Aug 97 (W-212 SN104464) and 30 Dec 97 (W-364 SN154623) for further information on the EELV program.  This CBD synopsis is not a formal solicitation.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command Government?s intends to award a sole source contract to General Dynamics, C4 Systems, Taunton, MA for the upgrade of 361 production and fielded Tactical Data Network Servers (DDS). The upgrade of the 361 production and fielded Tactical Data Network Servers (DDS) will increase server capability to better reflect current network technology and industry best-practices through the use of multiple, single-function servers and redundancy.  Upgrades will accommodate new tactical applications that provide the expected level of service to the Marine Corps Operating Forces.  The upgrade will require the development and integration of a server transit case with up to three (3) (but not less than 2) RAID-5 servers and a KVM device that satisfy the initial contract requirements for hardware and software interoperability and system warranty with the existing DDSs.  These additional cases will be provided for all MSC-level DDSs (190 systems).  The existing network transit case shall be modified to replace the existing server with a compatible RAID-5 server and integrate it with existing hardware and software for all DDSs without adversely impacting the integrity of the DDSs.  Initially, the replacement server will be provided at the Regimental-level (171 systems).  MSC-level and BN-level DDSs may be modified if and when funds permit.  Production of the original Tactical Data Network Servers (DDS) is currently being provided by General Dynamics C4 Systems on contract M67854-99-C-2059.   General Dynamics C4 Systems is currently providing warranty support that is essential to the Tactical Data Network through FY 05.  Extensive knowledge in integrating the DDSs with the TDN Gateways is critical.  General Dynamics C4 Systems is currently in production of some units.  Delivery of final systems is required to be complete by August 1, 2003. Upgrading the systems before fielding will greatly enhance the Marine Corps? ability to support its tactical networks in a timely manner.  The effort includes the updating of training materials, technical drawings and IETMS to reflect any changes.  System modification instructions are acceptable for Marine Corps units to upgrade fielded systems? network transit case if the upgrading by Marine Corps units does not affect the existing warranty. Interested parties must submit a written capability statement in sufficient detail to enable the Marine Corps to determine their capability to perform the effort.

<DESC>NA THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  DO NOT REGISTER.   THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SOLICITATION.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION R EQUESTS.   The Jacksonville District of the US Army Corps of Engineers is planning a procurement for a spillway gate at Western C-11, Phase 2 Spillway 381, Broward County, Florida.  The project goal of the structure when it is closed to flow is to separate the Wester n C-11 canal and act as a divide to facilitate seepage collection and return seepage to the natural area.  The canal reach to the west is used to collect and return seepage from the natural area.  The canal reach to the east is urbanized.  During rainfall events in the basin the structure is operated to allow flow from east to west.  Under this condition the structure head loss or head drop should be minimized (no more than .04 feet) in order to avoid adverse impacts to the urbanized areas of the structure.     At this time the Government intends to specify a gate manufactured by Obermeyer.  The Obermeyer gate has the following desirable characteristics: ·	Accurate water level control even under power failure conditions.  ·	Modular design that simplifies installation and maintenance.  ·	Unlike steel spillway gates, gates are supported for their entire width by an inflatable air bladder, resulting in simple foundation requirements and a cost effective, efficient gate structure.  ·	Thin profile efficiently passes flood flows and debris.  ·	Unlike rubber dams, the steel gate panels overhang the air bladder in all positions, protecting the bladder from floating logs, debris, etc..  ·	No intermediate piers are required.  ·	Spillway gates are less costly to maintain and cheaper to install than other alternatives.  ·	The Spillway gate also has the added benefits of discharging over the top of the gate verses through the bottom of the gate and virtually no risk of manatee mortality due to the gate and air bladder configuration. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to seek alternatives to the Obermeyer gate.  Alternatives must satisfy the following criteria:  a)  Spillway gate design criteria: ·	The spillway gates will fit in the spillway super structure that will have three 30 foot bays.  The spillway structure will pass the design flow of 2880 cubic feet per second (cfs). ·	The optimum design water surface elevation is 4.0 ft-NGVD. ·	The structure invert elevation is –10 ft-NGVD. ·	Top of the gate in the no flow position shall be 5.5 ft-NGVD. ·	Flow can be controlled in each of the three bays independent of each other. ·	Each gated bay is required to be remotely controllable by the operators Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.  This requirement is that the gate also comes with a control system that can be interfaced to a SCADA system. ·	The allowable head drop through the structure at the design flow of 2880 cfs with a headwater surface elevation of 3.5 ft-NGVD shall not exceed 0.05 feet. ·	Discharge of flow shall be over the top of the gate. ·	The gate seals should be effective under the following head condition (4.5 ft-NGVD headwater with a 2.5 ft-NGVD tailwater). ·	The gate seals should be effective under the following reverse head condition (0.0 ft-NGVD headwater with a 5.0 ft-NGVD tailwater). b)  Gates unacceptable to the structure: Wicker gates are bottom hinged steel gates that are raised either manually or by use of hydraulically actuated piston.  The use of a hydraulically actuated piston in the channel would be environmentally risky if a leak occurred which would cause hydraulic fluids to contaminate the canal.  A manually operated wicker gate would be unacceptable, due to the manpower required to make gate changes.  Inflatable dams were also considered for this structure but they have design drawbacks that are also unacceptable in this application.  Inflatable dams require endwall with 45 degrees inclinations in order to get an acceptable seal to stop flow.  This would require a larger structure.  Also, under submerged flow conditi ons the inflatable dam is acceptable to flutter which causes the bladder to rip or destroy itself.  Inflatable dams also have a tendency to sag in the middle thereby making it difficult to accurately control the crest elevation and flow over the crest.  Th ese drawbacks along with higher cost make inflatable dams unacceptable at this structure. NOTE:  THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THE RFI MAY BE USED IN THE GOVERNMENT’S SPECIFICATIONS AND MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL COMPETITORS.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPRIETARY AND/OR BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.  Please mail or fax your written responses to  this RFI to the following address no later than July 8, 2002:  (FAX NUMBER 904-232-2748), USAED Jacksonville District, ATTN:  CESAJ-CT-E (Barbara V.
