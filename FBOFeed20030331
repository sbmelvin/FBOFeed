<SUBJECT>B--Sources Sought for the Development of Ocean Model for Wetting and Drying Simulation in Tidal Areas
<SOLNBR>0103RP72021
<RESPDATE>042303
<ARCHDATE>03302004
<CONTACT>Dick Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>This announcement (0103RP72021) solicits sources for a study in specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Oil Spill Risk Analysis Program, relative to modeling the effects of wetting and drying in tidal areas.   BACKGROUND:  The Minerals Management Service (MMS) recognizes the significance of current circulations in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) regions. Accurate description and simulation of currents in these areas are critical for oil spill risk analysis (OSRA) studies. Many environmental resources in OSRA analysis are located along and/or near the coasts. MMS needs to have ocean models capable of accurately and realistically simulating ocean processes in the coastal areas.  One of the most distinctive features of continental shelf areas is the effect of the tidal currents. A slow tidal flow in the deep sea accelerates over the shallow continental shelf. In shelf regions, maxima tidal currents for each tidal cycle are usually ten times stronger than currents from other sources (wind or convection due to freshwater inputs from rivers). Tidal currents can be the most significant mechanism in transporting spilled oil in the nearshore regime. A complete ocean model requires full consideration of the complex tidal circulation. For example, Cook Inlet, Alaska has tidal ranges in excess of 30 feet, which leads to an extensive area change between wetting and drying as the tidal elevation changes. In addition, the tidal currents in the area can be over 5 knots at the peak. It is necessary to have ocean models that can simulate this kind of wetting and drying changes in the study areas, and to provide better and more realistic currents and water surface elevations for OSRA studies. The present ocean models used in MMS - modified versions of the Princeton Ocean Model - do not have the capability of simulating the wetting and drying variations in tidal areas. It is necessary for MMS to include this important capability into the ocean models.  OBJECTIVES:  The objectives of this study are: 1) based on the models used by MMS (or a model that is comparable), to develop an ocean model that can realistically simulate tidal variations and includes wetting and drying processes in the OCS areas, and 2) to apply the developed ocean model to an area with large tidal variations. The scheme and the model shall be general and robust enough, so that they can be easily implemented into the models used by MMS. More specifically, this study shall (1) develop a numerical scheme that can handle the wetting and drying variations in tidal areas accurately, (2) implement the scheme into an ocean model that is currently used by MMS (or a model that is comparable), (3) design simple cases (up to 5) and use them to test and to verify the new scheme and the model analytically and numerically, and (4) to apply the newly developed model to a particular study area, such as Cook Inlet, to demonstrate the capability of the model and to compare results with previous studies and available data in the same area. The MMS requires the computer source code of the numerical model together with reasonably user-friendly documentation describing the theory, the model, the code architecture, and the operation of the model.  The period of performance of the resultant contract will be twenty-four (24) months, with an estimated cost of $200,000 - $250,000.  IN ORDER TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT, Offerors must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than 3:00PM eastern time, April 23, 2003, a Capabilities Statement describing in detail: (A)The scientific personnel who would be responsible for the collection, interpretation and synthesis of information; (B) The organization's expertise with this type of work and a description of its facilities and resources; and (C) Specific references (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that the organization or key personnel are currently performing or have completed within the past three (3) years. REFERENCES WILL BE CHECKED. Offerors shall submit their Capabilities Statement in original and five (5) copies to Richard P. Bolick , Contract Specialist, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2500, Herndon Virginia 20170-4817. Time of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon, Virginia. CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS WILL BE EVALUATED BASED ON: (A) Experience and expertise of all technical Key Personnel. Particularly relevant is their expertise in the fields of physical oceanography and numerical wave modeling, marine and coastal geology, and other oceanographic disciplines as required, their experience in the type of work proposed, and their demonstrated ability to do the work.  Scientific personnel must collectively demonstrate relevant experience in the appropriate disciplines. Assessment factors will be their qualifications, the relevance of their qualifications to their assigned task, and their estimated level of effort.  The technical personnel who will be responsible for the organization of information, the creation of program architecture, specific code and modeling factors, and the production of documents, manuscripts and programs will also be evaluated. Evaluation factors include: 1. The length and quality of experience for each person assigned to perform specific tasks; 2. The level and quality of formal education in the disciplines and technical fields necessary, examining the level of relevant education attained as well as honors, awards, and recognition of previous work. 3. Experience with similar programs and studies. (B) The Project Manager shall have: (1) experience and demonstrated leadership ability required for the coordination of the study process; (2) experience in managing a multi-disciplinary team and the interdisciplinary processes required for this study; and (3) ability to control costs and to keep project performance and document preparation on schedule.  (C)The organization's history of: (1) successful completion of similar projects (similar in size, scope, complexity, duration, and dollar value); (2) producing high-quality documents; and (3) conducting similar projects on schedule and within budget.  The Capabilities Statement must demonstrate that both the organization and proposed key personnel meet MMS requirements to successfully complete this project. MMS will evaluate the number, size, and complexity of similar projects completed by the proposed project team and the organization, including past performance, to determine the potential for success and contract award.  Past performance consists of adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of cost control, the acceptability of services delivered, the Offeror's willingness to cooperate with the customer in both routine matters and when confronted by unexpected difficulties, and the Offeror's business integrity.  Inquiries will be made of sponsoring organizations.  Only those Offerors demonstrating an ability to successfully perform this project will be asked to submit competitive proposals.  Questions should be faxed to Richard P. Bolick at (703) 787-1022 or e-mailed to richard.bolick@mms.gov. All correspondence should include this RFP number (0103RP72021), full name/company name, address and phone and fax numbers. Requests or questions by telephone are strongly discouraged.

<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service is soliciting Qualification Statements from construction firms desiring to be placed on a list of prequalified design-build general contractors for construction of new or expanded postal facilities in Nevada Sierra District.  This area consists of the State of Nevada and that portion of northern California including all or part of the counties of Modoc, Lassen, Plumas, Sierra, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, and Alpine.  The buildings are expected to range in size from approximately 8,000 square feet to 50,000 square feet, with a construction cost of $1.0 million to $7.5 million, and are categorized as carrier annexes, postal retail facilities, delivery distribution centers, main post offices, stations or branches.  No fixed mechanization is included in these projects. Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of design-build experience and have completed a minimum of two comparable projects in the Nevada Sierra District over the past five years.  Comparable projects for the purpose of this solicitation are defined as design-build new construction or expansion projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities with a minimum of 20,000 square feet in size and a construction cost of at least $2.0 million.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  Experience and references (60%); organization (25%); safety (15%).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  backlog, financial capability, bonding, banking, responsibility and affirmation.  The Postal Service will issue individual project solicitations to prequalified firms only.  Each solicitation will request a fixed price proposal.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Prequalified design/build firms are not obligated to submit proposals in response to a Postal Service solicitation.  Awards of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations. The Postal Service retains the right to:  (1) Delete from the prequalified list any design/build firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award pursuant to the Postal Service Purchasing Manual. (2) Prequalify additional design/build firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be constructed and/or expanded.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition. (3) Issue open-market solicitations for specific design/build projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  This list of prequalified firms will have periodic maintenance for adding/deleting firms as required with a minimum review by the end of November of each year.  Qualification Statement packages may be obtained by sending an email request to gzipagan@email.usps.gov or nyoung@email.usps.gov.  Qualification Statement packages will be emailed to the requestor.

<DESC>N00164-03-R-6615 - Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Technology Improvements in Communication Signal Collection, Evaluation, Analysis, Integration, and/or Interpretation --Technology Improvement – FSG 58 – NAICS 334220 Issue Date: 28 March 2003  – Closing Date: 30 September 2003  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) is interested in receiving innovative proposals for improvements in the collection, evaluation, analysis, integration, interpretation, exploitation, and/or attack of all types of communication signals. The proposals can be based on improvements to existing products, techniques and/or processes or the development of innovative products, techniques and/or processes to advance this area of interest. The proposals must focus on innovative products, techniques, and/or processes that are easily transportable. This notice constitutes a Broad A gency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of six months from the date of publication. NSWC Crane encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, Hub-zone small business, woman-owned small business, and veteran-owned small business concerns. Typically each proposal selected may be: (1) funded for periods up to two years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) funded between $20,000 to $750,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area; (4) NSWC Crane is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) NSWC Crane seeks proposal s for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation. Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding.  In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically. The white paper must be accompanied by a title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost,  and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work. The Government reserves the right to request a proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award. Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail.  White papers (and proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential  relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) realism of the proposed costs and the availability of funds. These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significant ly more important than price. Based on evaluation of the white papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NSWC Crane using the above noted evaluation criteria. An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible businesses may submit a proposal. White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  Please send white papers and proposals via e-mail to wathen_m@crane.navy.mil mail or regular mail to Commander, ATTN: Ms. Mary Ann Wathen, Code 1164, Building 64, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5011. Please refer to BAA number N00164-03-R-6615 in all correspondence and communications.

<DESC>NOTE:  THIS IS A REVISION TO SYNOPSIS MARCH 20, 2003 FOR THE SAME PROCUREMENT.  THE ONLY CHANGE IS CHANGING THE NAICS CODES TO 236, 237, 238.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms with bona-fide places of business in the North Florida District of the Small Business Administration. The Navy is targeting the issuance of additional Blanket Ordering Agreement's, (BOA's). The estimated period of performance will be three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703 (c). BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA Holders will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On a semi-annual basis, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of: (a) usefulness and need for service, and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only (Design/Build), to the BOA holders for submission of a proposal. If the parties come to an agreement, a contractual document (task order) will be issued and the BOA holder will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the task order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. Competition for the BOA task orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA District noted in this synopsis. However, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $100,000.00 that can be placed on a task order with a maximum of $3,000,000. A project could be awarded at an amount less than $100,000.00, if all parties are in agreement. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a Best Value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the BOA holder or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the BOA Holders only. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types: EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc., exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems, HVAC and others.

DESIGNBUILD: On - site design solutions for emergency calls and DesignBuild Services for minor construction items. The SIC/NAICS Codes covered under the BOA for work performed in the NAICS Groups 236, 237, and 238 for construction. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military installations within the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC) Pensacola area of responsibility, including NAS Pensacola, NAS Whiting Field, Corry Station, Outlying Landing Fields (OLF).. The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years. The agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued thereunder. If a firm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the agreement holder and the agreement will terminate. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. The agreement holders may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The average range will be from $100,000.00 to a maximum of $3,000,000. .

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award a contract for a program entitled, Pediatric Off-Patent Drug Study (PODS) Center – Lorazepam – Status Epilepticus. To improve knowledge of safety, efficacy and optimal therapeutic use of off-patent drugs in pediatric populations, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) of 2002 outlines a process whereby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in consultation with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), may issue a Written Request for a particular drug to all holders of approved applications [innovator and abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) holders] for drugs approved under section 505 of the Act.  If no sponsor agrees to conduct the studies within 30 days of the request, the NIH, in consultation with FDA, will publish a request for contract proposals to conduct studies described in the Written Request (in some instances additional studies will be requested).  The FDA did not get responses from current sponsors concerning the use of Lorazepam to treat status epilepticus in pediatric populations.  Therefore, the NICHD will proceed with a contract(s) for the conduct of the necessary clinical trial.

The contract(s) will be awarded to entities that have expertise in conducting pediatric clinical trials, including qualified universities, hospitals, Contract Research Organizations (CROs), federally funded networks (such as the Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit Network, the Neonatal Network, the Maternal Fetal Medicine Network, and others), and other public or private institutions.  The structure that is spelled out here will be used for other pediatric clinical trials for other drugs that fall under the BPCA guidelines.  The study sites will be called Pediatric Off-Patent Drug Study (PODS) Centers.  Lead academic centers, which subcontract to other clinical sites, pediatric clinical trials networks, CROs, and single academic centers are all eligible for contract awards depending on the overall qualifications, experience in pediatric drug trials, type of drug under study, specific drug indication and access to target pediatric populations. 

A single, competitively awarded BPCA Coordinating Center (BPCA-CC) will perform the logistical and technical support to handle all of the data, and assist the NICHD as needed in the administration of the various multi-site networks of clinical centers (the PODS Centers) for each drug that will be studied. The BPCA-CC will also prepare and submit to the FDA all data from the studies conducted by the PODS Centers and the necessary documentation in the form of a Final Study Report to support labeling of the drugs studied.  The BPCA-CC will ensure that the PODS Centers (and its subcontractors, if any) adhere to the study protocols for the drug to be studied.  The activities conducted by the BPCA-CC will support both data collection and evaluation prior to submission of the Final Study Report to the FDA.   An RFP has been issued for award of the BPCA-CC, but no award has been made to date.

The PODS Centers will be funded by competitively awarded contracts to study off-patent drugs.  Individual contracts will be awarded to clinical organizations, the choice of which will depend on the specific drug to be studied, the particular indication for use and the specific pediatric studies to be conducted.  Thereby, studies for specific drugs/indications will be focused at specific PODS Centers, although some PODS Centers could be sites where more than one drug or drug indication will be studied.  It should be noted that while the PODS Centers will be awarded based on the needs for a particular drug and indication, the BPCA-CC will remain unchanged for the life of that particular contract. 

Offerors who will be responding to the subject Request for Proposal (RFP) will be requested to develop study protocols involving the use of lorazepam for status epilepticus in pediatric populations according to the specifications listed in the Statement of Work, which includes the FDA’s Written Request.  After an award has been made, the successful offeror(s) shall meet with staff of the NICHD, BPCA-CC and the FDA in order to agree on the final set of protocols to be implemented in the pediatric populations to be studied, and to provide materials needed for FDA IND approval for the studies.

The required service is defined as code 541990 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or before, April 9, 2003 through the web site at http://FedBizOpps.gov .  All responses must be submitted on or before July 14, 2003, to: Virginia A.

Fully electronic copies will not be accepted, but portions of the proposal may be provided on disc.  The reference number to be used for this announcement is:  RFP NICHD-2003-10.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Fogarty International Center (FIC), Division of International Training and Research, intends to negotiate with White Point Systems, Inc. a cost-reimbursement, completion type professional services contract to develop the systems and staff a center for collection and analysis of scientific data from grantees. 

The International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG) Program is a research grants program to integrate the goals of drug discovery from natural products, biodiversity conservation, and economic development within multidisciplinary collaborations between United States investigators and researchers in developing countries. The FIC currently uses the Natural Products Information System (NAPIS, a proprietary product of White Point Systems), a natural products relational database. to track data collected by the ICBGs. FIC currently has a purchase order type agreement with White Point Systems, Inc to assemble a "snapshot" of research results using NAPIS containing selected field, bioassay, and chemical data collected during the first nine years of this program. 

This contract is to establish a Global Data Center (GDC) to maintain a global dataset for the ICBG Program built upon the snapshot produced in the previous contract, to provide relevant research informatics support to the grantees, and to assemble and coordinate diverse research and outreach activities from grantees. A unified relational database linking all steps of the data pipeline from material collection to drug discovery has significant advantages for data analysis and decision support for the grantees.  Combining each individual project dataset into a Global Database has advantages for oversight and management of the research by the FIC and the Interagency ICBG Technical Advisory Group, and enables a global analysis of the aggregate data, achievements and lessons learned from the Program.  This data support service is available from only one source, i.e., White Point Systems, Inc.  The contractor shall: 1) provide licenses for NAPIS Laboratory and NAPIS Enterprise; 2) conduct a requirements analysis for use of NAPIS by the grantees; 3) develop software to support consolidation of research data; 4) provide training on the use of NAPIS; 5) collect scientific data; 6) provide informatics support for data mining and decisions; 7) conduct scientific data analysis; and 8) collect and maintain information on research, meetings, publications, and outreach activities from grantees to share across projects.

The statutory authority for this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) 1 as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  If, however, there are any responsible sources who feel they possess the abilities which would enable them to perform this project, they may submit a proposal which will be considered by NIH.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with BINET, Inc., Boulder, CO, for analysis of data gathered by the Doppler on Wheels (DOW) radar as part of an Army Homeland Defense Chemical Defense Umbrella Project test. ***  The DOW is a unique 3-cm atmospheric research radar.  Configured for the Army Homeland Security Test, it possesses high power output (250 kW), narrow beamwidth (0.93 deg), very short gate spacing (12 m), and highly sensitive (high gain)  receiver settings.  These characteristics are very different from most other atmospheric research and operational radars.  For instance, the WSR-88D research radar at NSSL has gate spacing of 250 m, and the all other WSR-88D radars have gate spacing of 1 km...these settings are 20 to 80 times larger than the DOW.
Other such examples exist with all other radars and their settings. The unique DOW settings are needed for the nature of the Homeland Security Experiment.  The simulated bio/chemical releases are narrow plumes with weak reflectivity at low heights above the ground.  Radar returns from the releases can be confused with radar returns from the ground, from insects and birds, and
from naturally existing atmospheric refractive index gradients.  Great experience and skill will be needed to interpret the DOW radar returns to determine information about the simulated releases.  The only person qualified to interpret this new and unique data is Dr. Josh Wurman.  Dr. Wurman designed the DOW and possesses a unique level of experience and expertise in the interpretation of DOW results, and predictions of how other radars might perform in future operational systems. ***  This procurement is being conducted under the authority of  FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  No solicitation is planned.  Any responses to this notice must specifically address relevant vendor capabilities in detail and will be evaluated solely to determine whether or not it is in the Government's best interest to conduct a competitive procurement.  FAR provisions are available online at http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  The anticipated award date is April 23, 2003.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Laura St. John, 928-328-6124
<DESC>NA The following questions and answers are issued in response to technical questions received in response to solicitation DABJ49-03-R-0014. Q1) Under Specifications/Salient Characteristics reference is made to 64 or 128 channels.  Under Operating Capability, reference is made to 154 channels, and under Sensors, it says 48 channels.  Please clarify the number of channels required. / This line s pecifies a minimum 64 differential channels with 128 desired, 7(d) and (e) refer to 154 channels, 10 (a) identifies 80 channels for accelerometers, 10(b) identifies 32 channels for strain, 10 (c) and (d) each identify 8 channels, 13 specifies minimum syste m requirements of 48 combined strain and accelerometer channels.  Could you clarify the channel requirements? A1) Minimum is 48.  There is no maximum. Q1a)  The requirement for 64 to 128 synchronous sampling channels which including extra required channels could equal up to 154 channels would not allow for multiplexing. This is because for the highest resolution, 16 bits at a 50K/second rate will require  a pre-amplifier or a signal conditioner, and Analog to Digital conversion for each channel.  In spite of the fact that we could customize and economize on space, these requirements would still require a large, potentially awkward, massive modular unit.  M ight you consider some limited multiplexing?   A2a) No.  Per number 13 of the specification, only 48 channels are required as a minimum. Q2) The specifications in several places make mention of computational event marker channels or, remote event markers.  Are these digital inputs to the data acquisition system? Please define the nature of these markers and their characteristics; A2) Computational implies that an Arithmetic (+,-,x,/) equation (entered by user) or Boolean (for digital inputs) may be applied to the numerical value that is being read by the system on a particular (or multiple is acceptable) channel.  Event refers to t he condition when the system detects that a digital input has occurred or a particular (or multiple) analog channel has reached a user entered value. Q3)  Thermocouple Channels; The specification makes no reference to cold junction compensation for these channels. Will the user provide this? A3)  No, the system shall. Q4) Regarding strain gage measurements, is a 4-wire input satisfactory or, is something more required e.g., 6-wire or 8-wire configuration? A4) Strain gage inputs only require 2-wire inputs. Q5) For the temperatures, does this need to be a thermocouple input?  If yes, does it need to support a range of thermocouple types?  If a thermocouple is not required, can the vendor offer to support semiconductor based temperature sensors (for example: D allas DS1822 or DS1921 H/Z)?  What is the range and resolution required? A5) Yes a type T or K (both needed) thermocouple input.  The ranges for type T and K are industry standards (for K -270 to 1372 degrees Celsius and for T -270 to 400 degrees Celsius).  Resolution should be one microvolt. Q6) For strain gage channels, does the unit need to have internal bridge completion for ¼ bridge sensors? A6) Yes Q7) Are sensors to be included with the delivered system?  If so, in what quantities? / Is the contractor to provide the sensors, or just make provision for them in the DAS?    A7)  No, sensors are not to be included with the delivered system.   Q8) Shock specifications for hard disk drives typically use a 2 ms shock duration.

SECTION C:  White Paper Preparation Instructions

1.  General Instructions:  

a.  Offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision of FAR 52.215-1(e) Instructions to Offerors--Competitive Acquisition. Offerors should consider proposal instructions contained in the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry, which can be accessed on line at www.wrs.afrl.af.mil/contract. This guide was specifically designed to assist offerors in understanding the PRDA/BAA proposal process. White Papers must be valid for 60 days and must reference the above announcement number.  Offerors must submit one original and three (3) copies of their White Papers.  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the government.  The cost of preparing White Papers in response to this PRDA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting or any other contract; however, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.

2.  White Papers:  		

a.  Page Limitation: 5 pages per advanced demonstrator (total of 15 pages), 10 pitch or larger, double spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches.  This limitation includes all information, e.g., indices, photographs, foldouts, appendices, attachments, etc.  It does not apply to the offeror’s proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW), which is limited to 6 pages (2 pages per demonstrator). The government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation. 

	b.  The White Papers shall include a discussion of the nature and scope of the technical approach.  As a separate Volume, which will be in addition to the White Paper page limitation, provide additional information on prior work in this area, descriptions of available equipment, data and facilities and resumes of personnel who will be participating in this effort.  This volume shall include a CSOW detailing the technical tasks proposed to be accomplished under the proposed effort and suitable for contract incorporation and a 1-page Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of cost.  Do not include any proprietary information in the SOW.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry referenced above to assist in SOW preparation. 

         c.  The evaluation of the White Papers shall consider technical aspects and cost factors as they relate to each demonstrator effort.  The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the relative merit of the technical approach proposed for each demonstrator in response to the announcement. The technical aspect ranks as the first order of priority and it shall be evaluated on the following criteria which are equal in order of importance:
 	  
(1)   (50%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor's Statement of Work (CSOW).    Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        
(2)   (50%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated. 
d. Any questions concerning the technical White Papers or SOW preparation shall be referred to the Contracting POC  cited above. 

SECTION D: Basis for Award:  This section shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror’s proposal (both technical oral presentation and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the announcement. While cost is a significant factor, the technical aspect, is ranked as the first order of priority and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are of descending importance:
      
1.  Technical:  

a.  (40%) Soundness of offeror’s approach, including proposed Contractor’s Statement of Work (CSOW).  Offeror must state how each required characteristic of the demonstrators will be achieved and how the proposed schedule can be met.        

b.  (40%) Lightweight and creative solutions.  Use of technology to reduce weight and size will be evaluated.  The proposed weight and size of each demonstrator will be evaluated.  

c.  (20%) The offeror’s past experience with the technology, including personnel and related manufacturing facilities.
    
2.  Cost/Business Proposal:  This paragraph shall apply ONLY to those offerors whose White Papers are selected to proceed to Step Two in this process.

          a.  COST/PRICE:  Separate the proposal into a business section and cost section. Adequate price competition is anticipated.  The business section should contain all business aspects to the proposed contractual or instrument arrangements, such as type of contract/instrument, any exceptions to terms and conditions of the model contract, any information not technically related, etc.  Provide rationale for exceptions. Cost proposals have no limitations; however, offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to 10 pages as a goal.  The proposal shall be furnished with supporting schedules and shall contain a person-hour breakdown per task.  Refer to the AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide for Industry for detailed proposal instructions.  Offerors should provide a separate cost proposal for each advanced demonstrator and an overall cost proposal for the entire effort, if desired.  Offerors are reminded the effort has a 50:50 cost share approach.  The offeror should clearly show what portions of the effort will be funded by the Government and what portions will be funded by the offeror.  

b.  Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.  Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the second order of priority.  .  

c.  Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposal risk will be individually assessed for the technical (oral presentation), cost and schedule areas. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. 

No other evaluation criteria will be used.  The oral and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time.  The Air Force reserves the right to select for award of a contract or assistance instrument any, all, part or none of the proposal received.  Award of a grant to universities or nonprofit institutions, or assistance instrument in lieu of a contract will be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties. The government also reserves the right to award any resulting contract pursuant to the Research and Development Standard Contract format in DFARS 235.70. 


SECTION E: OTHER INFORMATION TO OFFERORS:

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>MODIFIED 03/31/2003 - Go to:  http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/ctq/crp.asp for all future information regarding this procurement.  The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), on behalf of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL), has a requirement for a Communication Relay Payload (CRP) System that can be integrated into a Dragon Eye (DE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) System. The DE CRP is intended to provide a relay to a separate DE air vehicle that is extended beyond the normal line of sight (LOS) range. The basic requirements to fulfill this effort as described in the Statement of Work (SOW) are as follows. The contractor shall provide one (1) CRP System to be integrated into the DE UAV System that meets the following requirements. (a) The electronics for the CRP shall “fit” into the existing DE nose and weigh as close to one (1) pound as possible. (b) There shall be no Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) issues between the CRP system and all existing UAV electronics on board. All cables should be shielded. (c) The CRP shall interface with existing DE UAV communication links – uplink and downlink (e.g., power, frequencies). (d) The CRP shall operate in the following temperature range requirements:  -20 degrees Fahrenheit to +120 degrees Fahrenheit. (e) The electronics for the CRP shall draw power from the existing connector in the DE UAV nose. The connector provides 12 volts to the nose from the primary flight battery. (f) The electronics for the CRP shall be packaged in the DE UAV nose in a manner that will withstand a 20G shock load  (Requirement to protect the sensor as much as possible exists in order to reuse sensor if outer shell of nose is damaged). (g) The CRP shall operate in a light rain.  Conformal coating of circuit boards should be implemented as required.  The contractor shall describe additional options for implementation in light rain. (h) The electronics for the CRP shall be integrated without introducing changes to the bottom of the nose (due to dirt and debris intake).  If modifications to the nose are required, changes can be made to the sides or the top of the nose as long as they do not interfere with the aerodynamics of the air vehicle or the air data sensors. (i) The Center of Gravity (CG) of the aircraft shall be maintained upon integration of the electronics into the DE UAV nose. (j) The CRP system shall provide a minimum of four selectable non-interfering channels for both uplink and downlink. Downlink frequencies shall reside in 1710 – 1850 Megahertz (MHz) band, and uplink frequencies shall reside in 335.4 – 399.9 MHz band. The four specific frequencies shall be provided after contract award. Responses should be mailed to the following address: COMMANDER, Marine Corps Systems Command, Code CTQ6LF, 2033 Barnett Avenue Suite 315, Quantico, Virginia, 22134-5010. Email responses should be sent to frazierly@mcsc.usmc.mil.  The hand carry/courier address is: COMMANDER, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attention: Lynn Y. Frazier, Code CTQ6LF, 3041A McCawley Ave, Quantico, VA 22134. Responses shall be submitted not later than 14 Apr 2003. Note that the MCWL will retain all rights to any intellectual property developed under this contract. The technical POC for this requirement is Maj Matthew Culbertson, Marine Corps Warfighting Lab, (703) 784-3208/3209, and Mr. Brent Azzarelli at (703) 784-6413.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 Prospective Offeror Questions and Government Answers Q1.  We shall include the Bailment Agreement in our proposal; however, it is not clear whether you require us to sign it in advance of a date being provided for Article 3 of the Agreement.  Please advise. A1.  All other information must be filled in.  Signature will be done at time of award. Q2. We have a Cage Code #, TPIN Number, DUNS #, and is registered in the CCR; however, I am not familiar with the term “Contractor Establishment Code”?  Please advise. A2.  Contractor establishment Code is the DUNS#. Q3.  Section IV, Price of Evaluation Factors/Subfactors for Phase 1 Award and Phase II Down Select (Page 7 of 11) indicates “the offeror shall provide a quote to participate in Phase II testing.”  Is this requirement over and above CLIN 0001 Phase 1 SOW Testing and/or separate from CLIN 0002 pricing  for delivery of SDS Systems and Life Cycle Support? A3.  It is exactly as is stated, “the offeror shall provide a quote to participate in Phase II testing.”  The other pricing table is for SDS Systems; CLIN 0001 and 0002 will be the same pricing.  Life Cycle Support pricing is not required at this time, but will be required prior to selection for Phase II. Q4.  Regarding the proposal submission, it is our intention to e-mail the complete proposal including technical proposal on or before 3PM on 7 April 2003, as required.  Could you advise whether the required six (6) complete copies of the technical proposal must also be received by 3PM on 7 April 2003 or can they be received shortly thereafter assuming you receive an electronic copy by 3 PM on 7 April 2003. A4.  All hard copies must be received by 3 PM EST on 7 April 2003. Q5.  With regard to CLIN 0001 and CLIN 00 02, it is our understanding that CLIN 0001 will consist of Phase I SOW Testing Support and SDS Shipset Prices/Delivery (including a description of the SDS Shipset) and that CLIN 0001 SDS Shipset Prices/Delivery may be exercised as an amendment to the contract during Phase II as CLIN 0002.  Please confirm that we have correctly interpreted the requirements. A5.  This interpretation is correct.  The shipset prices will be for CLIN 0002, and this CLIN is an option on the Phase I contracts which may be exercised by the Government via written modification to the contract. Q6.  Paragraph 3.9.1 Test Support in the Statement of Work states, “It is anticipated that this testing and evaluation will be conducted in the third quarter of the Government’s FY03.”  Can you clarify for me what months this is referring to? A6.  The third quarter of the Government’s FY03 comprises April, M ay, and June of 2003. Q7.  Is it necessary that the sonar configuration demonstrated in Phase I meet 100% of the system requirements for deployment cable length and field of view as long as these parameters are brought up to specifications for CLIN 2? (Fig 3 in the SOW shows the reduced field of view requirement for the Phase I test. A7.  The cable length requirements (SOW Para 3.2 Item 1.10 and 1.11) were estimates of the cable runs necessary to (1) allow the sonar head to be deployed to the max bottom depth (SOW Para 3.2 Item 1.9) and (2) allow the operator displays associated with multiple sonar heads to be located in one location on a ship of the size shown in Fig 1 and 2 in the SOW.  (Same as the Phase I test ship dimensions shown in Fig 3 and 4).  Since the Phase I test site bottom depth is less than the max bottom depth requirement of SOW Para 3.2 Item 1.9, the SOW P ara 3.2 Item 1.10 minimum cable length requirement of 350' from the sonar head to the first dry interface box can be reduced to 200' for the Phase I test only. And the SOW Para 3.2 Item 1.11 minimum cable length requirement of 1300' from the sonar head to the operator display/control can be reduced to 1150' for the Phase I test only. The proposal will need to discuss what system modifications will be requires to meet the full requirements and the associated technical and schedule risks. Q8.  Clarify “response time.”  What is it in reference to? A8.  The classification range requirement (SOW Para 3.2 Item 1.3.1) was derived from the response time requirement (SOW Para 3.2 Item 1.2) based on typical target speeds, so if the contractor meets the classification range requirement it will meet the response time requirement as well. Therefore, offerors do not need to address the  response time requirement  (SOW Para 3.2 Item 1.2) separately, and instead should refer to their discussion of the classification range requirement (SOW Para 3.2 Item 1.3.1)) Q9.  Is this RFP for a small business set-aside? A9.  No.

<SUBJECT>66--Electric-Field sensor testing on fixed-wing aircraft.
<SOLNBR>03CR41-NO SOLICITATION
<RESPDATE>051503
<ARCHDATE>03302004
<CONTACT>BETTY L NELSON PURCHASING AGENT 3032369316     blnelson@usgs.gov;
<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 45 days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, GD, CICT, Denver, CO, has a requirement to test electric-field sensors in USGS aircraft.  The requirement is to adapt, install and flight test electric-field sensors in a USGS owned fixed-wing aircraft. The combined magnetic and electric-field measurements can possibly be used to measure the earth's subsurface electrical resistivity and thus its electrical conductivity.  Subsurface electrical conductivity is a fundamental physical property of the earth and is of great importance in geological and hydrological subsurface investigations.  The exact specifications for the 3-axis magnetic and electric field component sensor have been set by the Department of Defense, and the vendor needs the appropriate clearances from DOD to support the required supplies and service.     The Government has a definite requirement for testing these sensors on a fixed-wing aircraft with an option to adapt and install the sensors on a helicopter platform.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the supplies and services specified as a sole source from Quantum Applied Science and Research, 5764 Pacific Center Blvd, San Diego, CA, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.

<DESC>NA The Government requires a Satellite Service Provider for both L-band and/or Ku-band satellite service for data connections from multiple mobile platforms using small disadvantaged terminals for communications on the move, as a part of the Force Twenty-One,  Battle Command, Brigade and Below (FBCB2) and Blue Force Tracking(BFT).  L-band coverage will be needed in Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Northern Africa, and Southwest Asia, to include Afghanistan, beginning on 1 November 2003 and continuing for one yea r.  Additional areas that may require coverage are Continental USA, Hawaii, Alaska, Southeast Asia, Korea and Japan.  Ku-band coverage will be needed in Eastern Europe and SWA beginning on September 2003 and continuing for one year. A single provider does not have to be able to provide service to all areas. Regional providers are acceptable. If possible, operations through a US Government owned Earth Station is desired, but not required.  Capability to support short duration exercises world–wide, should be discussed.  Current capabilities and technical description of L-Band:  L-Band (1520 – 1570 MHz Fwd Link; 1620 – 1670 MHz Ret Link).  Each mobile terminal (Comtech Mobile Datacom models MT-2011E and MT-2010-04) transmits packetized messages of not more than 100 bytes i n length, with a variable output power (9dbW EIRP max), and using a Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum signal with either Right Hand Circular Polarization or Left Hand Circular Polarization. Transmission speed is variable from 2400 bps to a maximum of 9600 bp s. The number of platforms in any given area will vary from 30 to 3000, with each terminal transmitting at varying intervals of from 30 to 300 seconds. Receivers uses similar speeds and operate at signal levels greater than 27dbW from the satellite.  Satel lite network must be capable of handling multiple simultaneous transmissions from the mobile terminals with a message completion rate of greater than 95%, a total latency of less than 20 seconds for all messages within your portion of the circuit, and must  be capable of both point-to-point and broadcast connections, also known as uni-cast and multi-cast.  The connection at the Earth Station must be processed through proprietary processing equipment, which should be transparent to the service provider, and r e-sent via both an Internet VPN and VSAT circuit to our network operations centers. The equipment required for these circuits are provided by the US Government, and access to this equipment must be granted to technical personnel from Comtech Mobile Datacom .  Current providers are Thuraya (SWA), Inmarsat (Europe, N Africa, SWA), and Mobile Satellite Ventures (USA), with all contracts managed through Comtech Mobile Datacom. L-band coverage will be needed in Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Northern Africa, and  Southwest Asia, beginning on 1 November 2003 and continuing for one year.  Additional areas that may require coverage during this period are Continental USA, Hawaii, Alaska, Southeast Asia, Korea and Japan.  Current capabilities and technical description of Ku-Band:   Ku-Band (11680 – 12700 MHz Fwd Link; 14000 – 14500 MHz Ret Link). Each mobile terminal (QualComm OmniTracs ACU) transmits packetized messages of not more than 100 bytes in length, with a variable output power (15dbW EIRP max), and using a Direct Sequence S pread Spectrum signal with Right Hand Circular Polarization. Transmission speed is variable from 100 bps to a maximum of 600 bps. The number of platforms in any given area will vary from 50 to 1000, with each terminal transmitting at intervals of approxima tely 300 seconds. The receiver uses similar speeds and operates at signal levels greater than 39dbW from the satellite.  Satellite network must be capable of handling multiple simultaneous transmissions from the mobile terminals with a message completion r ate of greater than 90%, a total latency of less than 20 seconds for all messages within your portion of the circuit, and must be capable of both point-to-point and broadcast connections, also known as uni-cast and multi-cast. The current Earth Station is located in Central Germany, and is owned and operated by the US government. Current provider is Intelsat, with the contract man aged through QualComm.  Ku-band coverage will be needed in Eastern Europe and SWA beginning in September 2003 and continuing for one year.  The Government POC is Mr. Tom Denniston, 732-427-5978. This effort is anticipated to begin in September 2003, and be  required for a minimum of one year.  Any teaming arrangements with DISA should be identified.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) is conducting a market investigation to identify possible sources of a lightweight visual/infrared obscuration system for application on the Future Combat System (FCS).  The Operational Requirements Document for the Future Combat Systems (FCS), dated 25 Nov 02, indicates that the FCS must be capable of deploying multi-spectral obscurants and counter measures to defeat enemy acquisition systems and screen friendly actions.   Two systems will be purchas ed for a Government conducted test and evaluation program.  One system will be mounted on a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle by the Government and subjected to a road test over cross-country terrain.  In addition, a side-by-side obscuration test will be conducted against the U.S. Army M56 Smoke Generating System.  The other system will not be mounted on a HMMWV.  It will be subjected to hot/cold operational tests in a chamber and hot/cold laboratory vibration tests.  The vendor will supply technic al support during this integration and test phase.  A key requirement of the proposed visual/IR obscurant system is that it weighs less than 470 lbs.  It is anticipated that the integration effort will take four months and the test effort will take four mo nths.  The system selected must already be in production to allow for the above integration/test effort as detailed above.  This market survey is for information purposes only; this is not a Request for Quotations.  No solicitation document exists.  All in terested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  Responses may be sent via email to john.jagde@us.army.mil.

It is anticipated that the NT3C will produce high quality and highly efficient T&E support to its customers.  The formation of  NT3C Is an experiment that will last for five years with subsequent five-year option periods.  The NT3C will demonstrate the use of state of the art business-like practices in a T&E environment.      The Army’s strategic goals for this endeavor are to fully utilize the ATC industrial capacity; to increase industry access to the ATC’s unique testing capabilities; to simplify small business dealings with the Government; to enhance reinvestment into needed equipment and infrastructure, and; to evolve more business-like practices in the Government T&E sector.      Interested potential members may obtain the Draft Business Plan for NT3C, the NT3C Operating Agreement and the Selection Criteria from the ATC Website http://www.atc.army.mil/ATC_Pilot_Program/index.html.  Interested parties must submit a White Paper of not more than five pages describing:  the name and major competencies of their organization, how their organization would fit into the company and help achieve overarching goals and a summary of talents and skills employed by the organization, recognizi ng that the Selection Criteria will be applied to evaluation responses.  This White Paper is due to the Contracting Officer not later than 30 days after the date of this synopsis.      A panel will review the submitted White Papers and will rigorously apply the Selection Criteria to the White Papers in order to select an initial cadres of prospective Members.  Candidates identified as prospective members will then be requested to su bmit both a written proposal and oral presentation.  As part of their proposal, prospective members will be invited to make an oral presentation regarding their interest and capability to meet NT3C goals to the selection panel.   Details concerning the ora l presentation format and procedures are identified.  The remaining portion of the proposal will be submitted in writing, as identified in the selection criteria.   Again, the Selection Criteria will form the basis for evaluation of both the oral presentat ions and written proposals.  The Selection Authority may provide additional guidance regarding the oral presentations including further refinements of the Selection criteria, which will be provided to all selectees.      After the oral and written presentations, the panel will select the initial members of the NT3C.  The selectees will be notified in writing and provided with a copy of the Operating Agreement for their review.  The selected prospective Members must su bmit, within 15 days of notification, a signed Operating Agreement, a Draft Business Development Plan Concept Paper based on t he NT3C concept, a nomination of  an individual to serve on the Board of Members with sufficient authority to participate in the Board of Members’ deliberations and a cashier’s check of $150,000 payable to the ATC account to be designated in the notice let ter.      The prospective Member’s funds will be held in escrow until the formation of the company and all funds are deposited into the NT3C or, if for some reason the  NT3C is not formed, the check will be returned within 7 days of this event and there will be  no further claims by either party.      Once all Members have completed the above implementation details, the Commander of ATC or her designate, will establish a date for the initial organizational meeting of the NT3C Board of Members and shall publish the date of the Board of Members meeti ng in accordance with the Board of Members notification procedures of the Operating Agreement.

<DESC>The Investment Programs Office, 46th Test Wing (TSS), Eglin AFB, FL, plans to contract on a sole source basis, a three-year effort, to Sarnoff Corporation, 201 Washington Rd Princeton NJ to expand the capability of the Digital Video Laboratory (DVL) from the aircraft store certification process to the range's Test & Evaluation (T&E) process for full spectrum integration of digital video technology.  The DVL is currently in development by Sarnoff Corporation with a completion scheduled for September 2003.  As part of the new effort, the implementation of selected digital video and data management technologies into the Service's T&E processes will be accomplished.  Upon direction from the Government management team, the contractor will implement selected digital video technology and data management tools into the Services T&E process.  Selection will be based upon availability, cost, and anticipated benefits of information technologies and tools that may be used for the analysis of digital data.  Accomplishing the implementation of selected digital video technologies and completing a DoD roadmap is critical to minimizing costs associated with the transition now occurring from film and analog video to digital video at Eglin AFB and other Army and Navy facilities.  Developing and initiating an aggressive, holistic approach to this transition in the next 12- 36 months will significantly reduce the disruption costs associated with extended use of film and analog video as well as test processes and paradigms not optimized for full spectrum leverage of digital video technology.  This effort will begin approximately 1 October 2003.  We anticipate a one-year effort with options for two additional years. Accomplishing this task in minimum time with maximum effectiveness of output requires utilization of a contractor with the following qualifications:  1) Organic knowledge of the full spectrum of technologies associated with development and applications of digital video systems, including sensors, compression, transmission, processing, exploitation, metadata, multimedia fusion, storage, retrieval, and presentation.  This includes, but is not limited to:  a) Digital video imaging sensors and systems, b) Conversion of film to a digital format with no significant loss in fidelity, c) Digital video compression in multiple formats, frame rates, and with techniques that utilize full resolution of all components at dynamic ranges equal to, or exceeding, that of MPEG-2, d) Perceptual quality measurement techniques for video quality metering, e) Digital video stabilization algorithms, which can be implemented in both real-time and non real-time scenarios, f) Digital video archive and retrieval systems, g) Digital studio procedures, which allow users to access data in a variety of formats from a variety of sources, h) Video compositing and mosaicing methods that provide extended resolution and expanded context beyond a traditional field of view, i) Moving target indication algorithms to locate and track the paths of several objects within a field of view, j) Compressed domain-processing techniques, which allow for some analysis of video without the need to decompress, k) Visualization techniques, which provide novel and innovative ways to display a range of data within video, l) Metadata technology, which allows for the storage of data within compressed digital video bitstreams.  2) Firm connections and understanding of the commercial digital video market including commercial research and development laboratories.  3) Experience with process oriented integration of digital video into military and other government agency applications.
To date, only the Sarnoff Corporation meets these criteria and can accomplish the desired task within the specified time constraints.  Sarnoff has demonstrated these capabilities through the Phase 1 and Phase 2 efforts and other government contracts.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it does not constitute an IFB or RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  Prospective contractors must submit evidence substantiating they possess the detailed knowledge and capabilities indicated previously.  The anticipated contract type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  This document must be submitted no later than COB 15 May 2003.  The NAICs code for this effort is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Please ensure that the format for the document is compatible with MS Office 97.  If other software applications are used, please contact the Contracting Officer to ensure compatibility.  In responding, reference RFP F08635-03-R-0082.  Forward qualification packages to AAC/PKZA, Attn: Jewel Burgess, 205 West D Avenue, Suite 467, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6864.

The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager identified above.

<SUBJECT>R--Workshop Manager - Scientist
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to use University scientists and the facilities at Colorado State University for a workshop to be held April 16, 2003 through April 17, 2003.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency requirement is Colorado State University, Office of Conference Service, Ft. Collins, CO  80523.  A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. The following statement of work applies to this requirement:  1. General Requirement:  Manager-Scientist Workshop to be held in Tucson, Arizona,  (a)  Meeting Space.  (1)  Plenary Session.  The workshop planners envision a "plenary" session in which 85 to 125 scientists and managers will meet to discuss the 2002 wildland fire season, including the Rodeo-Chediski fire.  The plenary session shall have conference capability including seating arrangements and facilities to include sound system, large screen projection capability, and adequate tables and chairs for the estimated number of participants.  (2)  Breakout Sessions.  The participants will be broken into six sub groups based on functional areas of pre-fire, fire, and post-fire management (such as air quality and smoke management, and fire and fuels management).  The purpose of the breakout sessions is to identify and prioritize research needs in each of six functional areas.  Each breakout session will require seating and work facilities for six to 20 participants.  (b)  Organization and Management of Workshop.  The Contractor shall manage all workshop logistics including workshop registration, information packet design and contents, development and issuance letters of invitation, media relations, identification and hosting of the breakout groups, and note-taking of proceedings of the breakout sessions.  (c)  Equipment.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all sound equipment (see item 1), flip charts and name tags.  (d)  Pre-Work and Related Materials, and Expertise of University Scientists.  (1)  The Contractor shall provide adequate professional papers and related materials to ensure each participant will be current and well informed regarding the wildland fire issues germane to the geographic area.  The expertise of university scientists shall be provided to ensure independent and professional approach to problem solving.  The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $50,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  This requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 541990 applies. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item #RAQ032306.  However, they must provide supporting evidence they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by April 14, 2003 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Colorado State University for the requirements stated here.  Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Kay Ryan at 208-387-5717 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

The NT3C Operating Agreement shall contain provisions for selection of additional members and termination procedures for departing members.       The company to be formed, NT3C, will be a “for profit” Limited Liability Company.  The objective is to identify, document, and develop enhanced methods in Test and Evaluation (T&E) product production to result from the blending of the physical and int ellectual properties of its military, academia, and private business members.  It is anticipated that the NT3C will produce high quality and highly efficient T&E support to its customers.  The formation of  NT3C Is an experiment that will last for five years with subsequent five-year option periods.  The NT3C will demonstrate the use of state of the art business-like practices in a T&E environment.      The Army’s strategic goals for this endeavor are to fully utilize the ATC industrial capacity; to increase industry access to the ATC’s unique testing capabilities; to simplify small business dealings with the Government; to enhance reinvestment into needed equipment and infrastructure, and; to evolve more business-like practices in the Government T&E sector.      Interested potential members may obtain the Draft Business Plan for NT3C, the NT3C Operating Agreement and the Selection Criteria from the ATC Website http://www.atc.army.mil/ATC_Pilot_Program/index.html.  Interested parties must submit a White Paper of not more than five pages describing:  the name and major competencies of their organization, how their organization would fit into the company and help achieve overarching goals and a summary of talents and skills employed by the organization, recognizi ng that the Selection Criteria will be applied to evaluation responses.  This White Paper is due to the Contracting Officer not later than 30 days after the date of this synopsis.      A panel will review the submitted White Papers and will rigorously apply the Selection Criteria to the White Papers in order to select an initial cadres of prospective Members.  Candidates identified as prospective members will then be requested to su bmit both a written proposal and oral presentation.  As part of their proposal, prospective members will be invited to make an oral presentation regarding their interest and capability to meet NT3C goals to the selection panel.   Details concerning the ora l presentation format and procedures are identified.  The remaining portion of the proposal will be submitted in writing, as identified in the selection criteria.   Again, the Selection Criteria will form the basis for evaluation of both the oral presentat ions and written proposals.  The Selection Authority may provide additional guidance regarding the oral presentations including further refinements of the Selection criteria, which will be provided to all selectees.      After the oral and written presentations, the panel will select the initial members of the NT3C.  The selectees will be notified in writing and provided with a copy of the Operating Agreement for their review.  The selected prospective Members must su bmit, within 15 days of notification, a signed Operating Agreement, a Draft Business Development Plan Concept Paper based on t he NT3C concept, a nomination of  an individual to serve on the Board of Members with sufficient authority to participate in the Board of Members’ deliberations and a cashier’s check of $150,000 payable to the ATC account to be designated in the notice let ter.      The prospective Member’s funds will be held in escrow until the formation of the company and all funds are deposited into the NT3C or, if for some reason the  NT3C is not formed, the check will be returned within 7 days of this event and there will be  no further claims by either party.

<SUBJECT>--PyroPac Heating Fuel Gel
<DESC>NA Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis to PyroPac, 20776 FM 2252, San Antonio, TX 78266, which is for the procurement of PyroPac beverage heating fuel gel for immediate use by deploying and/or deployed US troops to the CENTCOM area of operation, which gives the warfighter the ability to obtain hot beverages in a field environment in the time allotted for a res t break. The PyroPac gel is the only fuel which meets the following user requirements: it is tactical in that it burns with a steady blue flame which does not disclose the warfighters position; has negligible vapor pressure that allows it to be declared a non-flammable substance and therefore not subject to Department of Transportation hazardous material regulation, which allows for ease of transport to overseas destinations; and has a completed safety and health data sheet, required for an immediate materi al fielding. Additionally, the heat to mass ratio allows the warfighter to carry lesser amounts of fuel than others to complete their mission. Questions concerning this acquisition may be addressed to the above address, Attention: Mr. Thomas Bouchard (AMSS B-ACC-NS) or by E-mail.  See Note 22, which is decreased from 45 days to 5 days.
