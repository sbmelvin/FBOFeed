The MP-1001 Phase Maintenance Platform is comprised of five modules, two side decks, one center deck, and two stair cases. The modules are designed for use as a structure while allowiong for increased mobility and ease of storage. When assembled the height is adjustable 12 inches to accommodate varying aircraft height and user preference. No solicitation documents exists at this time.

<RESPDATE>080108
<CONTACT>Charles D. Kotch, Phone 202-366-6622, Email charles.kotch@dot.gov - Robert A Robel, Contracting Officer/Team Leader, Phone (202) 366-4227, Fax (202) 366-3705, Email robert.robel@dot.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this solicitation is to provide an opportunity for one or more organizations to participate in the Development and Deployment phase of the Clarus Multi-state Regional Demonstrations. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), both agencies of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), request proposals to result in the award of one or more contracts to private sector and/or academic institutions for the development and implementation of new, innovative Business-to-Government (B2G) services, and to some extent, Business-to-Traveler (B2T) services.

The Clarus Initiative, established in 2004, is a multi-year program administered and funded by the USDOT. The Initiative includes program management, stakeholder coordination, education and outreach activities, and the actual engineering and implementation of the Clarus System. Through the Clarus System, the FHWA is demonstrating a data management system for sharing quality checked surface transportation weather and pavement observations. Through the sharing of high quality, surface transportation-related observations from the Clarus System, it is envisioned that this enabling technology will aid in reducing the impact of adverse weather for all surface transportation users and operators. 

Under a separate FHWA award, Contract No. DTFH61-05-C-00022, the Clarus System was designed based upon an overall Concept of Operations (ConOps) and requirements defined by Clarus stakeholders. Clarus System development was completed and implemented during a proof-of-concept deployment in 2006 to ensure that the system components operated and interfaced properly. The Clarus System ConOps, requirements, system design documents and test plan can be found on the Clarus Initiative website which is located at http://www.clarusinitiative.org/Archive.htm.


Progress on the Clarus Initiative has advanced such that the Government began conducting Multi-state Regional Demonstrations during 2006. Through the Clarus Multi-state Regional Demonstrations the Government aims to achieve the following objectives: 

(1) 	Demonstrate that the Clarus System functions as designed by incentivizing a large number of State (or Provincial) and local agencies to contribute data from their ESS networks; 
(2) 	Enable proactive transportation system management through utilization of the Clarus System; and, 
(3) 	Provide an environment for the private sector and academic organizations to innovate and create new and improved services that will benefit the public (both government and travelers), academia and the entire weather enterprise.

The first phase of the Clarus Multi-state Regional Demonstrations was launched during the fall of 2006 with a Request for Applications (RFA) to State DOTs (DTFH61-07-RA-00001). This RFA satisfied the first two objectives listed above by incentivizing transportation agencies to contribute their ESS data and metadata to the Clarus System and to document their needs (for new products, techniques, etc.) within a new set of services. These services are documented within three sets of ConOps and are central to the successful response to this solicitation. 

The second phase of the Clarus Multi-state Regional Demonstrations began during the summer of 2007. This phase, the Connection Incentive Program, provides grants to public transportation agencies to assist them in connecting to the Clarus System. Funding from the grants could be used, with FHWA approval, for expenses associated with metadata collection or for software or hardware changes needed to connect to the system. Agencies will be able to participate in this phase (and apply for grants) until the end of September 2008.

This Request for Proposals (RFP) is specifically focused on the third phase of the Clarus Multi-state Regional Demonstrations; development and deployment of Clarus-enabled services which build upon use case scenarios provided within the Phase 1 ConOps. In addition to the development and implementation activities, the contractor(s) will be expected to document their experiences in using the Clarus System.

The objective of this contract to fulfill Phase 3 of the Clarus Multi-state Regional Demonstrations and show how data from the Clarus System are utilized by, or a benefit to, the public and the public agencies responsible for transportation system operations.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to procure the following Commercial items from TA Instruments -Waters LLC:1) Qty.1 - Q2000 Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimeter with Autosampler and MassFlow Control.  These are the specs: the most important specifications for the procurementof the DSC are the autosampling feature, the temperature range, temperature accuracy &precision, calorimetric accuracy & precision, use of the existingpans/controller/accessories, and compatibility with the existing thermal data.	The newDSC must have the capability for autosampling.	The operating temperature range for thenew DSC is an important specification; the DSC is required to have an operating range of-180C to 725C.  The accuracy and precision of the temperature for the new instrument isa critical specification, and as such the DSC needs the highest accuracy & precisionavailable: accuracy of +/-0.1C & precision of +/-0.01C.  Equally important is thecalorimetric accuracy and precision, and the requirements for the DSC are for an accuracyand precision of +/-0.05%.  Finally, the current DSC is a TA Instruments DSC2910 and willcontinue to be used after the purchase of the new DSC.	It is vital that the existing DSCand its data be compatible with the new system.  This compatibility will ensure that datafrom the new instrument is comparable to the historical data, and it will also allow thelab to continue to use existing DSC pans. 2) Qty. 1 - Tzero Press and Die Sets Kit: The kit consists of the Tzero Press, four (4)die sets, and one box each of Tzero Pans and Tzero Lids.(100/box).  3) Qty. 1 - Liquid Nitrogen Cooling System (LNCS) 4) Qty. 1 - Pressure Regulator for pressure regulation of gases used with Q Seriesthermal modules (4,000 psi input; 40 psi output CGA)5) Qty. 1 - RCS Gas Dryer: molecular sieve cartridge dryer for removal of trace moisture in purge gases. 6) Qty. 1 - Q800 Dynamic Mechanical Analyser. These are the specs:The most important specifications for the DMA are the drive shaft system, thedisplacement measurement, amplitude range & resolution, the ability to test creep &stress relaxation, use of the existing clamps/controller/accessories, and compatibilitywith the existing thermal data.  The drive shaft system is the critical part of the DMA;an air bearing system is required, as it will have very low friction, enabling accuratemeasurement of low modulus material with minimal error.  In terms of the displacementmeasurement, an optical encoder is required rather than a LVDT, as it will be accurateover a large range (0-25mm) and will enable the measurement of large deformationmaterials.  The DMA needs to handle large deformation with consistent high resolution; anamplitude resolution of 1nm is best.  The DMA must be able to perform creep and stressrelaxation measurements.  Finally, the current DMA is a TA Instruments DMA2980 and willcontinue to be used after the purchase of the new DMA.	Compatibility with the existingDMA and its data format is very important, as the new DMA should be able to use theexisting sample holders and other accessories. Options to include: Q800 Low Friction 20mm Three Point Bend Kit and Q800 Film & Fiber Tension Kit: Kit includes one set of smoothclamp fixtures for testing films and fibers in a tensile mode on the DMA 2980.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Themis Computer, 47200 Bayside Parkway, Fremont, CA for the acquisition of four (4) XEL Servers and three (3) RES-32DCO Rugged Enterprise Servers.  The servers will be used on the Navigation, Command and Control System (AN/SSN-2(V)5).  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Themis Computer is the sole manufacturer of these servers.  Currently, drawings or specifications are not available.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 system has already gone through and passed environmental and shock testing with this part installed.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without further testing and approval from the Program Office.  NSWC PCD has been assigned as the In-Service Engineering Activity and tasked to procure interim support parts, making time an issue.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly in time and dollars to the government and to the mission.  Use of another system may change or introduce new parameters that may be harmful to the AN/SSN-2(V)5 system.  Therefore it is imperative that the servers are acquired from Themis Computers.  FSC Code is 7021, NAICS Code is 334111, SBA Size Standard is 1,000 employees.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, Regional Services Center (RSC), Budapest, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its client Mission, USAID Serbia and Montenegro, in anticipation of a cost-reimbursement completion contract to implement a five year project entitled the Separation of Powers Program (SPP) to be implemented in Serbia.
Shortcomings in the rule of law, separation of powers among the three branches of government, and judicial independence have been identified as fundamental obstacles to Serbia's accession to the European Union (EU) and as reform priorities by the Serbian government. The SPP is designed to help Serbia move closer to EU accession by addressing these issues and strengthening the division of power and authority more equably among Serbia's three branches of government. Part of SPP's work with the courts will develop the judiciary's capacity to plan for, allocate, acquire and manage the judiciary's resources, through the establishment of a budget and finance office. SPP's other work with the courts will assist the judicial branch in making its administration of justice more efficient, transparent and responsive to the needs of its users by helping to establish a career track and training program for court administrators, helping the judiciary learn to manage courts effectively and openly, and reducing backlogs and improving case processing times in selected courts. Work with Serbia's National Assembly will focus primarily on assisting parliamentary staff and leaders to plan for, acquire, allocate and manage its own institutional resources in both the short and long term.  

This is a full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply. 
Interested firms can register and use the Interested Vendor List (IVL) on the FedBizOpps page: http://www2.fbo.gov/EPSVendorsManual/VG6-Interest.html, so that firms can contact one another for consideration of teaming arrangements and/or small business subcontracting opportunities in response to this solicitation. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990. The small business size standard is $6.5 million.

In accordance with FAR 5.102(d) availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. The solicitation will be posted herewith at FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) on or about or not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued.  

Please do not contact USAID/Serbia and Montenegro. All communication must be through this office. Questions must be directed to Mr. Hani Takla and Mr. Andrew Holland, U.S. Agency for International Development, email: htakla@usaid.gov, and aholland@usaid.gov.

We anticipate to make one direct award for the implementation of this project. The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

During construction, the contractor shall ensure that the existing chilled water plant, which feeds an adjacent building, operates 24/7 without interruption.

Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, renovation and conversion of the building in accordance with the specifications, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, maintaining of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, commissioning and turnover to designated facility management staff, and other required supplemental services as requested by GSA.  During contract performance, the CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, means to achieve the best value in performance, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for renovation and conversion of the facility.

The Price Proposals will be due two weeks after the receipt of technical proposals 7/7/2008.  In accordance with GSA policy, the RFP will be issued electronically via FEDBIZOPPS (www.fbo.gov).  This site provides instructions for downloading the RFP and for obtaining the associated design documents.

Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.

Phone inquiries may not be returned.  All correspondence shall be in writing and submitted to the email address pr ovided.  THIS ACQUISITION IS SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS VENDORS ONLY.  This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only.  A small business set-aside solicitation shall be issued with competition limited to eligible small business firms for Tactical Infrastructure (TI) Supplies (ie: concrete, steel, railroad rail, rip rap, lumber, nails, guardrails, fencing material, miscellaneous small tools, and other miscellaneous construction building and maintenance materials).  The supply requ irements are to support the development of new TI construction and or the operations and maintenance (repair and alteration) to tactical infrastructure for the Department of Homeland Security/Customs and Border Protection/Border Patrol (DHS/CBP/BP).  Contr actors will be required to provide resources to accommodate rapid response, in remote locations, for the supply requirements.  Contractors will be required to deliver supplies under a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis within the full scope of work needed to sup port the infrastructure supply need.   The primary location for these MATOCs shall be for projects in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the Tucson Arizona Sector.   These MATOCs may also be used for projects located in the CBP Yuma, San Diego, El Centro, El Paso, Marfa, Del Rio, Laredo, and Rio Grande Valley Sectors, if required to support DHS/CBP program requirements.  Typical supplies include, but are not limited to, items such as concrete, steel, railroad rail and other equipment, rip rap, Storm Water Pollution Prevention (SWPP) materials, sign materials, survey materials, lumber, nails, guardrails, fencing material, light poles and accessories, lighting assemblies (fixtures), power distribution equipment (high and low voltage electrica l distribution supplies), electrical wiring, conduit, paving materials, lumber, fasteners, paint and associated material, concrete, asphalt, steel materials, concrete pipe, (caulking, etc.), gabion materials, culverts, wire mesh and other miscellaneous con struction building materials, pre-cast vehicle and pedestrian barriers, gates, temporary fencing, etc.  Some incidental tools related to the installation of supplies will be included (ie; welding tools, etc.)   It is the intent of the Fort Worth District to issue one (1) solicitation with a Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA) for award of up to four (4) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for the Tucson Sectors TI supply support.  These four MATOC Contracts  are considered a pool for the Tucson Sector.  Each task order shall be competed amongst the contractors in the pool.  The estimated duration for each contract will be an initial base period term of twelve (12) months, with up to four (4) option period ter ms of twelve (12) months each, for a maximum contract term not to exceed sixty (60) months/five (5) years.   Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory/concerns; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total c ontract capacity limit is reached, or 5) unless the contract is terminated for convenience of the Government.  Each contractor in the Tucson MATOC pool has the competitive opportunity to receive task order awards up to the shared MATOC pool estimated contr act capacity of $100 Million.   Typically the pool of up to four (4) Tucson MATOCs described above will be for performance by the MATOC pool closest to where the project requirement exists (e.g., Tucson, AZ project requirement will be first considered for performance by the Tucson, AZ  M ATOC pool of vendors, before consideration is provided for performance by another MATOC pool).   However, magnitude of the project, the existing work load of the MATOC pool and past performance will also be considered.  If a contractor fails to perform, be comes incapable of performance, or performs so poorly that the Contracting Officer makes the determination that the risk is too high to proceed with the preferred Sector MATOC vendors, then the task order may be awarded to another MATOC in the pool.  It is  likely that several MATOCs will be performing several task orders at the same time.  If the set-aside MATOC awards cannot be achieved for a particular Border Patrol Sector, the first option would be to award a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) IDIQ  to a set-aside contractor for the maximum capacity the vendor is qualified to execute.  The remaining capacity for that Border Patrol Sector will then be equally distributed among the other successful set-aside MATOC pools.  This process will be included in the public notice as well as the solicitation to advise the set-aside contractors of the possibility that the contract capacity may increase if a set-aside MATOC for a particular Border Patrol Sector cannot be achieved.  The MATOCs shall include contrac t terms and conditions to accommodate the potential need to include the task order scope of work under Indefinite Delivery Contracts (ref:  FAR 16.500 and DFARS 216.501).   The minimum guarantee for each MATOC contract will be $10,000.00.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated by the issuance of task orders.  The minimum task order limitat ion will be $3,000.00.   The estimated maximum task order limitation is $2 million.  With the agreement of both parties task orders may be awarded over the stated maximum task order threshold.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government with price and technical evaluation factors.  Procurement consideration will be given to technical capability (including experienc e, past performance, delivery, and price).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 423390 (Other Construction Materials Merchant Wholesalers), which corresponds to SIC 5039.  The size standard for NAI CS code 423390 is 500 employees.  This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.  Notification of amendments shall be made via FebBizOpps only.  It is, therefore, the contractors responsibility to check the below- listed Internet address daily for any posted changes to this solicitation.   A separate synopsis and solicitation for the other small business and socio-economic groups, i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) is also being issued in the near future.  The 8(a); HUBZone, and SDVOSB will all b e competitive set-asides.   Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about November 21, 2007.  Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about December 28, 2007.  Contractors are encouraged to utilize the functions in FedBizOpps.

Phone inquiries may not be returned.  All correspondence shall be in writing and submitted to the email address pr ovided.   THIS ACQUISITION IS SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS VENDORS ONLY.  This synopsis is for the purpose of a pre-solicitation notification only.  A small business set-aside solicitation shall be issued with competition limited to eligible small business firms for  Tactical Infrastructure (TI) Supplies (ie: concrete, steel, railroad rail, rip rap, lumber, nails, guardrails, fencing material, miscellaneous small tools, and other miscellaneous construction building and maintenance materials).  The supply requirements are to support the development of new TI construction and or the operations and maintenance (repair and alteration) to tactical infrastructure for the Department of Homeland Security/Customs and Border Protection/Border Patrol (DHS/CBP/BP).  Contractors wi ll be required to provide resources to accommodate rapid response, in remote locations, for the supply requirements.  Contractors will be required to deliver supplies under a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis within the full scope of work needed to support the infrastructure supply need.   The primary location for these MATOCs shall be for projects in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the San Diego and El Centro California Sector areas.  These MATOCs may also be used for projects loca ted in the CBP Tucson, Yuma, El Paso, Marfa, Del Rio, Laredo, and Rio Grande Valley Sectors, if required to support DHS/CBP program requirements.  Typical supplies include, but are not limited to, items such as concrete, steel, railroad rail and other equi pment, rip rap, Storm Water Pollution Prevention (SWPP) materials, sign materials, survey materials, lumber, nails, guardrails, fencing material, light poles and accessories, lighting assemblies (fixtures), power distribution equipment (high and low voltag e electrical distribution supplies), electrical wiring, conduit, paving materials, lumber, fasteners, paint and associated material, concrete, asphalt, steel materials, concrete pipe, (caulking, etc.), gabion materials, culverts, wire mesh and other miscel laneous construction building materials, pre-cast vehicle and pedestrian barriers, gates, temporary fencing, etc.  Some incidental tools related to the installation of supplies will be included (ie; welding tools, etc.)   It is the intent of the Fort Worth District to issue one (1) solicitation with a Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA) for award of up to four (4) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for the San Diego and El Centro California Sectors TI supply support.   These four MATOC Contracts are considered a pool for the San Diego and El Centro Sectors.  Each task order shall be competed amongst the contractors in the pool.  The estimated duration for each contract will be an initial base period term of twelve (12)  months, with up to four (4) option period terms of twelve (12) months each, for a maximum contract term not to exceed sixty (60) months/five (5) years.   Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a docume nted past performance record of unsatisfactory/concerns; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) unless the contract is terminated for convenience of the Government.  Each c ontractor in the San Diego and El Centro MATOC pool has the competitive opportunity to receive task order awards up to the shared MATOC pool estimated contract capacity of $14 Million.   Typically the pool of up to four (4) MATOCs, for the San Diego and El Centro Sectors,  described above will be for performance by the MATOC pool closest to where the project requirement exists (e.g., San Diego and El Centro project requirement will be firs t considered for performance by the San Diego and El Centro MATOC pool of vendors, before consideration is provided for performance by another MATOC pool).  However, magnitude of the project, the existing work load of the MATOC pool and past performance wi ll also be considered.  If a contractor fails to perform, becomes incapable of performance, or performs so poorly that the Contracting Officer makes the determination that the risk is too high to proceed with the preferred Sector MATOC vendors, then the ta sk order may be awarded to another MATOC in the pool.  It is likely that several MATOCs will be performing several task orders at the same time.  If the set-aside MATOC awards cannot be achieved for a particular Border Patrol Sector, the first option would  be to award a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) IDIQ to a set-aside contractor for the maximum capacity the vendor is qualified to execute.  The remaining capacity for that Border Patrol Sector will then be equally distributed among the other succe ssful set-aside MATOC pools.  This process will be included in the public notice as well as the solicitation to advise the set-aside contractors of the possibility that the contract capacity may increase if a set-aside MATOC for a particular Border Patrol Sector cannot be achieved.  The MATOCs shall include contract terms and conditions to accommodate the potential need to include the task order scope of work under Indefinite Delivery Contracts (ref:  FAR 16.500 and DFARS 216.501).   The minimum guarantee for each MATOC contract will be $10,000.00.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated by the issuance of task orders.  The minimum task order limitat ion will be $3,000.00.   The estimated maximum task order limitation is $2 million.  With the agreement of both parties task orders may be awarded over the stated maximum task order threshold.  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition; there will be no public bid opening.  All contracts will be awarded based upon an evaluation of the overall Best Value to the Government with price and technical evaluation factors.  Procurement consideration will be given to technical capability (including experienc e, past performance, delivery, and price).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 423390 (Other Construction Materials Merchant Wholesalers), which corresponds to SIC 5039.  The size standard for NAI CS code 423390 is 500 employees.  This solicitation will be issued via Internet only on FebBizOpps Website at www.fbo.gov.  Notification of amendments shall be made via FebBizOpps only.  It is, therefore, the contractors responsibility to check the below- listed Internet address daily for any posted changes to this solicitation.   A separate synopsis and solicitation for the other small business and socio-economic groups, i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) is also being issued in the near future.  The 8(a); HUBZone, and SDVOSB will all b e competitive set-asides.   Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about November 21, 2007.  Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about December 28, 2007.   Contractors are encouraged to utilize the functions in FedBizOpps.  Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), in order to receive a Government contract award.  To register, the CCR Internet address is: http://www.ccr.gov .

<DESC>Active/Passive Metal Detector

Introduction: DTRA is soliciting white papers to integrate selectable passive and non-passive metal detection technology into a single unit or instrument that is currently made or one that can be easily constructed. The instrument should be light weight (less than 2.5 lbs), one-man portable (able to condense down and store in a 5.56 magazine type pocket on equipment) and able to detect very small amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous materials. The sensitivity of the instrument should be enough to allow it to detect individual objects such as solid state electronic components and assembled circuit boards from single or multiple sources such as packages, bags, walls, floors, and different soil types with a minimum of 2-3 inch standoff. Detection and response should be quick and precise allowing the operator to scan the object quickly. 

Background: DTRAs mission is to safeguard America and its allies from weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high explosives CBRNE) by reducing the present threat and preparing for the future threat.  

Services: The proposal should include discussions using only proven active and passive detector technologies such as Electro-Magnetic Induction (EMI); Magnetometers; Gradiometers; and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). Unproven, experimental, or theoretical search technologies will not be considered. The discussion should include only the technologies that would be required to search, detect and locate ferrous and non-ferrous metallic materials.   

The instrument should be a design that is capable of penetrating soft materials (i.e.  hay stacks, between flour/rice bags) smoothly, rugged enough to use as a probe through loosely packed soils or materials, and capable of sweeping uneven or grown over terrain.  Instrumentation and user interface controls should be located in the same location as the handle or grip. The instrument may be used while standing fully upright, kneeling, low crawling or in a physical security mode to search for metal objects.  The instrument should be capable of varying lengths from 48 inches (fully extended) to 8 inches (collapsed).   The instrument must be capable of full operation while fully extended or collapsed or at any point in between.  The total dimensions collapsed cannot exceed 8 inches long x 3 inches wide x 2 inches deep.  The handle should conform to the instrument and should not extend or protrude off of the instrument when collapsed.  The instrument should be ruggedized, capable of operating in all weather and all terrains.
The controls should be simple on/off selectable, thumb wheel type or push button, easily used with one hand and configured to respond to only positive intended commands. The instrument should have a selectable on/off intensity switch for controlling a visual indicator as well as controlling the sensitivity settings for the passive and active detectors. The visual indicator should consist of intensity indicator lights and should be Infra-red selectable.  A selectable on/off audible indicator should be included and an output must be available for a user headset. Controls should also allow the operator to select between active and passive search modes or a combination of the two modes. 
The instrument should be capable of one-handed operation. Overall weight should be 1.5 - 2.5 lbs; counterbalanced or with wrist or forearm support to facilitate use when fully extended. The design must use a commercial off the shelf power supply such as a 3 volt lithium battery. The power supply must be integrated into the instrument.  The instrument should be capable of continuous operation for 4 hours between 30-90 degrees F. 
Overall use is for the instrument to function much like a standard metal detector but incorporating technologies in order to detect all metals, not necessarily associated with ordnance or landmines and to provide a smaller, lighter, more flexible instrument that will be capable in a diverse range of operating environments.  The total time of the effort must be completed in 18 months or less.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA)Universal Electromagnetic Launcher
This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).     Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Interested parties are invited to respond to this synopsis.  No hard copy version of this announcement will be made available. The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  One or more technology areas may receive no funding.  Also, the Government reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  In that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government will not pay for proposal preparation costs.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this BAA is not allowable as a direct charge to any contract resulting from this BAA or to any other Government contract.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.
Funds may not be available for all requirements under this BAA.  No contract awards will be made until appropriated funds are available from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  The Government may incrementally fund contracts awarded from this BAA as provided by FAR 52.232-22, Limitation of Funds. Most contracts awarded are anticipated to be 24 to 36 months in duration. To facilitate incremental funding, submissions shall include the cost and schedule by a task-phased structure organized by fiscal year (October through September) with clear exit criteria, and shall be inclusive of all work to complete the effort including any options. It is anticipated that the entire effort will be negotiated with the initial contract award.
This BAA will remain open for approximately ninety days from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA, which may occur at any time.  Proposals may be submitted at any time during this period.  
The Government encourages nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI) (HBCU/MIs), women-owned businesses, and Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) zone enterprises as well as large businesses and Government agencies to submit proposals for consideration and/or to join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of the BAA will be set-aside for these special entities because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research and development in any specific requirement area.  The final determination will be made based on the relevance of the proposal to requirement, individual technical merits of the proposal and budget constraints within the mission priorities.
A three-step proposal selection process will be used for this solicitation to minimize cost and effort of prospective offerors.Step One- will consist of an Industry Day on 22 May 2008 where the technology and applications to be developed will be presented and to allow prospective offerors an opportunity to ask general questions.  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the Government.Since no Contracting Officer will be present during this Industry Day, nothing discussed is contractually binding to the government in any way.  Location:	Auditorium Conference Room 1083		Northrop Grumman Corp.		300 M. St. SE, Suite 100		Washington, DC 20003Date:		22 May 2008Time:  		10:00 a.m. Eastern Time
IN ORDER TO ENSURE ADQUATE SPACE IS AVAILABLE, PROSPECTIVE ATTENDEES MUST NOTIFY DR. FRANK MANSFIELD VIA EMAIL AT FRANCIS.MANSFIELD@NAVY.MIL  OF THEIR INTENT TO ATTEND THE INDUSTRY DAY.   IN THE EVENT THERE IS NOT ADQUATE SPACE FOR ALL INTERESTED PARTIES, AN ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY DAY MAY BE SCHEDULED.  Step Two- will be used to solicit, receive, and evaluate a Quad chart and a brief White Paper (see proposal preparation guidelines below) that discusses the development of the technology to address the desired outcomes.  Step Three- If the Step Two proposal is accepted for further detailed review, this step will consist of detailed presentations and submissions.  Submitters will be contacted with specific formatting and presentation instructions if selected to proceed through step three for funding consideration.  Subsequent to funding approval, full technical proposals will be requested.
DEFINITIONSHEEL  Highly Efficient Electromagnetic LauncherLIM  Linear Induction MotorTLIM  Tubular Linear Induction MotorIGBT  Insulated Gate Bipolar TransistorsVLS  Vertical Launch System
DESCRIPTION OF OPPORTUNITY.  The Department of Defense (DOD) solicits proposals for the application of HEEL technology to the areas of low speed cold missile launch and high speed projectile launch. The efforts will lead to the demonstration of a full-scale full-mass SM-3 model launch and a low mass projectile launch greater than three kilometers per second (km/s). The demonstrators must include as a minimum the launcher tube, launcher mount, energy storage, solid-state inverters, data acquisition, and software for motor control. The demonstrator must be completed within 24 to 48 months from award and address one or both of the following solicitation areas:
(1)  SM-3 Electromagnetic Missile Launcher demonstrator to include a preliminary VLS design that is compatible with CG(X) form and fit.(2)  High speed HEEL demonstrator capable of accelerating a low mass projectile to 3 kilometers per second (km/s) or better.
ELECTROMAGNETIC MISSILE LAUNCHER DEMONSTRATOR REQUIREMENTS.
(1)  A HEEL based Electromagnetic Missile Launcher (EMML) is a true AC TLIM technology that has the ability to vault a missile up to a safe altitude before the thrust is imitated from the missile propulsion system. A EMML system is envisioned to be comprised of nine major components: 1) a composite TLIM canister holding the stator coils of the linear motor; 2) a bucket that holds the missile to be vaulted and represents the armature of the linear motor; 3) Solid-state inverters to drive the stators; 4) energy storage; 5) armature position and velocity measuring capability; 6) motor control software and hardware; 7) the projectile, which in this case is a sub-scale low mass projectile, a sub-scale full mass projectile, and a full size full mass SM-3 replica; 8) launcher tube mounting structure; and 9) data acquisition and reduction system.  
(2)  EMML Requirements.  Proposals are envisioned to be a three-phase demonstration approach: 1) medium diameter sub-scale low mass launcher system; 2) a sub-scale full mass launcher system; and 3) a full size and mass launcher system to include preliminary VLS system CAD design. It is anticipated that phases one and two would be the same launcher system with different projectiles; since this would be the most economical approach. (a)  Sub-scale low mass launcher.  This launcher would be used to develop the basic motor control capability and demonstrate the controlled launch of a low mass projectile. The proposed system will have the minimum specifications: i.)  The inner radius of the launch tube must be sized in order to accommodate the launch of a Navy 5 round;ii) The TLIM launcher tube will not be longer than one meter (m) in length;iii) Must demonstrate a projectile exit velocity of 60 meters per second (m/s) or greater;iv) The demonstration projectile must be at least 50 kilograms (kg).
(b)  Sub-scale full mass launcher. The launcher developed in phase one would be            used to launch SM-3 mass equivalent projectile.  The proposed system will have the minimum specifications:i) The inner radius of the launch tube must be sized in order to accommodate the launch of a Navy 5 round;ii) The TLIM launcher tube will not be longer than one meter (m) in length;iii) The projectile mass must be at least equal to a SM-3 full up round;iv)  Must demonstrate a projectile exit velocity of 45 m/s or greater.
(c)  Full-scale full mass SM-3 replica launch canister. The launcher would be a full length demonstrator capable of launching a SM-3 full up round replica at full mass and a preliminary CAD design for VLS capable of holding the TLIM canister that is compatible with CG(X) form and fit.  The proposed system will have the minimum specifications:i)   The armature must be able to securely hold the SM-3 replica until released for launch;ii)   The projectile will be an unguided inert full sized and full mass SM-3 	full up round replica;iii)  The armature must be captured within the launch canister;iv)  The SM-3 replica projectile must not be damaged from launch and the 	projectile must be reusable to support multiple launch tests and demonstrations; v)  Must demonstrate a SM-3 replica projectile exit velocity of 45 m/s or greater with acceleration not to exceed 20 Gees.
HEEL DEMONSTRATOR REQUIREMENTS
(1)  HEEL is a true AC TLIM technology that simulations have shown to be capable of producing 100s of thousand of Gees of acceleration. A HEEL system is envisioned to be comprised of nine major components: 1) a composite launcher holding the stator coils of the linear motor; 2) a  projectile that represents the armature of the linear motor; 3) Solid-state inverters to drive the stators; 4) energy storage; 5) armature position and velocity measuring capability; 6) motor control software and hardware; 7) launcher tube mounting structure; 8) projectile capture system; and 9) data acquisition and reduction.
	(2)  HEEL Requirements.  Proposals should address a minimum of a three phase 	demonstration approach: 1) a low mass launch at 500 m/s; 2) a low mass launch at 1000 	m/s; and 3) a low mass launch at 3 km/s or greater. It is anticipated that all phases would 	utilize the same launcher system. The projectile itself will be the armature, there will be 	no bucket.	(a)  Demonstration of a 500 m/s launch.  This phase would be used to develop the basic 	motor control capability and demonstrate the controlled launch of a low mass projectile at 	500 m/s or greater. The proposed system will have the minimum specifications:i) The inner radius of the launch tube must be sized in order to accommodate the launch of a Navy 5 round;ii) Launcher tube will not be longer than 1 m in length;iii) Demonstrate a projectile exit velocity of 500 m/s or greater;iv) Projectile must be at least 1 kg; v) Demonstrate a constant acceleration until the point the projectile starts to exit                      the launch tube;  vi) Demonstrate control of launch acceleration and exit velocity.
(b)   Demonstration of a 1 km/s launch. This phase would be used to further refine the control software and demonstrate the controlled launch of a low mass projectile at 1 km/s or greater.

<DESC>This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) and no formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this request will be issued.  The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) will not issue paper copies of this request.  The responses to this RFI will be considered in the planning and definition of Future Naval Capabilities programs.  This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request.  The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request.  

This Sources Sought Announcement issued by NRL solicits industry and academic Sources to express  their capability to provide advanced rudder coating systems for U.S. Navy ships.  As discussed in more detail below, NRL seeks to develop new processes to increase substantially the performance of current coating systems. 

Contractors are encouraged to consider novel organic, inorganic, or hybrid resins and / or application processes to achieve the desired goals.   In concert with consideration of new processes and materials, the Navy has also established goals which will also govern the development options.  These are established with the intent of making near-final products available to the fleet by Government Fiscal Year 2011 (Starting October 2010).  These supplementary goals include:  (a)  a goal of developing solvent and HAP free coatings but in no case should the VOC / HAP content exceed 95 g/l, (b) coating application should be via currently available technologyexceptions must be justified by cost / performance benefits and the alternative application process must be otherwise commercially available by October 2010, (c) resin choices should focus on available or nearly available technologies or combinations thereof to minimize the technology readiness (by October 2010) risk, (d) all coating shall meet the hazardous pigment, additive and toxicity requirements of the referenced military specificationsexceptions must be identified and justified on the basis of performance, and (e) recommended systems must also have a field repair technologyoptimally this should also be a new technology (i.e., improved product)alternatively current use materials might be considered as a short term repair and the new technology products would have to be compatible with them.

To support the aggressive technology development / field demonstration schedule, an additional requirement is for the Source to demonstrate the capacity within any resultant contract to provide the Navy with substantial volumes of test coatings (e.g., > 50 gallons) to facilitate test applications shipboard.  Collaboration and teaming between material / process developers and larger scale coating manufacturers is encouraged to achieve the technical goals and manufacturing capacity.  

 The improved rudder coatings shall meet or exceed the 6-month, magnesium anode, cathodic disbondment requirement of MIL-PRF-23236C.  In NRL-designed flow channel tests, these coatings shall out-perform current rudder coating systems which are based on a trowel-applied epoxy mastic technology at ~ -inch thickness.  The new coating shall improve cavitation resistance by a factor of 50% and erosion resistance by 20% versus current Navy standards.  NRL has also identified rudder flexing (or oil-canning) as a factor in the failure.   The coatings can be subject to considerable strain as the result of the rudder flex, especially under dynamic conditions.  The selection of resins must balance the yield strength / fracture energy requirements possibility needed to enhance cavitation resistance with the ductility sought to overcome the local strain effects.  These are key considerations for improved rudder coatings.  These systems should have a minimum service life of 2 to 5 years.  NRL is also seeking the co-development based on an extension of current submarine technology, of syntactic (closed cell) foam that might be installed into existing rudders to eliminate / reduce the rudder flex and extend the coating life.  The syntactic foam would be installed in addition to the improved rudder coating to extend the life of the rudder system to 7 years without excessive disbondment.  Key issues for the syntactic installation are a process and material that will allow the (near) complete filling of an internally-reinforced rudder from one fill point.  Nominal dimensions for design consideration include a fill depth of 15-feet and a cross-sectional area of nominally 5-feet by 1-foot.  Internal cross bracing is placed on nominal 2-foot centers and contains multiple through-holes within the brace-webbing.  The syntactic material should demonstrate a high compressive strength (> 4,000 psi), light weight (S.G. < 0.75), and preserve buoyancy if the rudder shell is breached. 

Field testing will eventually include testing of the improved coatings alone and as a system with the syntactic foam.  Coatings offered for evaluation should consider the tradeoff between increased film thickness, which is offered for improved erosion / cavitation resistance, vs. the increased cracking tendency for thick-films at points of maximum strain.  Coating systems may also consist of one or more coats, including consideration of flex / cathodic disbondment resistant primers and erosion / cavitation resistant topcoats.

The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request.  
This Sources Sought Announcement issued by NRL solicits industry and academic Sources to express their capability to provide advanced topside coating systems for U.S. Navy ships.   As discussed in more detail below, NRL seeks to develop new processes to increase substantially the performance of current coating systems.  The Navy considers current products as 18-month systems and wishes to extend the service life to between 3 and 5 years.
Contractors are encouraged to consider novel organic, inorganic, or hybrid resins and / or application processes to achieve the desired goals.   In concert with consideration of new processes and materials, the Navy has also established goals which will also govern the development options.

These enhanced performance topside coatings shall meet or exceed all of the key performance requirements of MIL-PRF-24635D (i.e., color / gloss retention) and should include 10% or more improved Low Solar Absorbance performance vs. current materials without adverse color changes / color stability concerns.  The coatings should also possess easy-clean properties, i.e., color / gloss shall be restored with a water wash / brush.    Three systems are sought:  a five-year, two-component, rapid cure system for new construction or depot level application; a five-year, two-component traditional cure rate system for depot level application; and a three-year, single component system for easy application by ships force.  While there are no preconceived restrictions on resin choice, the single component system has to be compatible with the two-component system. Ideally these systems should be direct-to-metal products (either aluminum or steel substrates).  The offeror should discuss the need for a primer for the proposed materials.  For complex-shape topside areas, the Navy would also seek edge-retentive properties in the coating.   The Navy would like to see alternatives based on polyurethanes, polysiloxanes, or other modern materials.  All systems should be HAP free.  The two-component systems should be (near) solvent free and the single component system shall have a VOC < 95 g/l.   Ideally, systems should also be compatible with remaining supplies of MIL-PRF-24635D.

Alternatively Hard Copies (1 original + 2 copies) may be mailed to the Points of Contact.  All White Papers must be received by the requested due date.

Sources are encouraged to present coating systems in one of three areas: two-component, 100% solids, rapid cure; two-component, traditional cure; and a single component system. (A separate White Paper should be submitted for each coating classification.)   The White Paper should (a) outline the proposed chemistry, (b) present a rationale basis for meeting the expected performance, (c) provide a rough order of magnitude of the coating cost, and (d) the expected installation and maintenance process.

In general the goal is to extend the service life by a factor of 2 for issues of weatherability, color / gloss retention, and extended service life in aircraft landing areas from 10,000 to 20,000 landings.  There is also a need to withstand, unchanged, repeated exposure to temperatures of 500 oF to 900 oF for periods of 1 to 30 minutes without deterioration.  Other required performance issues include not impacting wear of aircraft arresting cables, processes for field / ships force maintenance, and maintaining a minimum coefficient of friction.


Submissions

To minimize costs to potential contractors in responding to the subject announcement, each contractor is encouraged to submit an initial White Paper of no more than five (5) pages in length for each specific coating technology offered.  A single Source may submit multiple White Papers.  White Papers may be submitted via e-mail to the Points of Contact Listed below.  Alternatively Hard Copies (1 original + 2 copies) may be mailed to the Points of Contact.  All White Papers must be received by the requested due date.

Sources are encouraged to present coating chemistries in one of three areas: organic based coatings, inorganic based coatings, and hybrid materials.  (A separate White Paper should be submitted for each coating classification.)   The White Paper should (a) outline the proposed chemistry, (b) present a rationale basis for meeting the expected performance, (c) provide a rough order of magnitude of the coating cost, and (d) the expected installation and maintenance process.  In the outline of the proposed chemistry, the submission should discuss not simply the ability of the materials to resist the temperature extremes, but also address how the coating materials will be applied and cured (or otherwise adhered) on the ship-deck.  The submission should also present an expected upper operating temperature range for the coating / deck covering.
 
The Navy requests that White Papers be provided by June 9, 2008.  The Navy desires to initiate laboratory testing on initial trial products by July 2008.   Items (a) through (d) listed above, technology maturity, and manufacturing capacity.  Each Source should also provide a two (2) page maximum resume or curriculum vitae for the Principal Investigator.  

Each potential Source should identify the Advance Coating Technology area being presented for consideration.  The document header or title should include one, and only one, of the following:  Non-Skid (Organic), Non-Skid (Inorganic), or Non-Skid (Hybrid).

Immediate questions should be addressed in writing to Mr. James Martin, Naval Research Laboratory, Code 6130, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington, DC 20375-5342.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for Quotation<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>	Europe Region seeks approval to initiate the standardization process for IV Gravity Tubing and Accessory products for its 55 Army, Navy, and US Air Force medical facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia.  Standardization for this product line, IV Gravity Tubing and Accessory products, represents new or first-time initiative for the Europe Region.  This product line includes the following products in the following sizes. <BR>1.	IV Gravity Tubing Needle -Free Sets with drip rates from 15, 20, 60 or 10-15 drops/minute, vented/non- vented drip chamber, w/wo buretrol/volutrol, and tubing of various lengths from 15-120 inches.<BR>2.	IV Tubing Accessory - Connector-Adapters sizes: short, regular, long.<BR>3.	IV Tubing Accessory - IV Extensions sizes small bore, standard bore, macrobore, microbore and tubing of various lengths from 4 - 96 inches, w/wo filter, w/ wo anti-siphon valve.<BR>4.	IV Tubing Accessory - Secondary IV Sets 15, 20, 10-15 drops/minute and tubing of various lengths from 32-50 inches.<BR>5.	IV Tubing Accessory  Stopcocks styles 2 way, 3 way, and 4 way.<BR>6.	IV Tubing Accessory - Manifolds 3 ports.<BR>7.	IV Tubing Accessory  Caps styles male, female, female/male.<BR><BR>Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR><BR>	The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>	The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>	This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program, and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>	The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is September 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.

Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>	DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address), and all answers to the technical/company criteria to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) will be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>	This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. All email communications between vendors and the Europe Region will be digitally signed by the issuer.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>	The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>	Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.    After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as          follows: <BR>a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: <BR>	1) Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence 		that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical 		standards of care of the community applicable to such products or 			services.<BR>2)  The vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>b.	Each technical/company criteria below require additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual criterion.   <BR>2.  The vendors who meet the following technical /company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an e-mail communication with each vendor.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.

(Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)<BR>4.	Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Vendor must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for IV Gravity Tubing & Accessory products including dates, duration, cause, and resolution in response to this RFQ. Vendors will not have the opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.  <BR>7.	Vendor must provide a statement confirming their products meet the industry production and safety standards, i.e. FDA guidance for Intravascular Administration Sets Pre-Market Notification Submissions [510(k)], used in manufacturing IV Gravity Tubing & Accessory products in response to this RFQ.<BR>8.

Vendor must provide statement revealing all products containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) are clearly labeled as latex free/safe and DEHP free in response to this RFQ.<BR>10.	Vendor must provide documentation if your IV Gravity Tubing & Accessory products are incompatible with any intravenous fluids/medications in response to this RFQ.<BR>11.	Vendor must provide documentation explaining how much dead space exists between the most distal injection port and the distal end of the IV tubing in response to this RFQ.<BR>12.	Vendor must provide a statement confirming products come in a sterile package in response to this RFQ.<BR>13.	Vendor must provide a statement confirming the products package label states: the contents, expiration date, and Lot Number in response to this RFQ.<BR>14.	Samples and/ or literature will be furnished at (no charge) to the government.  Vendor must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delays that occur with Europes Custom Offices.  Provide acknowledgement of this requirement in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using hands on evaluation of samples in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (011-49-6221-172108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB 5:00PM EST on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.<BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  The following product line items have repetitive performance criteria.  Each performance criteria will be justified only once to prevent redundancy.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR> <BR>	Vendor products meet the Clinically Acceptable Target Threshold of 3.00<BR><BR>1.	(Patient safety) The drip chamber is clear and allows visualization of drops.<BR>		a. Promotes accurate drip rate to deliver proper amount of fluid/drug 					prescribed<BR>		b. This criterion will be evaluated 3 times by each participating MTF 						using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (non-patient)				setting.	<BR>2.	(Accidental kinking-patient safety) The IV tubing is pliable and is memory free.<BR>		a. Promotes an accurate and timely amount of medication and volume of 					fluid delivered during patient mobility/change in position.<BR>		b. This criterion will be evaluated 3 times by each participating MTF 						using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (non-patient)  				setting.<BR>3.	(Urgent patient care settings, patient safety) IV tubing allows an effective priming speed, flow <BR>             rate and stopcock function.<BR>		a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to prime tubing with fluid 						in an urgent care setting for patient care needs.<BR>		b. Promotes accurate drip rate to deliver proper amount of 							fluid/medication prescribed.<BR>		c. When multiple medications are connected to a gravity tubing system the 					stopcock controls which medications are being delivered to the 						patient.<BR>		d. This criterion will be evaluated 3 times by each participating MTF 						using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (non-patient)				setting.<BR>4.	(Patient safety) The buretrol (or volutrol) graduation allows visualization of an accurate <BR>             volume level.<BR>		a. Promotes an accurate amount of medication and volume of fluid 						delivered to prevent fluid overload when indicated.<BR>		b. This criterion will be evaluated 3 times by each participating MTF 						using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (non-patient)				setting.<BR>5.	(Urgent patient care settings) Product item package identifies the type of IV tubing set.<BR>		a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to select the appropriate 						size for patient care needs.<BR>		b. This criterion will be evaluated 3 times by each participating MTF using each					product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.<BR><BR>	Phase III - Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume of 80% of the total Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided fourteen (14) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:<BR>1.	The impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) is considered more important than the other pricing elements.<BR>2.	Impact of Unmatched Lines.<BR>3.	Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Europe Region intends to reduce the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best value solution for the government in this standardization initiative.<BR>

This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is September 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for CSR Wraps product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for CSR Wraps product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.   <BR><BR>Point of Contact:  Floria Jones, (706) 787-2094, floria.jones@us.army.mil; or Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Sterilization Packaging Supplies and Peel Packs which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $36,102.71.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.   Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required certifications & documentation to the enclosed POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  a.) In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR> The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Sterilization Packaging Supplies and Peel Packs products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>a.	At a minimum this includes Sterilization Packaging Supplies and Peel Packs in paper/plastic, self-sealing Peel Packs (with or without indicator strips) compatible with appropriate temperatures in the sizes of 3.5 x 8.5, 5.25 x 10.25, 7.5 x 13.5, and 12.0 x 15.5.<BR>b.	Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed above. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>c.	Vendors MUST provide supporting documentation that all Sterilization Packaging Supplies and Peel Packs that are manufactured and/or distributed are FDA approved, and provide supporting documentation to support this requirement with the initial submittal.  <BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for Sterilization Packaging Supplies and Peel Packs.  Provide the DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors who do not have a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the Southeast Regions prime vendor is Owens & Minor) for distribution in the Southeast Region.  Provide supporting documentation (four digit code) with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)   <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendors MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with initial submittal.  <BR>6.	Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Sterilization Packaging Supplies and Peel Packs products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	Vendor MUST provide Latex free/safe products.  Vendor MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to RFQ with initial submittal.  <BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  <BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-most acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 15 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting.   <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  Vendor products meet the Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0. <BR>1.	Sterilization peel packs (pouch) seals are consistent, strong and minimizes any shattering or tearing.<BR>a.	Sterilization peel packs (pouch) must remain intact to prevent contamination.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated one (1) trial for each pouch size in the non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.<BR>c.	The sterilized pouch will be visually and physically inspected for closure integrity any tears to pouch.<BR>2.	Sterilization peel packs (pouch) when peeled apart, provide a clean separation of the film from the paper, maintaining the sterile integrity of the contents.<BR>a.	The adhesive film on the peel pack (pouch) must not come in contact with package content to maintain sterility of package content.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial for each pouch size in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting. <BR>c.	The evaluator will peel the processed pouch and visually inspect for adhesive film on pouch paper and for film on pouch contents. <BR>	<BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold (-- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>(4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.

This is a Request For Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP).

The ACFO-FS accomplishes this by maintaining the corporate financial management system, the Foundation Financial Information System, corporate reporting through the Financial Statement Data Warehouse, agency reporting thorough the Financial Data Warehouse, an Automated Cash Reconciliation Work Sheet used for daily reconciliation with the United States Treasury, the Purchase Card Management System, the Travel System, the Personal Property System, and the Purchase Order System.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), Program Executive Office- Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (PEO-C4I), ProgramOffice PMW 150 intends to award a sole source Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF)contract to Northrop Grumman Space and Mission Systems, Command and ControlSystems Division, 12011 Sunset Hills Road, Reston, VA, 20190.  Northrop Grummanwill provide an additional 12 months of GCCS-M Increment 2 software developmentand systems engineering services, with an option to extend services through theMilestone C threshold date or 30 April 2010, whichever is later.  GCCS-M isscheduled to achieve Milestone C in Q1 FY10.  Past experience has identifiedthat deficiencies recognized during developmental testing will need to be fixedto achieve a Milestone C decision.  As the prime developer and integrator ofGCCS-M, the continued support of Northrop Grumman is critical to obtain a MS Cdecision.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts which will increase each contracts capacity and extend each contracts ordering period consistent with the terms identified within this announcement.  The FRR program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price and/or time and materials task orders which are placed against four (4) ID/IQ contracts in order to provide quick response for facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, additions, construction, equipment procurement / installation, and maintenance services on installed equipment/systems at Government installations and facilities.  All current contract awards were made under full and open competition procedures.  Modifications were executed in January 2008 to extend the contracts to 7 July 2008.  The solicitation(s) for the follow-on acquisitions has been released and the awards are expected to be made in Summer 2008.  Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the current contracts be extended to compensate for the period in which there would have been no contract coverage.  Therefore, it is the Governments intention to modify the current FRR ID/IQ contracts to extend the ordering period by three (3) months option period.  Once the follow-on acquisitions are awarded, ordering against the current contracts will cease.<BR><BR>The programmatic capacity established at time of award of the current contracts was established at $355 million over a total possible five (5) year ordering period (one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods).  This capacity was established prior to the award of the contracts based on an analysis of  the type of work required, anticipated workload, effects on competition, the capability of small businesses to compete for the required work, and upon historical FRR contract/program data.  Additionally, modifications were executed to increase the programmatic capacity to $425.4 million.  Based on current in-house requirements, as well as other known requirements, it is necessary that the contracts again be modified to allow for additional capacity to cover the extended ordering period.  Based upon future anticipated requirements and taking into consideration current known requirements, it is necessary that the Government modify the current contracts to increase the capacity by $30 million.  The Government reserves the right to unilaterally modify the capacity of each contract award, within the Governments sound discretion, in order to adjust for changes in performance capabilities.  Upon award of the follow-on acquisitions, new task orders will not be placed against the current contracts despite any remaining capacity.<BR><BR>The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  DACA87-02-D-0035 (BMAR and Associates), DACA87-03-D-0004 (RCI, Inc.) DACA87-03-D-0006 (Vanguard Contractors LLC) and DACA87-03-D-0007 (Ameresco Solutions, Inc.).  The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged.  <BR><BR>The Government intends to award the modifications to these contracts consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy based.  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances.  Due to the unique prior experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring need for facility repairs and renovations, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.  The Government will synopsize the contract modifications after award.

DLAD 52.233-9000 AGENCY PROTESTS (SEP 1999)

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activitys Chief of the Contracting Office.  Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979.  (Note:  DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officers decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer).  Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.
(End of Provision)

DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES:  AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) (JUN 2001)

(a)  The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise.

Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.

(b)  Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party.  The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1).  Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.

(c)  If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here (  ).  Alternate wording may be negotiated with the Contracting Officer.
(End of Provision)

OFFER SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  Quotes must include the following items.  Submission of a quote that does not contain all items requested below may result in elimination from consideration for award.

The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions.  Therefore, contractors initial offers should contain their best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary by the Contracting Officer. 

1.  Quotations may be submitted in contractor format and shall include:  (1) Company name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and FAX number; (2) Solicitation number; (3) Unit Price and extended prices for all CLINS; (4) Contractor DUNS Number and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, (5) Signed acknowledgements of amendments (applicable only if any amendments are issued against this solicitation).

2. Technical Proposal  Offerors shall submit a technical proposal which describes their  technical capability to perform the work effort as specified in the Statement of Work.  Proposals shall address the following:
a. A detailed description of the processes and procedures used to perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of scales.
b. A detailed description of the duties for each position that will perform tasks under the Statement of Work, including requirements for training, licenses and/or certifications, and the minimum number of years experience that personnel are required to have to perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of scales.

3. Past Performance  Offerors shall describe their background, knowledge and experience relating to the performance of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of scales.  Offerors shall provide a description of their experience for any Government or commercial contracts, either as a prime or sub-contractor, performed during the previous three (3) years.  A brief narrative of each contract shall be provided to include its scope of work and similarity with this requirement.  The description shall include information in the following format for each contract deemed relevant:
a. Contract number
b. Customer name and address
c. Point of Contact and telephone number
d. Dollar amount of contract and delivery schedule
e. Sample list of services provided

4.  Contractors are required to include a copy of the FAR provision 52.212-3-Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items and DFAR 252.212-7000-Offeror Representation and Certification-Commercial Items with its proposal or may indicate completion of the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include the certifications along with the price proposal or to complete the certifications on the internet may result in elimination from consideration for award.

EVALUATION  Quotes will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106.  The Government intends to award one contract to the responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1  Technical capability of the contractor to meet the Governments requirement in the Statement of Work, and Factor 2  Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a go on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offerors past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.

Factor 1 - Technical capability of the contractor to provide services as specified in the Statement of Work.  The technical proposal must demonstrate a clear understanding of the nature and scope of work required, and must comply with the requirements of law, regulation, and all conditions set forth in this solicitation.  Evaluation of the technical proposal will be a subjective assessment based on the consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  The Government is seeking to determine if the offeror demonstrates an acceptable understanding of the scope and complexity of work, as well as to provide assurance that the offeror will satisfy the performance requirements. The Government does not assume a duty to search for clarification data to cure problems or inconsistencies with an offerors proposal.  Failure to provide a realistic, reasonable and complete technical proposal may result in a determination that the offerors proposal is unacceptable.  

Factor 2  Under the past performance factor, evaluation of an offerors present and past work record will be used to assess the Governments confidence in the offerors ability to  successfully perform under the resultant contract.  The Government will evaluate the offerors record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offerors adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offerors reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offerors business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

All offers shall be in the English language and in dollars.  All interested suppliers may submit an offer.  

22 - The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if issued under a basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely in the discretion of the Government.  Information requests will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

26  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer of their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 


The solicitation will be available in FebBizOpps on its issue date of 05/23/08.    Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for data analysis prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is AG-024B-S-08-9009.  The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-25. This procurement is a small business set-aside. The NAICS Code applicable to this RFQ is 541990. The small business size standard is $6.5 million.  Task Summary:  Provide incident procurement data analysis support, to include (1) running a variety of incident expenditure and labor rate reports at the macro and micro level, (2) analyzing the data to set the baseline for contract expenditures at incidents for specified equipment and services categories, (3) identifying trends in incident procurement expenditures, and (4) developing a methodology for tracking actual expenditures and projected expenditures against agency baselines.  Background:  The Fire Equipment, Services, and Supplies Acquisition Analysis (FESSAA) team is part of the Acquisition Management staff at the USDA Forest Service.  FESSAA is tasked with performing method of supply analysis for major categories of preseason incident procurement (e.g. preseason incident agreements, national contracts, and purchase card expenditures).  A key part of method of supply analysis is the development of an appropriate baseline for expenditures, against which implemented process improvements can be assessed to determine cost savings.  Multiple Forest Service and interagency systems contain information that the contractor will analyze, including: the Resource Ordering and Status System (ROSS), I-Suite, the Incident Business Database (IBDB), the Purchase Card Management System (PCMS), the Equipment and Training Inventory System (EATIS), and the Emergency Equipment Rental Agreement (EERA) database.   Anticipated Methodology:  The contractor will review system information (both that run by the contractor and government-provided information) and estimate the level of difficulty (including estimated timeframe) for analysis of key information from each system that pertains to a government research / analysis question (see below).  The contractor will then work with the government to prioritize analytical questions to be answered, with the goal of answering key research / analysis questions in a high-quality, duplicable manner during the course of the project.  Some analyses will lead to additional research questions - therefore, a complete list of questions cannot be provided at this time.  Examples of research questions / analyses are listed below.  In addition to the research questions, the contractor will assist the agency in developing a methodology for tracking actual and projected expenditures against agency baselines, which will take into account information to be collected, a process for information collection, and a format / formula for savings calculation.  Examples of Research Questions Asked / Analyses to be Conducted:  1) How much does the Forest Service spend on incident contractor support? 1a. How much was expended on contractors for incident support in 2005 (versus the total agency expenditure, acres burned, number of incidents, days of support provided, etc.)?  Focus will be specifically on EERAs.  This will set the baseline for contractor expenditure, against which future years will be measured.  1b. Have there been any trends in contractor expenditure over the last three years?  1c.  What is the division (estimated) of expenditures between national contracts (excl. aviation), preseason incident agreements, aviation contracts, and purchase card expenditures?  2) Within the preseason incident agreement category, what are the major areas of expenditure by equipment type (by day, by total, etc)?  How many days of support is the agency using, on average, within each major equipment category?  Do any significant differences in labor rate pricing exist between locations? (note that some locations use a variety of factors to determine total payment, so the labor rate per day or per hour would not be all-encompassing)  3) What are the major categories of incident expenditure on the purchase card?  The Forest Service is particularly interested in expenditure on rental cars and bottled water / other water services.  4) Does the size of the incident impact the anticipated resource mix (larger incidents use more resources, but does the mix of resources remain the same)?  Deliverable:  The contractor will provide excel spreadsheets and a summary of the analysis and findings to the FESSAA team.  Electronic submission of analysis is acceptable (paper copies are not required).  An oral report-out may also be required.   Skill Sets Desired:  Background in financial systems analysis, including very strong Microsoft Excel database skills (e.g. pivot tables, formulas, etc).  Experience working with Forest Service / Interagency systems identified above is strongly preferred.  Understanding of incident procurement is preferred, but not required.  Respondents should highlight their experience in the following areas: (1) financial analysis, (2) working with MS Excel databases, (3) experience working with identified systems, (4) knowledge of incident procurement requirements / processes, and (5) statistical analysis and sampling.  Estimated Timeframe:  It is estimated that work will start June 16, 2008.  An introductory meeting will be held, where work priorities will be agreed upon, and interim due dates negotiated to ensure satisfactory progression of work.  Work on the agreed upon, prioritized tasks shall begin within two weeks of the kickoff/introductory meeting.   The EERA portion of the analysis must be completed no later than September 30, 2008.  All work shall be completed by May 31, 2009.  This contract is estimated not to exceed 640 hours.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government. Quotes in response to this solicitation will be evaluated considering price and experience.  Proposal Preparation Instructions:  Contractor shall provide information including your company information (name, address, primary point of contact and contact information including phone number and e-mail address), DUNS number, a short summary of applicable work experience (no longer than 1 page), addressing the skill sets identified above, and a price quotation (hourly rate).

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Research Systems, Inc. (dba: ITT Visual Information Solutions). This combined synopsis/solicitation is posted with the intent of awarding to Research Systems, Inc. (dba: ITT Visual Information Solutions), 4990 Pearl East Circle, Boulder, CO 80301-2530. 

These items are the sole proprietary product of the vendor and no other authorized resellers are anticipated. The requirement is for the following ENVI items: 

CLIN0001: P/N  29WINFLLIC ENVI Feature Extraction Module Windows Floating License with Maintenance.    (Qty = 1), 
CLIN0002: P/N  230WINFLUPG Upgrade ENVI-NITF Module to ENVI NITF Module with TFRD Windows Floating License (Qty = 3),  
CLIN0003: P/N  230WINFLUPG Upgrade ENVI-NITF Module to ENVI NITF Module with TFRD Windows Floating License (Qty = 6), 
CLIN0004: P/N -  20WINFLUPG Upgrade ENVI+IDL Windows SN License to ENVI+IDL Windows FL (Qty = 6), 

Period of performance should cover timeframe from Award to 06/30/2008.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: ENVI is a proprietary software application made by ITT Visual Information Solutions. Selection of a different product would not be compatible with our customers needs as this software is used to support Research and Development of exploitation and analysis algorithms and tools that will immediately be compliant and interface with the NGA legacy Systems. New tools and algorithms are tested in a simulated operational environment to determine if and how they will function when placed in research and development using these applications. Due to the fact that this software is already integrated into the NGA enterprise it would be extremely costly for the Agency to switch to a new type of software. A switch at this juncture would cause personnel to have to be trained to use new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to the implementation of any new software.

Delivery is FOB Destination for CLIN0001 & CLIN0002 to NGA Washington, Attn: Dan West/PL/MS:  N-52, PLFY08-2065, 1200 First Street, SE, Washington, DC 20303 and for CLIN0003 & CLIN0004 to NGA Washington, Attn: Dave Bonner/PKSS/MS:  N-24, PKFY08-2139, 1200 First Street, SE, Washington, DC 20303  in the quantities listed above.
Quotes should contain pricing with any applicable discounts applied.  Maintenance should be pro-rated to end on 06/30/2008.   All boxes must be sealed and unopened. Total cost shall include all shipping and handling. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, with no obligation to the offeror by the Government.

The RFID system shall include the following features to meet the NIH Librarys needs:  (1) read-write, ISO standard compliant tag with memory chip that identifies and tracks books; (2)  security chip added to the tag to protect the books from theft; (3) conversion station, that converts IDs from bar code labels to item identifiers on RFID tags, automatically dispenses tags, allows programming and reprogramming tag information; (4) staff pad workstation that allows staff to check-out/check-in books for library users and functions as conversion station; (5) ADA compliant RFID sensor security gates: one dual aisle and one single aisle, including software to identify unauthorized items leaving the library; (6) hand held reader for inventory control that can be moved rapidly across a shelf of books and journals to shelf read all the unique identification information, sort data, locate misplaced books and journals, and download data into the Millennium integrated library system; (7) SIP2 compatible patron self-check kiosks with touch screen computer, built-in RFID tag reader, and built-in receipt printer; (8) book drop that turns on security bit, removes the item from patrons account, and returns item to circulation.    

In order for the Millennium integrated library system to read item identifiers from RFID tags to access the associated record in Millennium (for example, by a staff member using Millennium Circulation at the information service desk, or by a patron using Millenniums Graphical Patron Self Check-Out software), and to maintain the security bit, the RFID system shall provide the following functionality:

-Presents individual access to each workstations RFID read or write hardware as a TCP/IP accessible Web Service

-Presents such individualized access either by offering a unique IP address for each workstations RFID read or write hardware, or by hosting the software implementing the Web Service for a particular workstations RFID read or write hardware on the same workstation as the Millennium client application so that the TCP/IP loopback facility may be used for communication

-Support in the above described Web Service to deliver, in response to a request from Millennium, a list of individual item identifiers from RFID tags which are considered at the time of the request to be in range of the RFID hardware, for example, in the case of a typical RFID pad enclosure, the items which are currently atop the pad.  Additionally:

-Repeated requests to the Web Service should deliver the same data on subsequent requests if the same items remain in range
-Web Service should support (at a minimum) one request per second
-Web Service should be non blocking, providing an error response if it is unable to respond immediately to a request

Statement Of Work:
Summary

The west side passenger elevator in the Gus Solomon Building has been out of service for several weeks because of a short to ground in the motor armature presumed to have been caused by a sheet metal screw falling onto the energized armature from the ceiling. 

Purpose

The purpose of this work is to get the elevator repaired and back in service as soon as possible at a reasonable cost to the government. An alternative to repairing the existing armature is to purchase and install a new gearless hoisting machine if it will not add significant time or cost to the Government. A new geared machine could be considered if it is feasible to make alterations to accommodate the configuration of the existing machine room

 Requirements

1. Contractor shall investigate conditions and make recommendations on the feasibility of a repair or replacement.  Contractor shall provide recommendations in their firms quotation to the Government.  
2. Contractor shall review the Statement of Services and may participate in walk-through of the service site to demonstrate an understanding of the requirements when submitting a quotation to the Government.
3. The contractor, based on the requirements and the site visit, shall examine the following options and provide the Government with a quotation that addresses the contractors findings, recommendations, anticipated time line, and price for each option that the contractor deems to be feasible:
a. Option one;  Determine if the armature repair is feasible. If an armature repair is recommended, the contractor shall include motor vendors shop pricing as a separate line item presented in quotation to the Government.
b. Option two;  The alternative is possible of purchasing and installing a new gearless hoisting machine if it will not add significant time or cost to the Government.
c. Option three; A new geared machine could be considered if it is feasible to make alterations to accommodate this configuration in the existing machine room.
d. Option four; any contractor discovered option.

4. Upon review of the requirements and/or examination of the elevators current condition that contractor shall determine if craning machine assemblies to the roof are necessary for the repair, the contractor shall provide a structure evaluation of the roof and submit this evaluation and a roof protection plan with the Project Plan in the contractors quotation if this approach is chosen. 

5. If option one is chosen the contractor must remove armature and driver assembly from hoisting machine, separate the driver from armature, lower armature through hatch and down one of the other elevators, then transport it to and from motor repair vendor. The contractor would be required to reinstall the repaired armature to produce a completely functional and running elevator and be available for any post repair testing or inspections. New motor bearings or any other recommended upgrade should be presented to GSA if they would be prudent to sustain the life of the hoisting machine.

6. Contractor shall determine if winching machine assemblies up the stairways is necessary for the repair of the elevator. If this approach is chosen the contractor shall provide a structural evaluation of the involved building systems and submit this evaluation and structures protection plan with the Project Plan in their firms quotation.

7. Contactor shall identify all subcontractors when responding to this Request for Quote.

Additional Requirements:

a. Provide all materials, labor and vendor services required to produce a complete repair as described in this Statement of Services.
b. Unless specified otherwise, all new products are to comply with Building Standards.  Building Standards are provided in Guides and Standards section of the SOS.
c. Contractor shall clean area and remove all trash created by the contractor on a daily basis; dust and other airborne materials are to be contained and removed.   Contractor shall provide their own waste removal.  The existing building solid waste disposal system is not to be used for construction waste.
d. Contractor shall develop and implement a waste management plan, quantifying materials.  Recycle and/or salvage at least 50% of construction and demolition materials.  Calculations can be done by weight or volume, but must be consistent throughout the project.
e. Contractor is responsible to secure any needed permits. GSA will provide for third party inspections if needed.

Constraints

1.The existing hatch opening is large enough to accommodate the armature so the contractor must remove armature and driver assembly from hoisting machine and separate driver from the armature before lowering it down the service hatch.

2. If the contractor wishes to use the service hatch for machine assemblies larger than the armature the contractor must submit with their proposal subcontractor costs for abatement of the pipe insulation and rerouting the two steam pipes that partially obstruct the service opening.  Alternatively, any new assemblies maybe disassembled to fit up through the hatch then reassembled.

3. The egress to the freight elevator is constructed with a wooden ramp with a rise of approximately 5/8 per foot. The weight bearing ability of this ramp is unknown. If the contractor wishes to use this ramp the contractor is responsible for the discovery of its structural integrity and for the repair costs of any damage that may incur. The freight elevator has a 42 inch door and the interior cab dimensions are 58 wide x 68 deep. It has a 2500 lb rating.

4. Rather than deal with the wooden ramp issue the contractor may chose to roll equipment across the seventh floor to the east passenger elevator. It has the same weight rating as the freight elevator (2500 lbs), a 42 door and the cab is shaped differently at 72 wide and 55 deep. The carpeting is fragile so putting down plywood is suggested.

5. NO hand trucks, carts, dollies or equipment is to be rolled through the 1st floor Broadway entrance because of damage to the pressure sensitive mats. 

6. The existing maintenance contract is with Kone.  They have done the initial disassemblyand troubleshooting. If the successful offorer is other than Kone they would need to re-hang the cab and cables and return Kones rigging to them.

7. Any new hoisting machine assemblies must be compatible with the existing Montgomery control panel	

Additional Constraints

1. Work may be performed during normal business hours which are 6am to 5pm M-F.  Work hours and schedule must be coordinated with the GSA Property Manager and the  GSA Project Manager. 
2. During business hours service site must be secured for ensure safety of all persons with appropriate signage applied to prevent entry of customers and staff.

3. Contractor is responsible to coordinate and pay the building maintenance service provider (TSSI) for their services as needed in relation to building utility systems that interface with this project.

4. Asbestos fibers have been identified in the Building Asbestos Survey in piping insulation that is in close proximity of the work site. This pipe insulation is protected by a steel jacket. If the contractor inadvertently damages materials that contain asbestos fibers GSA will manage any repair or abatement but GSA reserves the right to recover costs from the contractor. The contractor will bear any responsibility for delays in the project process caused any such damage to materials containing asbestos fibers

5. Protect finishes, equipment, carpeting, elevator doors and cab and surrounding tenants from dust and damage.

6. Coordinate access and parking with GSA Project Manger.

7. Project must be scheduled to minimize the time that adjacent spaces are off line and     unavailable for use by the building tenants.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide questions, answers, clarifications and a revised Statement of Work.  Section (v) of the original Combined Synopsis/Solicitation is replaced in its entirety below.  Interested parties should submit their quotes with this amendment.<BR><BR>Clarifications.  Server partitioning and shared drive set up will be performed by Government IT Specialists.  Server integration is not a part of this requirement.<BR><BR>Questions and Answers.  <BR><BR>1.	It is still unclear where new CAT5 Cabling is required and where EMT conduit needs to be run.  Would you please clarify this?  CAT5 Cable is no longer a requirement.  Government IT Specialists will handle all issues with server integration.<BR>2.	You did clarify in Question 3 in amendment 4 that the room connect to the network via CAT5.  May I ask for confirmation that it is in fact CAT5?  CAT5 is not necessary, G6 will take care of this portion of the customers requirement.<BR>3.	Please clarify Question 6 in amendment 4.  No server integration is required.<BR>4.	Should there be a 2 port network switch provided at each PC?  Yes, an AB switch.<BR>5.	Why is this needed?  To go back and forth and avoid damages to the equipment.<BR>6.	If so, is there a preferred model of switch?  (many networks dont like strange network appliances on them).  This is not a network switch, it should be a hard copper disconnect switch.<BR>7.	Is this a security switch, and does it need to pass any Tempest Certification? No.<BR>8.	How far from each desktop PC to Smartboard (on average).  They will be right next to each other.  Smartboard to PC will go down the wall into the PC.  Maximum cable length 15ft to PC.<BR>9.	Will the VGA & USB cables from the PC to the projector & board need to be run along the floor inside a rubber cable cover and up the wall in raceway?  Yes.<BR>10.	Is there a local monitor on each desktop PC?  Yes.<BR>11.	Repeat of Question 7 in amendment 4.  The answer was Please see breakout below of classroom power equipment needs but there is no breakout below answering this question.  Power and network requirements are not relevant to what is being quoted as amended here.  The only information provided and needed is the individual classrooms on the second and forth floors.<BR>12.	Is electrical power being provided separate from this requirement or does our quote need to provide for electrical power as well?  This is a separate requirement and should not be included in the quoted price.<BR>13.	Will there be an IT specialist available to load Smart Technologies software on Government Provided Systems?  These will be password protected and preconfigured, so Government IT help will be required.  Yes.<BR>14.	Will the IT folks set up the Shared folders on the server for each room prior to our work?  This is a Government network function and an outside contractor will not have access to do this.  Yes.<BR>15.	You specified that work must be done on weekends.  We have done other classroom projects in Bank Hall during weekday evenings.  Is this a possibility?  There is a possibility that this could be coordinated.  Coordination would be required to clear out the classrooms, even for the weekend work will require coordination to clear out the classrooms which contractors will be installing the Smartboards for the day.  Possibility, however, this cannot be guaranteed.<BR>16.	Is there a date required for project completion?  As soon as possible.<BR>17.	Are there enough open ports in the IDF closets for an additional 52 network drops?  If not, we would need to add additional patch panels.  This question should be mute based on the information provided above.  Network integration is no longer a requirement.<BR>18.	CLIN 0003 Denotes connecting to equipment that is currently installed, Rooms 236 and 266.  Please elaborate on this capability.  Need Ysplitter and audio cable to go from the PC to the smartboard.<BR>19.	Is plenum rated cable is acceptable in lieu of conduit.  Yes.  Conduit should no longer be required, plenum rated cable should only be required on the wall and to the floor for the SmartBoard to PC connection.<BR>20.	We assume that each classroom already has connectivity for the student computers.  The solicitation requirement is to connect to the network the computer which is attached to the interactive whiteboard.  We assume that it would be acceptable to place a network switch on one of the existing/working network pors and to connect to the switch the device that was previously connected on that port plus the computer connected to the interactive whiteboard.  It sounds like the assumption is here there is more than one computer, there is only one computer in each classroom which will be connected to the smartboard.<BR><BR>Section (v) of the original Combined Synopsis/Solicitation is amended to reflect:<BR><BR>(v)  This requirement is to supply and install 52 smart boards in 52 rooms at Bank Hall, Fort Bragg, NC to meet the training guidance and support the demands of enhanced testing standards.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is not a solicitation, but rather a Request for Information.  The Information Technology, E-Commerce and Commercial Contracting Center  West (ITEC4-W), located at Fort Huachuca, AZ is seeking input from potential sources that can provide Multispectral Fingerprint Capture. Multi-spectral imaging technology captures data from the surface and the subsurface of the fingertip, resulting in superior fingerprint images over a wider range of adverse environmental conditions. Thus, multi-spectral sensors are not dependent on perfect or unobstructed contact with the sensor, quality of ridges, or optimum conditions. Interested parties shall submit a capabilities statement addressing the following items:<BR><BR>"	Provide a capability statement of delivering a working multispectral sensor for integration into a mobile partner such as the Biometrics Automated Toolset (BAT). Design documentation shall be provided. <BR><BR>"	Provide a capability statement for delivering one fully functional working model of a multispectral imaging fingerprint capture device that can be integrated with the BAT. This should include delivering a software development kit to enable this integration. <BR><BR>"	Provide a capability statement for delivering 50 multispectral imaging based fingerprint capture devices that are integrated and compatible with the BAT. <BR><BR>Background. Obtaining both biometric and biographical data and enrolling individuals in a database has been the approach taken with the Biometrics Automated Toolset (BAT). Networked by approximately 75 servers, there are approximately 3000 BAT clients in use in OIF and OEF. The BAT system currently captures three biometric measurements: fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris. <BR><BR>Current fingerprint readers are prone to poor image quality under a variety of common conditions. Small amounts of contamination or excessively dry or moist skin can hamper or even preclude the capture of an acceptable fingerprint image. Further, a significant percentage of the population has fingerprints that result in consistently poor images because of genetics, poor health, age, or even profession. Ridges are sometimes worn, or they dont have enough collagen to remain firm when pressed on the platen. Conventional optical sensors are also subject to being flooded in direct sunlight and typically cannot handle extremes in temperatures. <BR><BR>Interested firms should provide a solution for multi-spectral imaging technology addressing the capabilities referenced in the above bullets.  Also interested firms should provide information stating whether this will be a new prototype or equipment currently offered commercially.  The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest and capabilities of firms who can support this requirement.  If you believe your firm can perform this type of support, the government is interested in receiving a technical capability statement.  Technical capability statements can be submitted in your own format and shall be 7 pages or less.  Interested firms should submit their written responses to the Contract Specialist, Cynthia Hall, via email:  cynthia.m.hall@us.army.mil, no later than 20 May 2008.  Any questions or concerns, please contact the Contract Specialist at 520-533-0363 or the Contracting Officer, Jadie Russell at 520-533-1694 or Technical Point of Contact (only for technical related questions), Matt Malanowski, 520-533-4665. This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>ADVANCE NOTICE
GENERAL CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This is a pre-solicitation notice to be issued as a request for proposal of a government requirement.  NAICS Code will be 562910 and the size standard is $13,000,000.  This acquisition is 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  The procurement will be conducted utilizing source selection procedures via the trade-off process under the best value continuum.  The award will be based upon the best value to the government considering tradeoffs between price and non-price related factors.  The evaluation factors have yet to be developed consequently potential offerors will need to refer to the solicitation (when issued) for the selection criteria/factors that will be evaluated by the government.  The importance and weighting of the non-price factors in relation to price has yet to be determined by the source selection authority.  The estimated range of this project is $500,000 - $1,000,000.  The government intends to award a contract without discussions with the potential contractors.  This project is subject to the Service Contract Act.  Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price.  Funds are available for the proposed action, however, if the project is cancelled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror.  Responders are advised that the requirement(s) may be delayed, cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation, and/or final award process based on decisions related to DOI and NPS changes.  Contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) government system prior to award to be eligible for a government contract - the link can be found at http://www.ccr.gov/ -- we advise potential offerors to begin the registration process when they prepare their proposal to ensure the registration in the CCR database is complete and in-place should they be selected for the award.  In the event an offeror is not registered in CCR at the time the contracting officer is ready to award the contract, the contracting officer will proceed to the next eligible successful offeror registered in the CCR database.  Refer to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, "If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  Joint Ventures are encouraged to submit a proposal, however; offerors submitting a proposal as a Joint Venture should remember that Joint Ventures must also be registered in CCR identical to the joint venture indicated in their proposal (failure to do so will make the offeror[s] ineligible for award).  The anticipated posting date to the NBC and Federal Business Opportunities Website (solicitation number N9836080021) will be on or about June 2, 2008 (subject to change) and proposals will be due on or about July 1, 2008 (subject to change).  The solicitation (and subsequent amendments if applicable) and all related documents can be downloaded electronically (once posted) from the DOI NBC Website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov/ AND the National Park Service Public ftp site (which will contain pictures, drawings, specifications, etc.).  Potential offerors must ensure their browsers are set up to view/access Public ftp sites.  NO HARD COPY DOCUMENTS WILL BE ISSUED.  Proposals must be delivered (if submitting by courier, USPS, UPS, DHL or FedEx) to the National Park Service, Alaska Regional Office, 240 West 5th Avenue, Anchorage, Alaska 99501-2327, Attention:  Gary A. Haynes, Contract Specialist, 5th Floor.  Facsimile, email or oral proposals will NOT be accepted.  Reference the solicitation number (N9836080021) on your documentation.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The successful offeror will provide all labor, materials, travel, tools, transportation, and necessary supervision to clean-up and restore portions of the few former placer mining claims on Glen Creek and one on Moose Creek in the Kantishna Hills of Denali National Park and Preserve.  Abandoned equipment and debris removal, floodplain reconstruction and excavation, treatment of contaminated soils and re-vegetation on Moose and Glen creeks, Kantishna Hills, Denali Park and Preserve, Alaska are some of the elements of work associated with this project.  The project involves four phases of action which include; 1) Equipment, structure and debris removal/disposal; 2) Removal of incidental contaminated (hydrocarbons) soils from the site; 3) Floodplain reconstruction to include stream channel relocation tailings pile reduction, valley contouring, and road-site scarification, and; 4) Re-vegetation.  The hazardous material portion of the work (phase 2) will require the preparation of appropriate plans and documents and obtainment of the associated permits as required by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  The site location is in Denali National Park and Preserve.  The Kantishna Hills Mining District can be reached by driving to Denali National Park on highway 3 (250 miles north of Anchorage or 120 miles south of Fairbanks) then traveling 92 miles to near the end of the Denali Park road.  Glen Creek is then reached by turning east on Moose Creek road (starts at the North Face Lodge parking area) traveling 6.7 miles up Moose Creek on a very rugged four-wheel drive mining trail.  The trail makes 13 crossings or fords of Moose Creek, some of which traverse directly up the rocky streambed.  The site should be considered remote.

<DESC>ADVANCE NOTICE
GENERAL CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This is a pre-solicitation notice to be issued as a request for proposal of a government requirement.  NAICS Code will be 562910 and the size standard is $13,000,000.  This acquisition is 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  The procurement will be conducted utilizing source selection procedures via the trade-off process under the best value continuum.  The award will be based upon the best value to the government considering tradeoffs between price and non-price related factors.  The evaluation factors have yet to be developed consequently potential offerors will need to refer to the solicitation (when issued) for the selection criteria/factors that will be evaluated by the government.  The importance and weighting of the non-price factors in relation to price has yet to be determined by the source selection authority.  The estimated range of this project is $500,000 - $1,000,000.  The government intends to award a contract without discussions with the potential contractors.  This project is subject to the Service Contract Act.  Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price.  Funds are available for the proposed action, however, if the project is cancelled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror.  Responders are advised that the requirement(s) may be delayed, cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation, and/or final award process based on decisions related to DOI and NPS changes.  Contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) government system prior to award to be eligible for a government contract - the link can be found at http://www.ccr.gov/ -- we advise potential offerors to begin the registration process when they prepare their proposal to ensure the registration in the CCR database is complete and in-place should they be selected for the award.  In the event an offeror is not registered in CCR at the time the contracting officer is ready to award the contract, the contracting officer will proceed to the next eligible successful offeror registered in the CCR database.  Refer to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, "If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  Joint Ventures are encouraged to submit a proposal, however; offerors submitting a proposal as a Joint Venture should remember that Joint Ventures must also be registered in CCR identical to the joint venture indicated in their proposal (failure to do so will make the offeror[s] ineligible for award).  The anticipated posting date to the NBC and Federal Business Opportunities Website (solicitation number N9836080021) will be on or about June 2, 2008 (subject to change) and proposals will be due on or about July 1, 2008 (subject to change).  The solicitation (and subsequent amendments if applicable) and all related documents can be downloaded electronically (once posted) from the DOI NBC Website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov/ AND the National Park Service Public ftp site (which will contain pictures, drawings, specifications, etc.).  Potential offerors must ensure their browsers are set up to view/access Public ftp sites.  NO HARD COPY DOCUMENTS WILL BE ISSUED.  Proposals must be delivered (if submitting by courier, USPS, UPS, DHL or FedEx) to the National Park Service, Alaska Regional Office, 240 West 5th Avenue, Anchorage, Alaska 99501-2327, Attention:  Gary A. Haynes, Contract Specialist, 5th Floor.  Facsimile, email or oral proposals will NOT be accepted.  Reference the solicitation number (N9836080021) on your documentation.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The successful offeror will provide all labor, materials, travel, tools, transportation, and necessary supervision to clean-up and restore portions of the few former placer mining claims on Glen Creek and one on Moose Creek in the Kantishna Hills of Denali National Park and Preserve.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) states that DHS S&T will support basic and applied homeland security research to promote revolutionary changes in technologies; advance the development, testing and evaluation, and deployment of critical homeland security technologies; and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that would address homeland security vulnerabilities.  Pursuant to this mission the Chemical Biological Division (CBD) seeks technologies to prevent, detect, and defend against chemical and biological attacks.  In addition, the division is charged with pursuing research to improve response and restoration, conduct threat risk assessments, and invest in bioforensics research and development.  The focus of this BAA is in the area of biological toxin detection assay research and development.

A major requirement for Department of Homeland Security is the development of bioassays that give high-confidence detection of Biothreat agents.  The goal of this research program is to develop Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays (ELISA) for the detection of biological toxins.  In order to mount a rapid and appropriate response to the release of a biological agent (toxin), the threat needs to be quickly identified and characterized.  This information is critical to allow decision makers to take the best course of action to most efficiently characterize, respond, and employ countermeasures following an incident.  Furthermore, an effort to standardize the analysis methods, techniques, and instrument platforms is ongoing, and is a major goal of the Department.

Assay Requirements for Ricin, Abrin Toxin, and Botulinum Neuro-Toxins;  
Tasks/Deliverables; and

<DESC>  1. This notice is the second of three Notices made pursuant to FAR 5.205(b) indicating The Department of Homeland Security's intent to sponsor a new Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). Specifically, DHS intends to sponsor a system engineering/systems development (SED) FFRDC to be known as the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (SEDI). The typical, but not exclusive, role of an SED FFRDC is to help DHS identify and implement technical systems engineering and acquisitions best practices in major acquisition programs that will ensure fair, efficient, effective, and open competition throughout the acquisition lifecycle. 

2. By The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (PL 107-296, as amended), Section 305, Congress authorized DHS to establish one or more FFRDCs to assist the DHS in formulating and addressing important homeland security issues, particularly those where scientific, technical and analytical expertise is involved, such as systems engineering/systems development. 

3. The entire Department of Homeland Security will be the ultimate sponsor of this new SED FFRDC; however, the Science and Technology Directorate (DHS (S&T)) should be viewed as its primary sponsor. In general, the DHS (S&T) will provide technical quality, business, financial and contractual oversight. The SED FFRDC shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsors, and to serve the unique needs of its sponsors, while holding its full confidence and trust. Any subsidiary relationship the SED FFRDC may have with a parent organization or consortia of organizations must demonstrate and maintain strict safeguards from conflicts of interest with such parent organizations. Work performed by the SEDI for non-DHS customers may be performed only with the explicit permission of DHS (S&T). 

4. The SEDI Contractor shall provide all required and necessary space, equipment, support and technical personnel (except that as may be Government furnished) to establish, set up and manage the SEDI. Performance of the SED FFRDC management function required under the Contract will take place in the Washington DC metropolitan areas, with the exception of assignees to field operations. 5. The work to be performed under this contract will involve access to, handling of and generation of classified information up to and including Top Secret and sensitive compartmented information (SCI). 

6. The Contractor shall provide a wide range of functions, including: 

	Provide technical expertise and systems engineering support to the Department in the acquisition of major homeland security systems to effectively and efficiently achieve cost, schedule and performance goals. This effort includes developing technical contract requirements and evaluating potential performers for major DHS acquisition programs; 
	Provide technical advice to DHS program offices in the management and quality control/assurance of integration and sub-system contracts in support of major acquisition programs to optimize trade-offs in meeting program cost, schedule and performance goals; 
	Develop and deploy analytical tools and techniques to evaluate sub-system alternatives and life-cycle costs that have broad application across the Department; Develop guidance for the Department to effectively manage efficient integrated business/financial, planning and budgeting systems; 
	Provide unique development test and evaluation activities, particular in areas of interoperability, information technology and information management systems; particularly in areas where competitive sourcing of these activities would not be efficient or effective; 
	Develop recommendations on best practices for software and technical data development processes at the system and sub-system levels and promote system of systems interoperability, including independent verification and validation efforts; 
	Support the development of processes and systems to acquire, manage, and use of program technical data (e.g., configuration management, logistic cycle analysis, etc.) in and across the major DHS programs; Support acquisition program risk management activities by developing analytic tools that can be applied consistently across Department programs; 
	Support interface management development activities related to sub-system integration as well as system of systems integration that contribute to a larger DHS system of system enterprise; 
	Provide independent evaluation and audit support in the development phase of major programs for sub-systems and their integration, including: performance metrics, evaluation criteria, assessment of integration contractor and sub-contractor performance, product quality assurance/control, development verification and validation studies at the sub-system levels; 
	Provide advice for standards for Homeland Security systems development and engineering best practices for an integrated DHS approach to systems acquisition; 
	Understand key homeland security organizations and their specific role, and major acquisition requirements. 

The intent of the SEDI is to provide long-term, independent and objective advice to the government, using technical talent that is generally not available inside the government. The SEDI will provide support to all major DHS components in an integrative and cross-cutting manner, with any other DHS's FFRDCs, so that over time they will provide greater synergy, best practices, and lessons learned in relevant areas. The SEDI will operate in a manner that is free of real and perceived conflicts of interest through the rigorous application of corporate firewalls and personnel conflict of interest and non-disclosure agreements approved by the DHS. Corporate entities that operate one of DHS's FFRDCs shall not be eligible to operate one of the other DHS FFRDCs, so that the FFRDCs may be used to provide independent and objective cross validation as necessary. 

7. This SED FFRDC contract has an anticipated award date in December 2008. It is anticipated that the SEDI will require startup funds to be provided from G&A; and no annual "core" funding because it is envisioned to subsist on task orders from the major DHS acquisition programs anticipated not to exceed 300 Staff-years of technical effort (STE) annually. An independent research and development (IRD) fee of about 5% will be charged to task orders. The IRD fee shall be used to develop and execute a DHS approved annual Research Plan to provide continuing development of a DHS integrative systems engineering/development process. The complete solicitation package will be available electronically at www.FBO.gov. No paper copies of the solicitation will be provided. 

8. DHS requests comments on this Notice of Intent to Sponsor a Federally Funded Research and Development Center for System Engineering Development. Any comments should be submitted electronically to sedi-ffrdc@hq.dhs.gov. Comments must be received within 90 days of the date of publication of this notice.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts extending each contracts ordering pe riod consistent with the terms identified within this announcement.  The FRR program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price and/or time and materials task orders which are placed against five (5) ID/IQ contracts in order to provide quick response for facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, additions, construction, equipment procurement / installation, and maintenance services on installed equipment/systems at Government installations and facilities.  All current contract award s were made under full and open competition procedures.  The ordering period for these contracts will expire in January 2008.  As a result, CEHNC is developing its acquisition strategy and conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on FRR acquisitions, under NAICS code 236220.  The solicitation(s) for the follow-on acquisitions were released in July 2007 with the projected awards to be made in Spring 2008.  Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the current contracts be extended to compensate  for the period in which there would have been no contract coverage.  Therefore, it is the Governments intention to modify the current FRR ID/IQ contracts to extend the ordering period by six (6) months with an additional three (3) month option period.  O nce the follow-on acquisitions are awarded, ordering against the current contracts will cease.  The Government will not exercise the additional three (3) month option should the follow-on acquisitions be awarded prior to the period in which the additional three (3) month option would be exercised.<BR><BR>The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  DACA87-02-D-0035 (BMAR and Associates), DACA87-03-D-0004 (RCI, Inc ., 8(a) Small Business), DACA87-03-D-0005 (Global Engineering & Construction LLC), DACA87-03-D-0006 (Vanguard Contractors LLC) and DACA87-03-D-0007 (Ameresco Solutions, Inc.).  The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain u nchanged.  <BR><BR>The Government intends to award the modifications to these contracts consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one r esponsible source and no other services will satisfy requirement.  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances.  Due to the unique prior experience and involvement of the curr ent contractors and the anticipated recurring need for facility repairs and renovations, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approva l prior to proceeding.  The Government will synopsize the contract modifications after award.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this no tice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability Statements submitted should demonstrate the offerors e xperience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government. The statement shall include business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements.  Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length.  Written inqu iries may be directed to Ms. Donna Parker via email at Donna.L.Parker@usace.army.mil or Mr. Adam Sunstrom via email at Adam.R.Sunstrom@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 2 is to answer the following additional question:

I have read the background requirements, but to be honest, I am a little lost on why there is a reason to try to accomplish the goal, when the only mention of money is the 150k, that is budgeted?  So how does the contractor make any money?

Answer:  The United States Mint expects that contractors will budget their fee into the $150,000.
