<ARCHDATE>01062004
<CONTACT>Dick Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>This requirement was previously announced under CBD notice #5151W9, dated 12/14/01, amended on notice #5156C5, dated 12/19/01, and publicized again under Synopsis/Solicitation Number 1435-04-02-RP-85909.  GovWorks will provide the contract support for this acquisition, and all questions will be sent to the Contracting Office by e-mail.  Any vendor contacting the program office or other related technical office for information may be disqualified from further participation.  The purpose of this synopsis is to notify potential vendors that the specifications for this requirement have been finalized and are available for review and retention, and to announce the upcoming solicitation for a contract for the JAMI JTU-II development.  The program office is a joint services Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program Office established to develop a package of integrated instrumentation components for applications in tri-service (Air Force, Army, Navy) small missile test and training applications.  The program will provide GPS/IMU based TSPI, missile/weapon attitude and vector scoring for range safety and test and evaluation applications, and will also provide a method to track missiles and targets without the relying on ground based radar by utilizing existing telemetry links and infrastructure.  The JAMI components include both airborne and ground based systems.  The high dynamic TSPI unit is the airborne component of the system.  It will provide GPS and IMU data that can be processed on the ground and refined to high accuracy.  The high dynamic TSPI unit is the purpose of this acquisition.  The TSPI unit consists of 5 primary components: (1) A GPS sensor.  An integral GPS sensor accepts RF signals from an external antenna and optional filter-limiter-amplifier (FLA) and will be selected by the missile designer to meet the requirements of the GSU specified RF input.  (2) Inertial Measurement Sensors/Unit.  Signals for internally mounted accelerometers and rate sensors are conditioned, accumulated and combined with the GPS and event time data into the JTU data output.  (3)  Data Acquisition System.  The JTU contains all signal conditioning required for IMU buffering, sampling, and digital conversion.  The acquisition system also converts the IMU data into engineering units, applies calibration corrections as required and performs quaternion calculations on the rate data.  (4) Digital Interface Formatter (processor).  The internal processor acts as an internal communications hub.  The processor formats data from the GSU and merges it with the IMU and header information.  It also provides an RS-232 interface from external sources to the GSU and monitors the selectable mode input lines to determine which protocol is used in transmitting the output data to the missile or target telemetry system.  (5) Associated Power System.  The JTU filters external 28 volt weapons power and converts it into the power forms required by the GSU, IMU and conditioning circuits.  The contractor shall design, develop, fabricate, test, and deliver the JTU in accordance with this solicitation.  The JTU high dynamic specification is available as NAWC CH-3119 Rev A, dated 12/12/02, from this web site: http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp.  Look up this RFP Number:  1435-04-03-RP-71358.  All electrical and mechanical characteristics of the JTU shall conform to the documentation provided by the government.  The JTU development shall be undertaken in two phases.  The initial effort will include the mechanical and electrical design, the selection of the IMU sensor and the software/firmware design of the internal processes as indicated by the JTU specification and the TSPI Unit Message Structure (TUMS) specification, NAWC CH-3132, Rev A, dated 8/8/02.  The GSUs for this phase of the development will be provided as GFE and will be form-fit-modified function sensors that perform like the final configuration unit under development by ParthusCeva.  This sensor is under development by the JAMI program and is due for final delivery in August 03.  The deliverable under Phase 1 shall be three complete form-fit-function JTU units.  The first phase of this development will be awarded to minimize schedule risk since the final GSU configuration is not yet available.  The second phase of this development effort will be to integrate the final GSU configuration into the design and perform qualification testing on the final JTU configuration.  The government will not exercise this option until such time that the GSU is qualified, tested and validated that it meets the requirements of the high dynamic GSU specification, NAWC CH-3125 rev C, dated 8/15/02.  Performance information on the ParthusCeva products will be made available by the government on request.  Use of these components is recommended; however, the contractor may propose other GPS technology that meets the requirements of NAWC-3125, if desired.  Note that the ParthusCeva GSU requires a ground processor that is available from ParthusCeva.  Under contract with Integrity Systems Inc., the government has also developed accumulation algorithms to process the IMU data and accumulate the data to a high degree of accuracy.  The government proposes to make these algorithms available under license to the JTU designer if requested.  These algorithms and associated implementation code are ITAR controlled; therefore, the JTU contractor must obtain ITAR approval prior to contract award.  The government will obtain GSU ground processing units under a separate contract for government testing, but the JTU contractor is responsible for acquiring from ParthusCeva any GSUs required for completion of Phase 2 of this contract.  Pre-delivery testing shall be conducted by the contractor; however, GSU testing may be supported by government simulation testing facilities.  The government shall also support JTU Final Acceptance Testing in accordance with a Test Plan to be developed by the contractor and approved by the government.  Contract award will be based on a Commercial Item (FAR Part 12, and 13.5) Best Value, firm fixed price contract for Phase 1 as described above with an 8 month period of performance.  Phase 2 of the project will be awarded as Time and Material not-to-exceed optional CLINs, including qualification testing, limited production, full production, and JTU contractor support for the initial integration of the JTU into the AMRAAM telemetry system.  The required period of performance for Phase 2 could extend through 12/05 if all contemplated optional CLINs are exercised.  To satisfy other JAMI schedule requirements, qualification of final JTU configuration must be accomplished by 5/04, with limited production units (up to 5) of the final configuration made available by 7/04.  Formal solicitation for this development program will follow in two weeks, along with the applicable SOW.  Contract award is anticipated no later than early April.

<DESC>CH2M Hill Hanford Group (CH2M HILL), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy River Protection Project, is soliciting interest and information from firms having the capability to perform pressure and external load tests on the 3 inch PUREX connector used at Hanford Site tank waste transfer systems (see attached sketch).  The connector consists of a block (in a form of a 900 elbow) welded on one side to 3-inch jumper piping and is connected on the other side to the flange of a 3-inch nozzle (which is not an integral part of the connector assembly) by means of three hooks placed at 1200 apart.  An operating screw to tighten the hooks with a nut to hold the three hooks, and a skirt to guide the hooks and also to hold the gasket retainer ring and prevents the block from moving laterally. The requirement is to qualify the PUREX connector for 400 psig at 200?F with external loads in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME B31.3, Process Piping, Code.  It is also required to determine the maximum pressure rated capacity of the connector at temperature with associated external loads in accordance with ASME B31.3.   

The technical approach described in this test program (see attached file) is CH2M HILL?s current concept of how this program should proceed.  However, we welcome alternative approaches and we solicit your ideas to accelerate and/or improve the process of implementing the test program.

The 96th MG?s requirement is that all transcription will be completed, as specified  in the SOW and available for review and use by 96th MG Providers.   The contractor shall transcribe directly into an automated information system and  ensure the finished product is available for 96th MG provider review and use in a format prescribed  or agreed to by the 96th MG.  .

Radiology transcription is a shared service between 96th MG civil service employees and contract personnel with the 96th mg providing two transcriptionists and the  Contractor providing one or more employees as needed to meet workload demands.   The workload during FY 03 is estimated to increase to 415,000 lines per month and radiology to 33,333 lines per month due to the increase in medical staff requirements as approximately 180 providers and 5 radiologists will be dictating.    The period of performance is one base year estimated from 1 Mar 03 through 31 Apr 04 with 4 one-year option years subject to availability of funds.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to award a sole source contract to Boeing Phantom Works of Seattle, Washington to procure support services in the field of mathematical libraries to support geometry and engineering requirements for the integration of modeling and simulation tools; including software development, algorithm development, training, testing, and documentation.  The integration of modeling and simulation tools into the ship design process is being performed by NSWCCD's LEAPS software.  This software is based on GEML and requires the functionality and interface afforded by using the GEML library and its n-dimensional mathematical NURBS representations, which includes both the range and domain variables.  Boeing Phantom Works is the sole pioneer in this multi-dimensional capability and has been the author of both GEML and DT_NURBS (GE ML's predecessor) since 1989.  Specific technical expertise is required in the areas of intersection, evaluation, interpolation, exchange standards, and algorithmic representations of physical behaviors models.  The computer programming expertise includes C++, object modeling, Rational Rose, UNIX, and Windows NT/2000/XP.  Software developed must be compatible with NSWCCD's programming style guidelines.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a five-year Indefinite Delivery /Indefinite Quantity Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract, obtained on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), based on only one responsible source.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The objective of this contract is to provide the ability to obtain multiple slices of animals and specimens in multiple orientations (axial, coronal, sagittal, oblique) together with the unique soft tissue contrast provided by MRI that will enhance and allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of study material, will provide a guide to the pathologist regarding important sites for conventional pathology sampling, and will allow for mapping and characterization of structures (e.g., vascular architecture, volumetric reconstruction and measurement of brain structures) not easily done by conventional techniques.  This provides a unique contribution to enhance our scientific capability and is, thus, an important advancement and contribution to the scientific community.  The in vivo imaging capability will allow following the temporal pathogenesis and recovery from disease processes in the same animal, thereby providing information not otherwise available.  Potential application of findings and techniques directly to human clinical medicine and pathology is anticipated. 

All studies performed under this contract that involve the processing of pathology specimens and the generation and/or interpretation of pathology and imaging data shall be conducted and documented following procedures that provide for the independent reconstruction of the work performed.  The specimens and records resulting from these studies will be incorporated by NIEHS into the archival records for the respective studies and must be compatible with the NTP database (e.g., Oracle) currently in use.  
 This contract will cover a five year period with one award and will provide for one yearly option.  The estimated level of effort is 3,424 labor hours for the base contract and 768 labor hour for the yearly option.  All requests must reference RFP No. 03-02 and must be directed to the office listed above.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Ms. Yang Jienan, International Activities Division, Tianjin Environmental Protection Bureau, 17 Fukang Lu, Tianjin, CHINA 300191, Phone: 86-22-2305-1522, Fax: 86-22-2366-8231  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study that will identify for the Tianjin Environmental Protection Bureau the procedures and equipment needed to establish a medical waste collection, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal system; a civilian radioactive waste management, monitoring, and disposal system; and an environmental emergency response system.

Tianjin is located in the northeast of China, about 120 kilometers from Beijing.  It is the largest deepwater port in northern China and serves as Beijing?s primary seaport.  With a population of 10 million, it is one of the larger cities in China.  The municipality is a center for the industry, trade, business, and transportation of the entire northeast region.  As industrialization accelerates in the area, increased environmental degradation has resulted in a focus on ways to mitigate these effects.

The project proposed involves a study on three related projects: a medical waste collection, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal system; a civilian radioactive waste management, monitoring, and disposal system; and an environmental emergency response system.  Annually, Tianjin generates approximately 7,500 tons of medical waste, which is currently disposed of without safe or effective treatment.  Recent legislation and regulations have mandated that by 2004, 100% of medical waste should be safely treated and disposed.  To meet this goal, the Municipality plans to establish a medical waste management, treatment, and disposal system to manage the waste generated by hospitals, clinics, and research institutions to prevent infection and reduce pollution.

In 1992, Tianjin constructed a facility to store radioactive waste from the various civilian nuclear applications of the city (i.e. research, teaching, medical treatment).  By 2000, over 1,200 tubs of solid radioactive waste, 1.8 tons of liquid radioactive waste, and 339 released radiation sources had been recovered and stored.  Because the civilian radioactive storage facility in Beijing is full, Tianjin has been storing the excess radioactive waste of the capital since 1999.  To remedy this situation, the Tianjin Municipal Government has approved the second phase expansion of the civilian radioactive waste storage facility.  Once this expansion is completed, the facility will have the capability to store civilian radioactive waste for the next 30 years.  The State Environmental Protection Administration has endorsed the project and approved of Tianjin as a pilot site for the registration program of radioactive waste and to develop/standardize the management system of civilian radioactive waste.  The study will recommend an applicable management system, storage and disposal alternatives, and the design of a functional lab system for the civilian radioactive waste management, monitoring, and storage system.

Tianjin also plans to establish a chemical/hazardous material related emergency response system.  The increased industrialization of the Municipality has resulted in the development of the chemical, petroleum, pharmaceutical, printing, dying, and metallurgical industries.  Each of these sectors utilizes materials that could have potential disastrous effects on the environment.  The Tianjin Municipal Government has proposed to establish an emergency management, communication and response system, an emergency monitoring system, and an emergency response action plan.  The feasibility study would assist Tianjin on the management structure development and recommend applicable systems for implementation.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $223,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, local time, February 21, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The project sponsor, SIGET, is the government agency of El Salvador responsible for the regulation of the electricity and telecoms sectors.  Originally created in September, 1996, it is responsible for implementing and applying both national official policy and international treaty obligations in these sectors.

SIGET believes that its most pressing need is a comprehensive review of the interconnection issues, with the aim of remedying a number of shortcomings that are currently hampering the development of a more open and competitive marketplace.  The review would include technical, legal/regulatory, economic and administrative aspects of interconnection regulation and policy, as well as a survey and analysis of interconnection agreements that are already in place or are pending.  Although not originally cited by SIGET, the review should also cover the issue of Local Loop Unbundling (LLU), which was not treated in any detail in the existing statutes.  The review should lead to the preparation of draft legal instruments, as well as practical recommendations for their implementation.  Finally, the review should extend to certain aspects of anticompetitive and consumer protection regulation.

 The terms of reference for the Technical Assistance would include the following tasks: 

1)	General Survey of Legal/Regulatory Interconnection Climate, 
a.	Survey of Formal Regulatory Regime
b.	Survey of Interconnection Regime
2)	Review of Interconnection Issues both Fixed and Mobile Environments
a.	Review of Technical Interconnection Issues
b.	Review of Administrative Interconnection Issues
c.	Review of Interconnection Pricing/Costing Issues
d.	Review of Impact of IP Telephony on Interconnection Related Issues
e.	Development of Feasible Options and Preferred Alternatives

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation number 7TF-03-0002 Request for Proposal.

Questions received regarding this request for proposals, and answers, are listed below.  Also, please note change in past performance evaluation regarding submittal of references.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

1) Actual Antennas to be mounted (model/quantity/elevation)
A: Taco Antennas of various models.  Require 6 position platform and the towers are to be of various heights depending on the locations.  However, they must meet specifications to be lower than the platform level of the radar tower.  And, they must be of standard type to match other towers already in the USAF/1St Air Force for maintenance and logistics control.
2) Lighting requirements.  A:  No lighting requirements but convenience outlets at bottom and platform level
3) Horizontal waveguide supports?  A: None required.  Vertical supports for RF/Heilax cable
4) Paint? A: No.  Tower to be Galvanized
5) Wind speed towers are to be designed for.  A:  Varies with area but would estimate winds up to 100 MPH
6) Is ice to be considered in tower design?  A:  1/2 to 3/4 inch
7) How many coax runs shall each tower support?  A:  Up to 8 each 7/8-in. 
8)  Does the Government require any unusual non-commercial inspection or assembly process documentation to be supplied with these structures?  A:  No
9) Does the supplied tower need only to meet requirements of the current EIA/TIA-222F recommendations?  A:  Yes
10) Are assembled pre-welded tower sections or antenna platform components with mounting flanges acceptable?  A:  Yes, assuming this is the tower only.  The mounts for the antennas must be "swing out" type to meet the common spacing of antennas.
11) After fabrication, is the delivered tower to be painted, hot dip galvanized, or a combination?  A:  Hot Dip galvanized
12) What needs to be supplied for tower grounding?  A:  Tower grounding will be provided by the erection contractor. 
13) In addition to providing these towers, are foundation designs required as well as a deliverable item?  Yes.    
14) If foundation designs are required, is the government looking for a generic design based on normal soil or a custom design based on a Government supplied furnished soils report?  A:  Foundation/piers that come with towers from the vendor will be used and augmented with known tower design information in the area of the project.  Normally, information is available from FAA.  And, there are referenced standards for different areas/soil condition.
15) Please specify when the foundation design if required is due as a deliverable.  A:  Within a month after contract award or with the towers.
16) Is the Government looking for these structures to be installed by the supplier within scope of this solicitation?  A:  No.
17) Would the government accept as an optional line item a coast for installation?  A:  No.
18) How many copies of tower drawings need to be supplied with the towers?  A:  Two
19) Are sealed drawings (stamped via PE licensed in the proposed State of Construction) required as a deliverable item.  A:  If towers are designed and built to normal industry standards, sealed drawings are not required.    
20) Can specific model, make of antennas be provided; need to know RF Transmission line used for each antenna.  A:  See answer in paragraph 1 above.  UHF/VHF antennas made by Taco will be used.
21) Is a microwave cable ladder need to be designed with additional expansion capability for future requirements? If yes, please furnish expansion requirements.  A:  This question was asked above.  Answer is no.
22) Is platform description an area with a minimum of 42 sq. feet of overall footprint surface area, or a platform where there is a minimum 42 sq.feet of overall materials?  A:  Platforms are normally described as the surface area, i.e., 6-ft by 8-ft with railings at a height of app 42-in to 48-inches.  Platforms are designed to permit spacing for antennas and to minimize cross talk RF interference when the antennas are operational.  Space for antenna separation is 8-ft.
23) Would Government consider in lieu of a square or rectangular platform, a hex (6) sided or Triangular shaped (Delta) platform design with the required 8 foot antenna mounting pipe separation?  A:  Might be considered, but would have to review any drawings.
24) What is the maximum diameter of the antenna mounting pipes on antenna platform?  A:  Normally 2-1/2 inch (IPS)(2.875 inch OD).
25) Is the antenna platform to be attached to the top, above the 70 ft of the supplied tower? Confirm that the safety-climbing device can be installed within the perimeter of the self supporting surface face.  A:  Platform is to be at the top of the tower and requires a vendor that has different overall height plans to meet mission requirements.  This means for example some towers are needed that have an overall height of 34-ft, i.e., the basic tower is 30-ft with a nominal height of the top rail on the platform of 4-ft.  And, some might require an overall height of say 30-ft, i.e., the basic tower is 26-ft with a nominal height of the top rail being 4-ft making an overall height of 30-ft. 
26) What is the maximum allowerd overall height of this structure including the antenna platform?  A:  70 feet.
27) Is a drawing available for presentation and clarification purposes?  A: No.
28) Would government consider a design where the antenna platform is attached to the vertical leg member if the supplied 70 foot tower with catwalk grating surrounding the exterior of the antenna platform outside of the tower face only?  A:  Hard to read/understand the question but the answer is NO, if the question is understood.  And, remember that a safety climb is required with the towers. 
29) Will antennas be installed in same plane and polarity?  A:  Yes and that is the reason "swing-out antenna mounting arms" are used.
30) What type antennas are being installed-manufacturer, weight, etc?  A:  Again, same question as twice before.  Taco UHF/VHF antennas are being used.  D4062A and D4061A1 are being used for the most part.
31) Is there a drawing of the desired final platform construction?  A:  No, but normally review potential vendor drawings and to mount 6 antennas with proper spacing, the platform size is 6-ft by 8-ft (+/-).
32) Is there a minimum or maximum tower base cross section size? Top cap cross-section size?  A:  No
33) Is there a wind loading spec for operational and survivability of the antennae?  A:  Yes, and it is basically the same for most antennas of like ability.  That is weight of 13.5 to 19.5 lbs, wind loading of 85 kt with 1/2 inch radial ice and on some antennas, it is 105 kt with 1/2 inch radial ice.
34) Does proposal require installation and construction on site by the tower supplier?  A: No.   
35) What is the weight and windload of the six antennas at Jedburg site?  A: Using 6 ea D4062A UHF Antennas, the combined weight would be 84 lbs (14 lbs ea).  These antennas can take 105 kt wind loading with 1/2 inch radial ice.  
36) Is the Jedburg site in a highly lightning prone area?  A:  No
37) What is the size of RF transmission lines used for each antenna?  A:  Max size will be 7/8 inch Andrews or equal Heliax cable.
38) Is microwave cable ladder to be supplied with these towers?  Microwave isn?t being used and normally, microwave uses waveguide.  However, the ladder used is normally the same and it can be supplied with the tower however, it normally cost more.  If it doesn't come with the towers, then the erection contractor will supply it.  What is max number of transmission lines required?  There will be 7 each 7/8 inch Andrews Heliax cable run to each tower platform.
39) What would be minimum rung spacing of these towers?  A:  12 inch
40) Is transmission line Ice-Bridge to be supplied with towers? Length and width?  A:  No
41) Who is the contact person for this job? A:  Bill Lively, GSA/FTS/7T-5, 819 Taylor Street, Room 14A02, Ft. Worth, TX 76102.  Phone 817-978-4086, Fax 817-978-4739, email address bill.lively@gsa.gov
42) Estimated overall cost of the project?  A: Range of $50,000.00 to $100,000.00.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to cancel the subject solicitation in its entirety.

We wish to provide the following information to all potential bidders:

We have received requests for technical information and data developed under contracts for previous phases of this work. Following issuance of the solicitation, we determined that the subject requirement is a continuation of work begun under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.  15 USC ? 638(j)(2)(A) provides for retention of rights and data generated in the performance a contract by a small business concern under the SIBR program.  The contract under which the data was developed contained a Rights and Data clause which provides that "Rights in technical data, including software developed under any contract resulting from this solicitation, shall remain with the contractor except that the Government shall have the limited right to use such data for Government purposes and shall not release such data outside the Government without permission of the contractor for a period of four years from completion of the project from which the data were generated. . . ."  In view of the aforementioned, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is precluded from releasing the requested technical information and data without the permission of Physical Acoustics Corporation.  Physical Acoustics has exercised its right to withhold the data developed under the SIBR program.

It is now FRA's intention to forward the requirement to the John A.Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, MA, which handled the previous work under the SBIR program.

Many of the moves will include office furniture, equipment, modular furniture, files, medical and clinical materials, sophisticated computer systems, filing systems and typical office contents.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract or cooperative agreement.   However, potential sources that may be interested in a forestry program in Bolivia are requested to mail, fax, or email their interest and information regarding their capabilities and experience to the contact address (listed below) by January 22, 2003.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) plans to support a new program to improve tropical forest management in Bolivia. Since 1996, Bolivia has made important advances toward the goal of sustainable management of its tropical forests and biological diversity. USAID/Bolivia has supported these advances through programs of policy development, technical assistance, training and research.  As a result of the partnership between USAID, the Government of Bolivia, the private sector, and social groups, Bolivia currently leads the world in tropical forests which have been independently certified as well managed.  

Bolivians are rightfully proud of these achievements, and they are determined to continue Bolivia's leadership in sustainable tropical forest management. However, significant constraints are currently hindering further progress. These include:

(1)	A land and forest policy framework that may provide stronger incentives for deforestation than for sustainable forest management, biodiversity conservation, and forest fire prevention; 

(2)	Generally weak forestry institutions, whether they be governmental or non-governmental;  

(3)	Insufficient information on forest ecology, silviculture, and forest product development;  
(4)	A wood products industry in which many companies are inefficient, under-capitalized, and struggling to survive; and,
 
(5)	Generally low levels of awareness and appreciation, by key Bolivian stakeholders, of the importance of forest management to Bolivia's development.

USAID/Bolivia plans to assist the Government of Bolivia (GOB), community groups, private sector, and other stakeholders to address some of these (and potentially other) constraints.   Institutions, contractors, for profit and non profit organizations that may be interested in participating in this forestry program are requested to contact USAID/Bolivia.  Interested institutions must be able to achieve results in some or all of the following thematic areas:

(1)	Policy analysis.  Bolivia's new forestry regime has resulted in important improvements in forest management.  However, further applied analyses may be needed;

(2)	Institutional Strengthening.  While key forest management institutions have become much more effective, some may require additional assistance;  


(3)	Applied research.  Further applied research, ranging from forest ecology to product development, may be needed to ensure that forest management is sustainable; 
 
(4)	Technical assistance in tropical forest management.  Two groups in particular may require technical assistance:  (a) indigenous and non-indigenous community organizations which are responsible for large expanses of Bolivian forests, and (b) forestry companies, whether community-based or not, which need to improve their industrial operations and efficiency;
(5)	Education and training.  The needs are potentially diverse, ranging from a lack of enough highly qualify forestry professionals to insufficient education materials; 
 
(6)	Communication.  Recent surveys supported by USAID demonstrate that public awareness and positive behaviors regarding forest management are limited.  Effective communication activities may be needed.

To request copies of relevant background studies financed by USAID/Bolivia please contact the Regional Contracting Office. For US Mail contact: Phillip S. Tresch, Regional Contracting Officer, USAID/Bolivia, Unit # 3914, APO AA 34032; Email: ptresch@usaid.gov

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT:  General Services Administration (GSA) intends to negotiate a sole source Task Order with EDS.  The Contractor shall provide mainframe computing platform resources, services, and support for Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) 1.0 processing and components of DEERS 2.x.  At the same location the Contractor shall provide system administration support and other services for the DEERS 2.x UNIX based processing.  The DEERS 2.x UNIX processing is performed on Government-furnished equipment (GFE) computing platforms; the Contractor shall be responsible for the environment and access to the environment.  

DEERS 1.0 (or the legacy system) processes on an HDS F7C/68S mainframe computer with connections to the UNIX processing environment consisting of a Sun ES10000 and 2 Sun E6500 processors.  The DEERS 1.0 environment is a Customer Information Control System (CICS)-based interactive system processing over 16,000,000 interactive transactions per month.  The primary business function of the DEERS 1.0 is to provide eligibility inquiry information from the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractors (MCSCs).  DEERS 1.0 receives eligibility update information from the DEERS 2.x system via a process known as New to Old (N2O).  Since the timing of the eligibility information is critical to accurate eligibility inquiries, the N2O process runs over 40,000 times per month. One of the most complex components of the legacy system is the network and communications infrastructure.  Attachment B, contains Figure 1, DMDC/DEERS wide area network (WAN) Infrastructure which provides a schematic diagram of the network configuration. 

Over the next 18 months, DMDC expects the DEERS 1.0 processing to be reduced as a result of new system components and the migration of the legacy processing to the UNIX environment. Work is also underway to reduce the data storage requirements for DEERS 1.0.  The complete migration for DEERS 1.0 is dependent on the contractual arrangements with the MCSCs and associated award of the new TRICARE Next Generation contracts by the TRICARE Management Agency.  Complete migration is expected to occur by December 2003.

DEERS 2.x components also utilize the mainframe-processing environment at Auburn Hills Service Management Center (AHSMC) in Auburn Hills, Michigan.  Over 1,000,000 DEERS 2.x online transactions per month are received by the mainframe CICS environment.  These transactions are then "switched" to the UNIX processing environment for processing.  In addition to the online transactions, the mainframe environment provides security processing for all DEERS 1.0 and 2.x users. Over 12,000 DEERS users are present in the mainframe security system. This section describes the current configuration of the mainframe, UNIX systems, and networks located at AHSMC. 

Resource consumption for the mainframe components of DEERS 1.0 and DEERS 2.x include approximately 300 million instructions per second, 8000 magnetic tapes, and over 3800 gigabytes per day in disk storage.  The AHSMC provides these resources as a part of the services contracted for. 

UNIX system administration services are provided for the DMDC production computing platforms at Contractor?s site.  The UNIX processing environment consists of GFE equipment and GFE software.  The Contractor's personnel provide floor space in the AHSMC and perform system administration services, tape processing, comprehensive monitoring and other service related functions for DMDC in support of their UNIX environment.  As stated previously, the DEERS 1.0 and DEERS 2.x mainframe components are tightly integrated with the DEERS 2.x UNIX processing and separation would be almost impossible from a service and performance perspective.  Like the mainframe environment, the most complex component of the UNIX environment at AHSMC is the network.  The AHSMC DMDC Network is located at AHSMC with connections to other locations.

DEERS 2.x UNIX processing consists of over 2,500,000 RAPIDS CAC interactive transitions and over 50,000 batch jobs per month.  The online transactions do not flow through the "switcher" mainframe environment. "Switcher" and non-"switcher" transaction volumes for a month would be over 3,500,000 transactions processed in the UNIX environment. Data flow interfaces between the mainframe and UNIX systems at AHSMC.

The NAICS Code is 518210.  This task order will be awarded to EDS unless other Offerors provide a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement.  Capability statement shall include evidence that firm has previous experience providing mainframe computing platform resources, services, and support for Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) 1.0 (legacy system) processing and components of DEERS 2.x.  In addition previous experience must include providing system administration support and other services for the DEERS 2.x UNIX-based processing. on Government-furnished equipment (GFE) computing platforms.  The Offeror must also provide experience references for the transition of the  computing platform environments from a contractor facility to the Offeror's facility.  This transition must be accomplished with no more than 16 hours of disruption of service to the DMDC user community.  The Offeror shall also provide a fall-back capability and contingency plans for the transition.  All transition plans work will be approved by DMDC and operational performance will be approved by DMDC.  The Offeror must provide some independent evidence for the quality of its proposed operational environment such as ISO 9001 certification or equivalent evidence of quality operations.  The Offeror must provide at least 2 similar projects that their firm has worked on which are similar in scope and their outcome and at least one customer reference Point Of Contact (POC) with telephone number for the proposed projects.  Please provide the statement via e-mail to Sharon.Hunter@GSA.Gov and cc Sandra.Haynes@GSA.Gov by Close Of Business (COB) January 15, 2003, Local Pacific Time.  This notice is not a solicitation, nor is it a formal Request for Proposal.  Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In the absence of responses from firms that believe they have the capability to provide these services, GSA intends to negotiate with EDS, located at 13600 EDS Drive, Herndon, Virginia 20171.

The required services will start on or about March 15, 2003.  Numbered Note: 22.

<DESC>Training Transformation, mandated OSD, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DoD?s new ?system of systems? environment.  As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes.  Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process.  Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter?or a similar forcing function construct?to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing.  Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of ?key performance parameters? throughout the acquisition process.  

NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for development and revision of guiding documents and training support in their use to inform DoD training system acquisition managers and developers in the improvement of acquisition process and training system effectiveness to meet the strategic OSD goal cited above.

The products will include analysis of education and training technology and processes,  incorporation of human performance factors across the processes, insertion of technology, and streamlining of the Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process.  The effort will include the development of training system acquisition and development guidance products that include DoD training Military Standards, Specifications, and Handbooks, electronic performance support systems, and other aids for training managers and developers.  This effort will also include market research of best ISD business practices related to the ISD/SAT, interactive multimedia instruction, advanced distributed learning, distributed mission training, and trainer acquisition processes.  It will include independent verification and validation of computer-based training and education courses and products, analysis of industry training processes and potential application for DoD training and education.  It will also include guidance for identification of required human performance measures and opportunities for embedded training early in the acquisition process. 

The joint services ISD/SAT and training acquisition policies emerged out of long-term debates within the Defense Training System Working Group (DTSWG) to arrive at consensus on best practices. The Contractor must have been actively involved in that deliberative process to ensure a seamless transition to emerging acquisition and development initiatives. The Contractor must additionally have experience in the authoring and revision of the current guiding documents.  Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with MIL-PRF-29612, MIL-HDBK-29612, related DIDs, MIL-PRF-XXXX and MIL-HDBK-XXXX for trainers and job-aids for enhancing their usefulness.  In addition to the above the contractor must have knowledge of and experience in documenting process and products related to the following:

1)	Researching emerging training technology
2)	Applying innovative processes for evaluating these technologies for applicability for implementation across the Joint Services
3)	Synthesizing these processes into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements is essential. 
4)	Datamining
5)	Section 505 Compliance
6)	Measurement and evaluation of training effectiveness
7)	Weapons Systems and Training Systems Acquisition
8)	Systems Engineering
9)	Human Systems Integration
10)	Human Systems Engineering
11)	IMI/ADL SCORM production process
12)	Human Performance Analysis
13)	Training Requirements Front End Analysis
14)	Cost-benefit Analysis

<SUBJECT>Q -- Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Related Services
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SLC-0039
<CONTACT>Sheri Custer, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-402-3065, Fax 301-402-3407, Email custers@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of businesses to provide on-site Positron Emission Tomography (PET) related services. The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS 621512, Diagnostic Imaging Centers, with a size standard of $11.5 Million.  The Professional Services required shall include, but not be limited to, the following salient characteristics, specifications, and features: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) will be used as a major clinical research tool. PET is a nuclear medicine procedure that allows sequential imaging of the in-vivo distribution of an intravenously administered radiolabeled compound (radiotracer) that has been designed to report on the status of a particular biochemical or physiological parameter (e.g. neuroreceptor concentration, blood flow). Each radiotracer is labeled with a short-lived positron-emitter (e.g. carbon-11 or fluorine-18 with half-lives of 20 and 110 min, respectively).  Hence for each PET experiment the radiotracer has to be prepared anew.  Information about the extent of metabolism of the radiotracer in each PET experiment is often required to allow quantitative parameters to be derived from the acquired PET data according to biomathematical models. Experimentally, this entails rapid analyses of sequential blood samples. A primary aim of the Branch is the development of new radiotracers through research effort on medicinal chemistry and radiochemistry. To accomplish these goals, this Branch requires the time limited professional services of two persons:  a Radiochemist and a Research Nuclear Medicine Technologist.

RADIOCHEMISTRY SERVICES.  The services to be provided are:  1) regular syntheses of required radiotracers on automated equipment, 2) to perform regular analyses of blood samples from human subjects and animals, using for example HPLC and 3) synthetic organic chemistry and radiochemistry in support of new radiotracer development. The person capable of providing these services would have at least an MS degree in chemistry, at least two (2) years experience with synthetic organic chemistry, and offer two (2) years experience with radiochemistry.	

RESEARCH NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGIST SERVICES.  This Branch requires a high-level Nuclear Medicine/ PET technical specialist who is not only qualified to perform research PET imaging in humans and animals but also is capable to perform complex PET data analyses and independent technical research work. The overall purpose/objectives of the procurement of a PET technical specialist are to make research activities efficient and to enhance the quality of work in the imaging section of the Molecular Imaging Branch. The specific objectives of this recruitment are to 1) perform PET imaging and image data processing in humans and animals; 2) perform complex PET quantification data analysis; 3) solve PET related technical questions by designing and performing independent technical research work; and finally 4) integrate the technical staff with the core scientist group. Thus, this recruitment plays a dual role of PET technologist and technical researcher. The applicant should have a bachelor's degree, be a Certified Nuclear Medicine Technologist, have at least four years experience in nuclear medicine research, and a track record of research publications.

Concerns that respond to this synopsis shall furnish concise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above and are invited to submit capability statements in an Original Plus Two (2) Copies no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of this announcement. Information furnished should include enough material to allow the NIH to perform a proper evaluation.  The period of performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award with four (4) successive twelve (12) month option periods.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) NOR IS AN RFP CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  Capability Statements: (a)  If mailing your capabilities through the U.S. Postal Service use the following address:  National Institutes of Health, Office of Logistics and Acquisition Operations, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 529-Q, MSC 7663, ATTN: Sheri Custer, Bethesda, MD 20892.  (b) If hand delivering, or using a courier service such as: UPS, Federal Express, etc., use the following City, State, and Zip Code: Rockville, MD  20852.  Responses by Facsimile (FAX) will NOT be accepted.  This market survey is being conducted through the FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Vacuum Deposition of Powdered Phosphor on Optical Surfaces
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEE TO COMMERCIALIZE A PROCESS FOR THE VACUUM DEPOSITION OF POWDERED PHOSPHORS ON OPTICAL SURFACES


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology for the vacuum deposition of phosphors on optical surfaces for night vision devices.

Industry currently uses powdered phosphors deposited on optics for night vision devices.  LLNL has a new technology that decreases the cost, increases the reliability, and increases the yield of the process of depositing phosphors.  The new process uses vacuum deposition to deposit a very uniform and smooth phosphor layer on the optic surface.  A special annealing step in the process allows the phosphor surface to be directly coated with a thin layer of aluminum. Also, because the phosphor surface is very smooth, the layer of aluminum used to coat the phosphor is much thinner than those in current manufacturing processes. This thinner layer of aluminum reduces the so-called ?dead layer? voltage.  Because the phosphor screen is much smoother than conventional screens, much higher voltages can be applied to increase sensitivity, or the gap between the phosphor and the microchannel plate can be reduced while maintaining stable operation. The net result is higher performance from the night vision device.

In addition, the LLNL process does not require any use of lacquer between the phosphor and the aluminum, which eliminates some manufacturing steps currently used for fabricating night vision devices.  

LLNL?s process is very controllable and transforms the manufacturing of phosphor screens into more of a science and less of an art. The results are very uniform phosphor screens with reliable and reproducible results, which translate into better overall product yields and potentially reduced cost.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's technology for the vacuum deposition of phosphor on optical surfaces should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing the this technology.

 
Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO00004-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's technology for the vacuum deposition of phosphor on optical surfaces.
