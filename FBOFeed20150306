<DESC>This announcement serves two purposes:  1) This is a Notice of Contracting Action for an anticipated upcoming program and BAA announcement as summarized below; and 2) this is also a Sources Sought Notice for the purpose of conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet Air Force needs as identified below:
<p>The objective of this program will be to design, develop and demonstrate a relevant-scale tactical vehicle thermal management system which optimally manages transport of heat from dynamical heat loads to the available aircraft sinks of fuel and/or engine air during the course of pertinent mission sets.  The solicitation seeks integrated system-level solutions.  As such, component-specific solutions are not within the scope of this activity.  Further, technological risks necessary to achieve a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 demonstration must be identified and a suitable risk-mitigation plan provided which may include integrated testing with an adaptive-cycle turbine engine.  Longer term objectives may include integrated testing of the TRL 6 integrated system technology with an adaptive-cycle or surrogate engine to mitigate risks prior to vehicle EMD.</p>

<p>Contract Place of Performance: 1600 Clifton Road NE Atlanta, GA 30333</p>
<p><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). This acquisition is to purchase Bexsero&reg;  (rMenB+OMV NZ) vaccine for adults so that the vaccine can be used to vaccinate high risk individuals as recommended by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).   Meningococcal disease is a life-threatening illness caused by bacteria that can infect the bloodstream (sepsis) and the lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis. The bacteria are transmitted from person to person through respiratory or throat secretions (e.g., by coughing, kissing or sharing eating utensils). Based on CDC data for 2012, about 500 total cases of meningococcal disease were reported in the U.S., of which 160 were caused by serogroup B.  Meningococcal disease can be treated with antibiotics to reduce the risk of death or serious long-term problems, but even with immediate medical attention these outcomes are not always prevented. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent meningococcal disease.</p>
<p><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency for future procurement.

<p><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). This acquisition is to purchase Bexsero&reg;  (rMenB+OMV NZ) vaccine for adults so that the vaccine can be used to vaccinate high risk individuals as recommended by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).   Meningococcal disease is a life-threatening illness caused by bacteria that can infect the bloodstream (sepsis) and the lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis. The bacteria are transmitted from person to person through respiratory or throat secretions (e.g., by coughing, kissing or sharing eating utensils). Based on CDC data for 2012, about 500 total cases of meningococcal disease were reported in the U.S., of which 160 were caused by serogroup B.  Meningococcal disease can be treated with antibiotics to reduce the risk of death or serious long-term problems, but even with immediate medical attention these outcomes are not always prevented. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent meningococcal disease.</p>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address: US Forest Service, Region 10, 648 Mission St., Ketchikan AK 99901
<p>This is a pre-solicitation notice.</p>
<p>The Forest Service contemplates posting a solicitation for the CASCADE CREEK TRAIL IMPROVEMENT STEWARDSHIP PROJECT on or after March 21, 2015 with responses due on or after April 21, 2015. It is expected that a pre-proposal conference will be held. Details regarding the conference will be included in the RFP solicitation package.</p>
<p>Set Aside: The proposed procurement listed herein is unrestricted per Stewardship Authority.</p>
<p>The solicitation and any resultant contract is a stewardship project in accordance with Section 8205 of Public Law 113-79, the Agricultural Act of 2014. This grants the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management authority to enter into stewardship contracting projects with private persons or public or private entities, by contract or by agreement, to perform services to achieve land management goals for the national forests or public lands that meet local and rural community needs. Section 8205 supersedes the authority granted to the Forest Service in section 347. This acquisition has been tailored to fit the Government's method of trading goods for services.</p>
<p>Objectives for the project are generally, to define the area surrounding Thomas Bay on Petersburg Ranger District as a Stewardship Area, and specifically to minimize erosion and decrease resource damage in the Cascade Creek watershed (which drains into Thomas Bay) by improving trail conditions. This project will benefit local communities through the commercial contract offering and associated economic activity that will be generated. Long term benefits include improved trail condition to provide for improved recreational opportunities and an increase of the trail capacity, including for commercial guided services, without further degradation of the natural resources. The project is located in an area identified in the Tognass Land and Resource Management Plan (TLRMP) as having a Land Use Designation of Semi-remote Recreation and conforms to the Forest Plan direction stating activities in this LUD must "Provide for recreation and tourism in natural-appearing settings where opportunities for solitude and self-reliance are moderate to high".</p>
<p>This project consists of the reconstruction and re-routing of 0.5 miles of trail, reducing the current slope, and improving the tread to eliminate the amount of erosion that is occurring. Major work items are aggregate surfacing, stone riser steps, stone pitching, step stones, solid rock removal, rest areas, and demolition and replacement of the Cascade Creek bridge.</p>
<p>It is estimated that work will begin in July 2015 and be completed by July 2016. Actual start and end dates may be negotiated based upon actual award date, prospective work and weather conditions.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION DETAILS: <br />The following preliminary details are provided for the benefit of prospective offerors, but are subject to change in the actual solicitation.</p>
<p>Estimated price range: between $250,000 and $500,000</p>
<p>Contract type: firm-fixed-price.</p>
<p>Solicitation type: Request for Proposals.</p>

<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk Philadelphia Office intends to procure, for the Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), the continued maintenance and support of the Enterprise Safety Application Management System (ESAMS) on their Navy servers.  The ESAMS system is comprised of a unique suite of web-enabled applications that support and integrate safety and occupational health, traffic safety, recreational and off-duty safety, explosive safety, emergency management, fire and emergency services, anti-terrorism/force protection, security, and the chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive (CBRNE) program.  HGW and Associates has developed this fully integrated and powerful web based system of applications which has been implemented throughout CNIC, NAVFAC, and other tenant commands and organizations.
 ESAMS utilizes a centralized database that allows personnel, supervisors, department coordinators/administrators, command administrators, regional administrators, claimant administrators, program administrators and commands providing base operational support (BOS) administrators, a system to track information that supports compliance for their OSHA, NFPA, National Fire Administration (NFA), DoD, Navy requirements: i.e., training, metrics, inspections, respirator fit tests, and occupational medical surveillance, equipment tracking, voluntary protection program compliance (VPP), personnel requirements, etc.

This is a sole source action to be awarded to HGW and Associates LLC.  HGW is the only firm who can supply the required services for the acquisition.
  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract will be issued as a result.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based on the responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.
  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this notice.   Any responses to this synopsis should be sent to the attention of Mike Capilato (Code 260.2) at michael.capilato@navy.mil and reference this notice.  The applicable NAICS and size standard are 541511 and $27.5M respectively.

Past performance information provided by references, from Government records, or from other than the sources identified by the offeror may be used in the evaluation under any or all applicable evaluation factors.  In addition to the foregoing, PIPRS.gov will be used as a source of past performance information in the source selection process, in addition to any other past performance information required under this solicitation.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a requirement to perform post-production modifications (missionization) on newly delivered C-130J aircraft. The Missionization effort involves nose-to-tail modifications to the aircraft to incorporate the next-generation Minotaur Mission System Suite (MSS+) as well as the radar, sensors, and remaining C4ISR equipment that will enable aircrew to gather and process surveillance information for transmission to other shore and surface operators. <br /><br />Additionally, existing HC-130J aircraft (already missionized) must undergo modifications to be retrofitted with the MSS+ solution. These aircraft currently contain a legacy Mission System Suite (MSS) that is no longer procurable in its current configuration and has become economically unsupportable due to diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS) and material obsolescence. Removing the legacy MSS and incorporating the MSS+ on these aircraft will significantly mitigate the effects of both hardware and software obsolescence, plus offer an increase in Mission System performance over the legacy MSS. <br /><br />USCG plans to issue one competitive solicitation through FedBizOpps by the end of this calendar year 2014.

An operational need exists to provide the Soldier a personal protective system that allows the user to tailor his/her loads for mission-specific operations, thereby increasing survivability and mobility. The goal of SPS TEP is to provide the Soldiers with modular and scalable/mission-tailorable protection to reduce weight and increase mobility while optimizing protection. Currently the Army is in the final development stage that will down select between four (4) designs to go into Low Rate Initial Production/Full Rate Production (LRIP/FRP).  The Government design consists of four (4) components, the torso vest, the ballistic combat shirt, the load distribution system, and the pelvic protection system. If the Government design, one of the four designs, is selected then the Government will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the torso vest to go into LRIP/FRP.  <br>  <br> This RFI is to gather information specific to producing the torso vest component for the Government design if it is selected for LRIP/FRP.

These panels can then be inserted into a tactical outer carrier that also accommodates hard armor protective inserts.  The tactical outer carrier also contains two side plate pocket that will accommodate soft armor inserts.  The outer carrier is made of a flame resistant outer cloth, webbings, hook/loop, polyethylene stiffener, a quad-release system, and several other non-ballistic materials.  The torso vest comes in five (5) sizes, with the same sizing structure as the current front and back hard armor inserts.  Detailed patterns for the tactical outer carrier and the soft armor panels will be provided with any potential RFP. <br>  <br> Submission Information:  All interested vendors shall respond to the RFI by submitting the below information by close of business (COB) 20 March 2015: <br>  <br> -	Technical supporting information such as test reports or past research and development efforts investigating material performance and a soft armor ballistic design that meets or exceeds the TSN requirements. <br>  <br> -	Detailed description of any past performance related to the production of tactical vests and soft armor ballistic inserts. <br>  <br> -	Business name, address, business size and point of contact information (name, email and phone number). <br>  <br> -	Business name, address, business size of all sub-vendors. <br>  <br> -	Proprietary information should be clearly marked and will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. <br>  <br> Interested sources should submit the requested information not later than 20 March 2015 VIA EMAIL ONLY to lisa.j.yamakawa.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br> This information should be provided to the contracting office at US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, ATTN: Lisa Yamakawa, Contract Specialist, Team Tyree, by email at lisa.j.yamakawa.civ@mail.mil.

Program considerations include use of the Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC), incentives tied directly to the use of the GTCC for dining at preferred establishments and reward programs for frequent diners. The goal of the managed dining program is to provide a seamless solution to generate savings while offering convenience, choice, and satisfaction for travelers who currently frequent approximately 71 chains and individual establishments for meals during the course of their travel.<br />SUBMISSION INFORMATION:</p>

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing one custom solvent bench dedicated to manual resist spin-coating process to support nanofabrication in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST), NIST's nanotechnology user facility. The bench will be sited and used as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies in the CNST NanoFab. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the custom solvent bench that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>A resist spin-coating solvent bench is an exhausted enclosure that contains two bench-mounted spinners, four high precision hotplates and a well-illuminated, unobstructed horizontal work surface in the center where researchers can safely use various types of solvent solutions. The horizontal work surface and vertical wall space are typically equipped with accessories specialized for solvent processing. For NIST, the applications are nanofabrication processes. The work surface is a liquid-tight basin that collects all liquids from solvent handling in the work surface. The construction material is typically solvent-resistant stainless, with all facility supplies plumbing rated for use with various kinds of solvent, high purity nitrogen, vacuum and air.</p>
<p>NIST currently owns a couple of solvent benches that are nearing end-of-life and each of them has an out of dated, bulky bench-top resist spin coater sitting on, which creates a congested and cumbersome environment for manual resist processing. Configurations in both solvent benches can no longer meet the capacity requirements. In order to increase NIST's capacity to serve users and provide additional technical capabilities for nanofabrication, NIST has a need for a dedicated resist spin coating solvent bench.</p>
<p>1. GENERAL: Vendors will demonstrate their capability to design and build the following situations: <br />a. The resist spin coating bench is intended to be used by researchers who need to safely perform manual resist spin coating and cleaning using various types of solvent-based chemicals. <br />b. The bench is suitable for installation and use in a vertical laminar flow, class 100 cleanroom.<br />c. Demonstrate the ability to accommodate 3 or more simultaneous users. <br />d. The bench will be installed in a pre-defined location and therefore vendors need to demonstrate their ability to custom design for existing space and utilities. Provide examples of custom designs, including dimensions.<br />e. Provide samples or state benches are equipped and support the following utilities such as but not limited to: <br />i. high purity nitrogen, <br />ii. compressed air, <br />iii. vacuum, and <br />iv. 110 VAC GFCI electrical outlets.</p>
<p>2. BENCH CAPABILITIES<br />a. CO2 and/or other fire suppression systems.<br />b. Construction with solvent resistance stainless materials. <br />c. Capable of having wall mounted shelf (shelves).<br />d. Capable of having cup drains for liquid and solid solvent waste separately. <br />e. The ability to have storage space for several gallon-size bottles below the bench. <br />f. The final bench design will have the ability to incorporate 2 work positions for resist spin coating and one clear working space for manual solvent processing.<br />g. Each work position for resist spin coating ability to be equipped with:<br />(1) A minimum of 2 high precision hotplates in a stack and at least one supports proximity bake.<br />(2) One spin coater with the following capabilities: <br />(a) Supports spin speeds under substrate load condition, provide rpm ranges.<br />(b) Utilize removable bowl liners to facilitate cleaning. <br />(c) Ability to store more than 10 recipes and multi-steps recipes. <br />(3) One set of spin coater chucks capability to support various sample sizes, provide the mm range for wafers.<br />(4) Provide the range for Wafer centering devices.<br />(5) Ability to incorporate a high purity nitrogen spray gun.<br />b. Provide the capability for work space to include solvent processing, including the ability for a draining system for liquid solvent waste with quick-release connector to carboy for the convenience of waste collection.</p>
<p>3. SAFETY: Provide capability statements that final products have the ability to meet all safety standards set forth in the Semi S2-0709 standard.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.</p>
<p>Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture resist spin coating solvent benches are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to HARRY.BRUBAKER@NIST.GOV no later than MONDAY MARCH 23, 2015 by 4:00PM EST for this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: <br />1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. <br />2.

<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE. THIS RFI IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR ANY ACTUAL PROCUREMENT OF MATERIALS, MACHINERY, OR SERVICES. This notice does not constitute a solicitation or a promise of a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI are solely at the responding parties' expense. Respondents are solely responsible for properly marking and clearly identifying any proprietary information or trade secrets contained within their response. The Government will not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly marked and clearly identified. Proprietary information received in response to this RFI will be safeguarded and handled in accordance with applicable Government regulations. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued. Specific responses to the approaches will not disqualify or have an impact on participation and evaluation on future solicitations.</p>
<p>The NAVSEA Program Executive Office (PEO) Submarines (SUB), Undersea Warfare Systems Program Office (PMS 415) has been tasked to develop a surface ship anti-torpedo hard-kill capability for High Value Unit platforms (Carriers and Combat Logistics Force ships). This capability will be developed through two separate but associated programs: the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) and the Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT). The TWS will serve as a standalone detection, alert and tactical control system, and will provide the detection capability necessary for the ship to evade, decoy, or defeat the torpedo using existing or future tactics and countermeasures in addition to the CAT. The CAT will be developed separately as a hard-kill countermeasure. TWS and CAT are associated but independent acquisition programs, each with its own defined mission. The CAT will continue development as a common counter-measure for all platforms.</p>
<p>The CAT is a high performance system, including a self-propelled underwater vehicle that contains complex electronic and mechanical subassembly systems for providing propulsion, steering, navigation, and target detection. The system technologies include acoustic sonar, guidance and control electronics, electrical power, hydraulic systems, mechanical pumps, and propulsion. The manufacturing processes required to support production must achieve a high level of quality and reliability, and include the necessary environmental (temperature, shock, vibrations, underwater pressure, etc.) test capabilities and certified production test equipment. In addition, some Functional Item Replacement (FIR) and/or torpedo sections may require Highly Accelerated Stress Screen Testing in order to meet reliability requirements. Classified facilities for handling\storing hardware and documentation may be required.</p>
<p>The CAT consists of the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) and the All Up Round Equipment (AURE). The ATT is a small-diameter, quick-reaction hard-kill torpedo countermeasure used to disable incoming threat torpedoes. The ATT will search, home, terminal home, and fuse on its target using technology developed under sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research. It consists of the following 5 major sections: Nose, Warhead, Command &amp; Control, Powerplant and Tail. The ATT is housed in an AURE, which consists of a thin-walled composite canister, electrical cabling to enable communication between the ATT and fire control, and energetics for launching the ATT and the ATT canister.</p>
<p>PMS 415 issues this RFI to help determine the interest, technical capability, and qualifications of industry to meet the Government's needs to produce components of the CAT. PMS 415 is providing a Technical Data Package (TDP) associated with this RFI for informational purposes only. These UNCLASSIFIED documents will be made available via an Electronic Technical Information Center (ETIC).

<p class="Normal" style="margin: 0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Arial; font-size: medium;">The Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) plans to conduct a descriptive study of the Early Head Start program, titled Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Study &ndash; 2017 (Baby FACES 2017).</p>
<p class="Normal" style="margin: 0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Arial; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal" style="margin: 0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Arial; font-size: medium;">ACF initiated the Early Head Start program in response to the 1994 Head Start reauthorization, which established a special initiative for service delivery to families during pregnancy and with infants and toddlers. This comprehensive, two-generation program includes intensive services that can begin before the child is born and continue through the critical first three years with a focus on enhancing the child&rsquo;s development and supporting the family.</p>
<p class="Normal" style="margin: 0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Arial; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal" style="margin: 0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Arial; font-size: medium;">Since its inception, a robust body of research has accompanied the Early Head Start program. This includes an impact evaluation of some of the first grantees, research grant programs to spark innovation and answer policy and practice questions, and a survey of EHS programs to gather additional information on the management systems and services being provided as well as characteristics of children and families served. In 2007, the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) in ACF contracted with Mathematica Policy Research to conduct a descriptive study of Early Head Start programs. Baby FACES was designed to describe the national program and the experiences and development of children and families while enrolled in the program. It was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 89 Early Head Start programs and included two cohorts of children who were enrolled in spring 2009: newborns and 1-year-olds. The Newborn Cohort consisted of pregnant women and newborns under 9 weeks old and the 1-year-old Cohort included children ages 10 to 15 months old. The study followed the children and their parents, teachers, and home visitors annually while the children were in the program or until they turned 3.</p>
<p class="Normal" style="margin: 0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Arial; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal" style="margin: 0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Arial; font-size: medium;">OPRE plans to continue this tradition of Early Head Start research with a new round of Baby FACES (Baby FACES 2017) aiming to build on lessons learned to date and support ongoing improvement of Early Head Start program quality and the outcomes for the families they serve. Baby FACES 2017 will maintain an up-to-date, extensive knowledge base of the Early Head Start program to support policies and planning at the national level, inform technical assistance, and improve local operations and implementation. It will be designed to provide in depth descriptive information about EHS programs and services, their staff, and the children and families served.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

INTRODUCTION: 

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, "Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes" this Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is conducting a market survey and is seeking potential sources for the design-bid-build construction of a Combined Heat and Power Plant and New Steam Generation System project at the Dublin, GA VA Medical Center (VAMC). 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

In an effort to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption, the Department of Veterans Affairs has commissioned the design and construction of the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant and New Steam Generation System project at the Dublin VA Medical Center (VAMC) in Dublin, Laurens County, Georgia.

It is currently planned that the CHP and New Steam Generation System project will consist of a single 1.2 megawatt natural-gas fired, spark ignition engine generator which will provide peak-shaving electricity for the entire Dublin VAMC Campus.  The engine's rejected heat will be used to produce both steam and hot water with a portion of the steam driving a new 150-ton absorption chiller.  The prime gen set will provide a new, reliable, and efficient source of electrical generation, steam, as well as hot and cold water for the VAMC campus.  In addition, operation of the CHP will reduce emission levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gases when compared to conventional means of power generation and distribution.  Planned facility upgrades will also include replacement of the three (3) existing boilers with five (5) new 250-BHP dual-fired, fire-tube boilers with a new control room.

The project will include the construction of a new ~6,500 square foot building to house the generator and associated mechanical and electrical equipment.  The ground level of this two-story, pre-cast building will house the generator set (with a spare pad) with the heat-recovery steam generator placed on the mezzanine level.  The ground level will also accommodate two of the five boilers, with the remaining three being placed within the existing boiler room.  The 1st level will house the necessary electrical equipment.  Roof mounted equipment will include remote radiators and ventilation exhaust hoods.  New controls systems will integrate the new CHP plant and boilers into the facilities existing systems. CHP Plant designed to reduce sound via mass walls in chase & critical grade mufflers. New parallel switchgear will be installed and connections made within the existing switchgear building downstream of the existing meters (It must be noted that any required Georgia Power design services and/or infrastructure improvements have yet to be determined).

The design includes the addition of a 150-ton absorption chiller in the existing Chilled Water Plant and replacement of two existing 500 ton chillers in kind at that same location.  The addition of the absorption chiller will displace the existing motor control center, air handler, and strainer.  A new stand-alone building (approximately 20-foot by 27-foot) will be constructed adjacent to the Chilled Water Plant to house the displaced exiting motor control center.  The air handler and strainer will be reconfigured within the existing chiller plant.  The existing three-cell cooling tower will be replaced in kind re-using the foundation of the existing.

The Dublin VAMC lies within an attainment area, therefore, the generator will not require air emissions control equipment to meet regulatory requirements.  It is currently anticipated that the CHP plant can be permitted as a Synthetic Minor Air Source under current State of Georgia emissions regulations.  This project will attempt to obtain two (2) Green Globes utilizing the sustainability measurement tool of the Green Building Initiative (GBI). 

PROCUREMENT INFORMATION:

The proposed project will be a competitive, firm-fixed-price contract utilizing the design-bid-build approach. The anticipated solicitation will be issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR Part 15, considering technical and price-related factors included in the solicitation. However, the results and analysis of the market research will finalize the determination of the procurement method. The type of socio-economic set-aside, in any, will depend upon the responses to this notice and any other information gathered during the market research process. 

This project is planned for advertising in early May 2015. In accordance with VAAR 836.204, the magnitude of construction is between $10,000,000.00 and $20,000,000.00. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 237130 (size standard $36.5 million) applies to this procurement. The duration of the project is currently estimated at 540 calendar days from the issuance of a Notice to Proceed.

<DESC>1.0 Purpose & Background <br> Call No. W911W6-15-R-0008, Autonomous Sustainment Technologies for Rotorcraft Operations-Electrical (ASTRO-E), solicits proposals for development and demonstration of sustainment technologies for Army aircraft electrical systems.  The objective of the research is to develop and demonstrate technologies and methodologies to enable more efficient designs and reduce the maintenance burden for future and current fleet vertical lift aircraft. <br>  <br> Past applied research and advanced technology development efforts have focused on developing diagnostic, prognostic, and system health assessment technologies. This call seeks to extend these efforts by integrating sustainment technologies into the design process, real-time system control, mission planning and overall maintenance philosophy.  <br>  <br> This call will cover the technical area of the aircraft electrical system, with anticipation of one award.  ASTRO-E will enable design methodologies that leverage monitoring technologies to reduce weight, improve life, optimize performance and reduce maintenance burden. Integration of health assessment capabilities into real-time control is sought with the ability to adapt to faults and minimize component damage with nominal impact on performance.  <br> 2.0 Scope of Research Effort  <br> The Aviation Development Directorate-Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (ADD-AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals that encompass both 6.2 Applied Research, and 6.3 Advanced Technology Development. The starting Technology Readiness Level (TRL) may be as low as TRL 3 (characteristic proof of concept). Technologies are expected to be matured to a TRL 6/7 (system prototype demonstration in a relevant environment or flight test).   <br>  <br> The Government is seeking solutions in the rotorcraft electrical technology area.  This area is described in greater detail below.  Offerors may submit multiple proposals.  Each proposal shall describe an effort to address all of the requirements defined within the technology area description.  Offerors shall describe in their proposal a clear path to transition the proposed solution to current and/or future Army rotorcraft.  Offerors shall also describe and substantiate the anticipated operations and support benefits of their proposed solution. Offerors are strongly encouraged to take advantage of currently available technologies (sensors, algorithms, etc.) and existing aircraft data sources wherever possible.  Demonstration testing shall be full scale and representative of the expected aircraft operating environment and be of sufficient scope to demonstrate the capability, accuracy and robustness of the technologies. Although ASTRO-E is not a fielding effort, offerors should consider qualification requirements in the design and when proposing a technical approach (e.g. ADS-79D, MIL-STD-810G for system durability, MIL-STD-461F as modified by ADS-37A-PRF for EMI, MIL-STD-704F for aircraft power compatibility, DO-178C for software,  and DO-254 for hardware).   <br> 3.0 Performance Objectives and Technical Constraints <br> Considerable work has already been done developing diagnostic and prognostic technologies for the electrical system and electrical components.   The objective of this effort is to demonstrate a comprehensive integrated aircraft wide electrical system capability for diagnostics, fault isolation, and generate trendable health indicators.  The system should provide maintainers with accurate system wide fault isolation to reduce the burden associated with maintaining complicated electrical networks. The system should cover the aircraft buses, electrical wiring, connectors, power distribution, and LRUs.   This capability should allow the operator to make risk based decisions concerning the aircraft to prevent excessive down time for inspections and troubleshooting of electrical systems and components.  The integrated aircraft level solution shall demonstrate its capabilities using an onboard (ex: maintenance tab on an aircraft display) and/or off-board interface (ex: aircraft notebook).  The demonstration shall include the ability to trigger and analyze BIT checks, collect electrical system state data, detect wire faults, and prognose/diagnose the electrical system to include LRUs.  Approaches should consider failure modes to be detected, data handling and processing requirements, false removals, intermittent faults and the precision required for wire fault locations. The fault isolation capabilities should be executable from an onboard and/or off board system(s) with only aircraft or auxiliary power.  It is desired that weight, complexity, and use of special equipment be minimized to enable cost effective platform and support system integration and facilitate platform transition. Open systems architecture and use of common data standards are desired.  <br>  <br> Demonstration testing shall be full scale and representative of the expected aircraft operating environment and be of sufficient scope to demonstrate the capability, accuracy and robustness of the technologies.  Offerors should justify how the proposed testing meets TRL 6.  Offerors should consider transition of the technology to future vertical lift platforms and insertion of high payoff capabilities into the current fleet.  Program efforts shall identify the requirements to qualify and transition the technology.  <br>  <br> Proposed approaches should limit the amount of data that is transmitted off the aircraft by performing preprocessing on sensors, in an onboard processing unit, and/or utilize smart components.  Efforts should be made to substantiate that the proposed technology is better than currently fielded techniques and that the solution exhibits a greater probability of fault detection and accurate isolation than is currently available.    <br>  <br> 4.0 Call Specific Instructions <br> This call will use the Proposal Submission Process as described in 5.2 of the Broad Agency Announcement, as further supplemented below: <br>  <br> 4.1 Due Date for Proposals <br> As stated in the FedBizzOpps Announcement  <br>  <br> 4.2 Proposal Instructions <br> Specific instructions pertaining to the content and structure of provided proposals are provided in BAA W911W6-15-R-0004, paragraphs 5.2.2 and 5.2.3.

<DESC>Doing Business with DARPA Workshop
<p>DARPA has a singular mission: to make seminal investments in breakthrough technologies for national security. Through its investments, DARPA catalyzes the development of new capabilities that give the Nation technology-based options for preventing-and creating-strategic surprise. DARPA is designed to pursue opportunities for transformational change rather than incremental advances, and does so collaboratively as part of a robust innovation ecosystem that includes academic, corporate, and governmental partners.</p>
<p>DARPA's scientific investigations span the gamut from laboratory efforts to the creation of full-scale technology demonstrations in the fields of biology, medicine, computer science, chemistry, physics, engineering, mathematics, material sciences, social sciences, neurosciences and more. Today, DARPA is helping to build a future in which we can do extraordinary things: fully control the electromagnetic spectrum for communications, sensing, and imaging; provide precise and accurate position and timing that isn't reliant on GPS; wield cyber as a military capability with confidence in our own cybersecurity; increase access to and through space by lowering its cost; and open new operational regimes with advanced platforms and weapons. To build a strong foundation for tomorrow's military systems, we are catalyzing an advanced technology base in new areas of information technology, electronics, and materials science, as well as new technologies emerging from the biological sciences.</p>
<p>In an effort to inspire organizations to join its innovation ecosystem, DARPA's Security and Intelligence Directorate and Contracts Management Office will host a "Doing Business with DARPA Workshop" on April 24, 2015 from 0800-1200 at the Westin Hotel, Atlanta, GA.  This event is intended specifically for small companies that do not possess a DoD Facility Clearance but are interested in becoming eligible to perform on classified programs.</p>
<p>The goal of the workshop is to educate attendees about DoD processes associated with classified and controlled unclassified information contracts.  The DARPA Contracts Management Office will explain DARPA funding opportunities available through the Small Business Innovation Research Program, Small Business Technology Transfer Program, and Broad Agency Announcements; the DARPA Industrial Security and International Security sections will address questions pertaining to Export Control and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR); and the Defense Security Service Facility Clearance Branch will explain the processes for obtaining facility and personnel security clearances, to include issues such as Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) mitigation.</p>
<p>Attendees are asked to pre-register with Ms. Amethyst Leyva, amethyst.leyva.ctr@darpa.mil / 703-526-4173, or Ms. Nisha Lal, nisha.lal.ctr@darpa.mil / 571-526-4759.  Attendance is limited to the first 150 registrants.  There is no fee for attendance.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 22, is issuing this special notice to inform industry contractors of the intent to execute a Single Source Award as prescribed in FAR 13.106-1(b)(i) with Responder System Corporation, 16810 Valley View Ave, La Mirada, CA 90638.

Prior to soliciting, market research was conducted and concluded that Responder System Corporation is the authorized distributor and installer within the Southern California Region.  It was also verified with the Rauland-Borg's Government national accounts director that Responder System Corporation is the only authorized entity for the Southern California Region.  In accordance with FAR Part 13, specifically FAR 13.106-1(b)(i) there is only one (1) responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. 

This requirement is to purchase and install 15 additional Rauland-Borg Nurse Call station buttons with the existing Rauland-Borg Nurse Call station at the VA Long Beach Healthcare System.   

This procurement is being conducted using commercial item procedures pursuant to FAR Part 12 and FAR part 13.  This will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) award and an anticipated award date is set for March 6, 2015.  

The place of performance is as follows: VA Long Beach Healthcare System, 5901 E. 7th St., Long Beach, CA 90822. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 238210; and the Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard for this sector is $15,000,000. 

This notice of intent is neither a formal solicitation nor a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No award will be made on the basis of unsolicited quotations or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government.  The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for future requirements.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 

Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities no later than 1:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on March 13, 2015.  Interested shall e-mail all statements, quote, and capabilities; the senders bear full responsibility to ensure complete transmission and timely receipt.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposal or a request for quote.  There is no solicitation document available.  This is notice of intent of the Iowa Air National Guard (IANG) at the 132D Wing to award a sole source contract with Advantor Systems Corporation, for components, installation and training of an Advantor Intrusion Detection System for facility 430.  This is for a turn-key system. Though most of the components are available on Advantor's GSA schedule, this will be acquired through Advantor Systems Corporation via open market contract.   It is in the best interest of the Government to acquire the Advantor Intrusion Detection system through Advantor Systems Corporation in order to maintain interoperability and continuity of the other Advantor intrusion detection systems on base.  Also, the Government will benefit by ensuring consistent terms and conditions, maintenance and administrative cost savings by having all systems maintained through a single vendor. The strategies are in the best interest of the Federal Government and the price is fair and reasonable.  The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).  This procurement is being conducted using FAR Part 12 procedures. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  <br>  <br> Please reply no later than 16 March, 2015 at 11:59 a.m. Central Time to Patrick Olson at (515) 261-8523. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br> Iowa Air National Guard, 3100 McKinley Avenue <br> Des Moines, Iowa 50321-2722 <br>  <br> Point of Contact: <br> Patrick Olson <br>  <br> Contracting Superintendent

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Increase to Contract Ceilings
<SOLNBR>EP-W-11-044
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:gilham.michael@epa.gov">Michael Gilham</a>
<DESC>This justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management on behalf of the EPA Office of Compliance (OC).
The ceilings have been increased for the current two-year contract period of contract EP-W-11-044 with Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG) ? a cost-reimbursement Work Assignment contract which provides technical, analytical, and enforcement support for the OC.  The level of effort ceiling has been increased by 5,746 hours to a new total of 32,503 hours; and the total estimated cost ceiling has been increased by $611,571 to a new total of $3,167,080.  The need for this increase in effort was primarily driven by a much greater than anticipated need for support under Work Assignment 1-1 which provides for the modernization of EPA?s ECHO and OTIS websites.  The original estimate of required effort by the OC for the work that came to be provided under the discussed Work Assignment was done in 2009 during the solicitation planning phase for the current contract.  At that time, it was not clear that the ECHO and OTIS modernization efforts would be accorded the high level of priority  that ensued.  Moreover, the award of the contract was delayed for approximately 18 months as a result of a protest.  By the time that the modernization efforts were well underway during the current period (Option Period One), it had become clear that OC had significantly underestimated the required level of effort.  Therefore, the contract ceilings had to be increased to allow contractor support to continue.
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1:  only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.
The cease of support under the 14 active Work Assignments that would have resulted without the increase to the level of effort ceiling would have had a severe negative impact on the OC?s mission.  To solicit new contract support for the ongoing work being performed under the current Work Assignments would have been impractical as it would have resulted in the suspension of critical ongoing activities and, in addition, would have caused the agency significant administrative and financial burden.  Therefore, ERG was the only source available to perform the ongoing contract requirements.
The total cost and fixed fee proposed for the discussed additional level of effort were in accordance with the existing contract billing rates which were deemed fair and reasonable by the Contracting Officer at the time of award.  The indirect costs portion of ERG?s proposal was in accordance with the current agency approved indirect cost rates.  Thus, the costs for the increased level of effort were determined to be fair and reasonable.
Market research was not conducted for increasing the contract ceilings as performing such was not applicable to the given scenario. The agency will not take any measures to remove barriers to competition through the maximum expiration date of the contract because such action would be impractical as discussed in the foregoing. However, it is anticipated that a successor to the current contract will be awarded using full and open competition. 
Contracting Officer Certification: This is to certify that his JOFOC has been reviewed and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the information provided to support the rationale and recommendation for approval is accurate and complete.
Michael Gilham [Electronic signature of physical document]  3/2/15 Contracting Officer, Office of Acquisition Management
Technical or Requirements Personnel Certification:  This is to certify that the provided supporting information which is the responsibility of the undersigned program representative is accurate and complete.
Michael  Richardson, [Electronic signature of physical document]  3/2/15 Contracting Officer?s Representative, OC

<DESC>The US General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement to replace the temporary bollards on Causeway Street and Lomasney Way with new fixed security bollards at the perimeter of the Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr. Federal Building, 10 Causeway Street, Boston, MA 02222.  GSA has identified the following key circumstances for the project:<br /><br />A) To comply with Interagency Security Criteria - Physical Security Criteria for Federal Facilities and the GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) Site Security Design Guide standards, the bollards are, and must be, located on property owned by the City of Boston (henceforth "the City").<br /><br />B) The City's Public Works Department issued a full and open solicitation for street and sidewalk improvements in the immediate area around the O'Neill Building including on Causeway Street and on Lomasney Way in Capital Improvement Project 14-22: Connect Historic Boston.<br /><br />C) The City's project has scheduled the temporary bollards to be replaced / reconfigured; GSA has proposed to take advantage of the opportunity to replace the temporary bollards in coordination with the City's excavation of the existing sidewalk, which will result in a reduced cost to GSA and the taxpayer.
<p><br />GSA intends to fulfill its requirement for new fixed security bollards by awarding a firm-fixed-price contract to the awardee of the City's contract as the only responsible source without providing for full and open competition.  The Justification and Approval for other than full and open competition is attached to this notice.<br /><br />The magnitude of construction for the instant contract is estimated between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 (FAR 36.204).</p>

&nbsp;The Government reserves the right to order in whole or in part.<br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br> (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br> (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to Sole Source due to registered proprietary systems.
<p>Statement of Work</p>
<p>Institute for People, Place, and Possibility (IP3)</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Heart disease and stroke are leading causes of death in the United States. They are the principal causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) death and are also major causes of disability. Approximately 800,000 people die in the United States each year from cardiovascular diseases-that's 1 in every 3 deaths. Nearly 2 million heart attacks and strokes occur every year, and CVD costs the nation $195 billion annually in direct medical expenses.</p>
<p>In September 2011, the CDC and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) launched Million Hearts&reg; &reg;, an initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. Million Hearts&reg;, which is housed in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP), empowers Americans to make healthy choices and rallies communities, health care professionals, health systems, nonprofit organizations, federal agencies, and private-sector organizations to support their goal and prevention activities. Million Hearts&reg; brings together existing efforts and new programs and partners to improve health across communities and helps Americans live longer, healthier, more productive lives.</p>
<p>This year, DHDSP would like to continue the design, maintenance, and promotion of the Millions Hearts&reg; &reg; group space (or hub) on Community Commons, an interactive, web-based, mapping networking and learning platform operated by the Institute for People, Place, and Possibility (IP3), a not-for-profit organization based in Columbia, Missouri. The Community Commons Million Hearts&reg; (CCMH) hub provides an online community where Million Hearts&reg; partners and supporters can connect, collaborate, and highlight their efforts to prevent heart attacks and strokes. The CCMH hub was developed in 2013 and requires continued maintenance, enhancement, and promotion to assist the initiative in achieving its overarching goals.</p>
<p><br />II. PURPOSE <br />In Fiscal Year (FY) 2015, the vendor shall provide hosting, design improvements, content curation, pledge map creation, and communication and promotional support for the hub. These services will expand the reach and impact of Million Hearts&reg; and help the initiative further engage its partners, gain new supporters, share and leverage information, and maximize educational and partnership efforts.</p>
<p>Community Commons also has the capability to design and distribute tailored tools and resources, including technology that can convert Million Hearts&reg; unique partnership pledge data into map formats (or pledge maps). The maps, which are highly utilized by the Million Hearts&reg; staff, will be distributed to members of the CCMH hub and promoted as needed. In addition, Community Commons provides communication support by responding to member inquiries, highlighting current CVD data and research, sharing social media posts and updates, and promoting membership to the CCMH hub. Data gained from the Community Commons Million Hearts&reg; hub can be used to inform DHDSP programmatic and communication activities, research and evaluation analyses, planning efforts, and strategies for partner outreach.</p>
<p>The CCMH hub is linked to the initiative's website (http://millionHearts&reg; .hhs.gov/index.html) and will be used by CDC, DHDSP, and Million Hearts&reg; &reg; partners, grantees, and other external stakeholders, as well as consumers and the general public.</p>
<p>III . SCOPE OF WORK <br />The vendor will provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to complete the tasks outlined below to ensure that the Community Commons Million Hearts&reg; hub is enhanced, updated, and maintained in FY 2015. Travel is not anticipated and is not included in this contract. The vendor shall provide updates on progress to CDC as outlined in the deliverables schedule.</p>
<p>IV. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED <br />The vendor shall perform the following tasks to enhance, update, and maintain the hub in FY 2015:</p>
<p><br />1. Collect and reformat Million Hearts&reg; pledge data into maps<br />2. Create and format pledge maps and organizational pledge count documents<br />3.

Provide communication support to new group members and encourage dialogue and engagement, post new stories and resources, refer members to Million Hearts&reg; pledge maps and data, and provide timely responses to member inquiries <br />6. Highlight Million Hearts&reg; media stories, (e.g., Million Hearts&reg; Hypertension Control Champions) on the Community Commons web page<br />7. Share/highlight Million Hearts&reg; Facebook and Twitter updates on the Community Commons home page<br />8. Co-host a Tweetchat with Million Hearts&reg; to increase awareness and partner engagement<br />9.

<p>VIII. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 USC 754 [d])</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services.<br />There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board's Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board's standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR).<br />Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The following Section 508 provisions apply to the content or communications material identified in this SOW:<br />&bull; 36 CFR 1194.21, 22, .32, and .41<br />Checklists for final acceptance for various file formats are available from http://www.hhs.gov/web/508/. CDC reserves the right to reject any deliverable or work product failing to meet these requirements. Contractor shall make all electronic materials 508 compliant.<br />References:<br />HHS Policy for Section 508 Electronic and Information Technology (E&amp;IT) (January 2005): http://www.hhs.gov/od/Final_Section_508_Policy.html<br />HHS Section 508 Web site: http://508.hhs.gov/<br />HHS ASPA Web Communications Division Web site: http://www.hhs.gov/web/policies/index.html<br />US General Services Administration (GSA) Section 508 Web site: http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm<br />HHS Section 508 Evaluation Product Accessibility Template (PAT): http://www.hhs.gov/od/vendors/index.html</p>

A new maintenance system for ICD is planned for future implementation with support for output into formats that can be loaded into database systems and other computer applications. This will provide for interoperability with other external systems both in business and government, enabling smoother updates in use of the ICD-10-CM as a future standard, in support of the President's emphasis on government support for health information technology, via enhanced support for updates to computerized medical record systems. This system is to support use of the Apelon Distributed Terminology System (DTS) as part of a system for future maintenance of the ICD-10-CM.</p>
<p>Concurrent with development and implementation of the Apelon DTS system for the ICD-10-CM, there has been development of an automated system for conversion to the Folio Infobase format for ICD-10-CM with traditional appearance, from DTS output files. There have been changes to certain file structures used for updating ICD-10-CM, and also an update to Folio, and the system needs to be updated for compatibility. There is also a need for data verification, involving detailed content comparison between the current and updated versions that have been manually edited, and the version created from DTS, with provision for correction of any content issues or issues found in algorithms for automated creation of the files.</p>
<p><br />C.2 PROJECT OBJECTIVE -<br />To enhance and update the automated system for creating ICD-10-CM files for publishing and distribution of ICD-10-CM from structured files output from the Apelon Distributed Terminology System (DTS), and ensure compatibility with the most recent update of Folio. Publishing shall support fast structured searches and linking, with traditional appearance of the ICD as currently provided, using the Folio Infobase format. Detailed verification of data with the updated and original manually edited Folio version of ICD-10-CM shall be performed. Various formats to support multiple uses are to be made available concurrently. Output from Folio Infobase to Folio Flat File (FFF) format is planned, with subsequent conversion to XML to be supported, via creation of a stand-alone program to convert ICD-10-CM from FFF format to XML, with the XML schema to be determined by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR), with input from the contractor.</p>
<p><br />C.3 SCOPE OF WORK - <br />Task (1): The contractor will update the system that enables automated creation of ICD-10-CM files for publishing and distribution from structured output files from the Apelon Distributed Terminology System (DTS), to enable handling any updates in the structure of the original files, and for consistency with Folio updates.</p>
<p>Task (2): Test automated creation of ICD-10-CM files using the most recent data in DTS.</p>
<p>Task (3): Verify updated ICD-10-CM data originating from DTS with original Folio files.</p>
<p>Task (4): Create a stand-alone program to convert ICD-10-CM from FFF format to XML</p>
<p><br />C.4 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS - <br />The vendor shall perform the following tasks to accomplish the purpose of updating the system for automated creation of ICD-10-CM files for publishing and distribution.</p>
<p>Task (1): The contractor will use updated structured output files from the Apelon DTS, which will be supplied to the contractor in a structured format to be determined by the COR in agreement with the contractor. The complete system will handle conversion of the following ICD-10-CM components.</p>
<p>&#61607; Tabular list of diseases<br />&#61607; Index to diseases and injuries<br />&#61607; Index to external causes of injury<br />&#61607; Table of drugs and chemicals<br />&#61607; Table of Neoplasms</p>
<p><br />The software version for publishing and distribution will be determined by the COR (e.g., the latest released version of Folio).</p>
<p>Separate files must have links between them, similar to those currently found in the official ICD-9-CM CD-ROM Folio Infobases.</p>
<p>All entries must be able to be searched, as supported by the Folio Infobase format, by assigning to a group to allow for their use within a query template. Searching is to meet NCHS specifications, as directed by the COR. For example, using Folio currently, the tabular query template has the capability to search on a code number, and the index query template has the capability to search on a level 2 term (main term), followed by a search on a level 3 term (subterm).</p>
<p>The contractor must make any modifications to the system that fall within contract specifications deemed necessary by the COR during the contract period. This shall include enhancements and programming to provide for formatting changes as deemed necessary by the COR.</p>
<p>Final updated version of the system for creation of ICD-10-CM files shall be presented to COR.</p>
<p>Task (2): Testing of the automated system for creation of ICD-10-CM files shall use updated data in the Apelon DTS. This shall be performed under direction from the COR. Resulting files shall be reviewed by both the contractor and the COR, and others as designated by the COR.</p>
<p>Task (3): Verification of the updated ICD-10-CM data originating from the Apelon DTS as converted to the Folio Infobase format shall be done by direct comparison with original existing ICD-10-CM Folio files, using an approach determined by the COR in agreement with the contractor (e.g., utilizing Folio Flat File format or text format for comparison).</p>
<p>Task (4): Creation of a stand-alone software system to convert ICD-10-CM date files from FFF format to XML, with the XML schema to be determined by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR), with input from the contractor. Delivery of all parts of software system to enable conversion from FFF format to XML.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />C.6 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS - <br />The vendor may require travel to NCHS/CDC offices in Hyattsville, MD or communications with NCHS/CDC to obtain materials needed to complete these tasks.</p>
<p><br />C.7 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY - <br />The vendor will provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to complete the tasks described, for the purpose of producing a system for automated production of ICD-10-CM files.</p>
<p><br />C.8 REFERENCES - <br />ICD-10-CM files in structured output formats, to be made available from the COR or other NCHS/CDC staff.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 USC 794d) <br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Provisions (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit:<br />(1) Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and<br />(2) Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.<br />Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotation/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility provisions. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access- board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm.<br />The Section 508 standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found at http://508.hhs.gov.<br />Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products and/or services that are incidental to the project, which might constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products and/or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government - i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products and/or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.<br />The Applicable provisions of this solicitation are: 1194.21, .22, .31, and .41. Mobile applications are subject to the CDC Mobile Checklist at time of award.</p>

Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-

PRICE and NON-PRICE EVALUATION. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following non-price/cost factors, listed in descending value, shall be used to evaluate offers: 

Factor (A) Fan System.  Offerors must provide documentation, not to exceed 10 pages, describing the offered fan system's ability to meet or exceed the specifications contained in the Project Manual; 

Factor (B) Fan System Installation Plan, Experience and Approach:  Offerors must provide an Installation Plan which shall include schedule and timeline. The project schedule shall be a chart which graphically depicts the proposed sequence to accomplish each work feature or operation. It shall show start dates and completion dates for each event on a horizontal time scale. Offerors must provide a narrative, not to exceed two pages, describing their capabilities and approach to perform the installation services described in the Statement of Work.  Offerors must describe their experience within the last three years with fan system installation similar to the current project in terms of: (a) Size/type and commercial application of fan installed; (b) Requirement to coordinate full or partial shut-down of customer's operations to accommodate the fan installation; (c) Level of compliance with State and Local electric and fire codes required in project performance; and (d) experience with similar projects requiring compliance with State and Local electrical and fire codes of Madison, WI;

Factor (C) Past Performance: Offerors must submit not less than two references for fan systems with installation services performed during the past three years.  Each reference shall include: the company or agency name, address, contract or order number, point(s) of contract phone number and email address(es).  References provided may be contacted by the Government.  Their statements will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's offer.  In addition, any information obtained by the Government from references outside of the offerors offer may also be used, in a similar manner, in the technical evaluation of the offeror's offer  to the extent appropriate. Past performance information provided by references, from Government records, or from other than the sources identified by the offeror may be used in the evaluation under any or all applicable evaluation factors.  In addition to the foregoing, PIPRS.gov will be used as a source of past performance information in the source selection process, in addition to any other past performance information required under this solicitation.  All past performance information will be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision; and 

Factor (D) Safety Plan and Record: Offerors must provide a Safety Plan and a list of safety violations for the past three years. The Safety Plan must meet the minimum requirements described in the Removal and Installation Statement of Work.  The list of safety violations will include all local, state, and Federal citations and resolutions. 

Offers submitted in response to this solicitation will be evaluated based upon the non-price or non-cost factors.

(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

Award. The award of this requirement shall be made using only the procedures found in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 13.5.  Award shall be made to the offeror whose offer, conforming to this solicitation, is determined to be the most advantages to the Government, cost or price and the other non-cost or non-price factors listed above.  In determining which offer offers the greatest value or advantage to the Government, overall merit of the non-cost/price factors will be considered more important than price or cost.  The degree of importance of price or cost as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality in the technical merits of the quotes.  Between acceptable quotes with a significant difference in technical merit, a determination will be made as to whether the additional technical merit or benefits reflected by a higher priced quote warrants payment of the additional price or cost.

Proposal Preparation and Submission. 

The offeror is cautioned to study the Evaluation Factors stated above along with their relative importance.  Your offer package shall address each of these factors since these are the standards against which your offer will be evaluated.   It is the offeror's responsibility to include the appropriate documentation in its offer package to allow a complete technical/price evaluation.  Failure to submit the appropriate documentation may result in the rejection of the offer.

Offers shall be in two volumes.  Volume One shall be non-price support documentation. Volume Two shall be price documentation which includes the signed SF 1449 and all amendments.

Offers will only be received electronically via either: using the FedConnect (www.fedconnect.net) systems or by email to Don Downey, ddowney@usgs.gov.

<p>8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT<br />(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products.

In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).<br />(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.<br />(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Access to the gate installation site is over a narrow dirt road with minimal turn around areas so coordination with the onsite personnel is needed for off-loading of the gate as close to the installation location as possible for the delivery vehicle. <BR> <BR>

To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Stacey Swader Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-4825 Email: stacey.l.swader.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.

PRICE and NON-PRICE EVALUATION. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following non-price/cost factors, listed in descending value, shall be used to evaluate offers: 

Factor (A) Fan System.  Offerors must provide documentation, not to exceed 10 pages, describing the offered fan system's ability to meet or exceed the specifications contained in the Project Manual; 

Factor (B) Fan System Installation Plan, Experience and Approach:  Offerors must provide an Installation Plan which shall include schedule and timeline. The project schedule shall be a chart which graphically depicts the proposed sequence to accomplish each work feature or operation. It shall show start dates and completion dates for each event on a horizontal time scale. Offerors must provide a narrative, not to exceed two pages, describing their capabilities and approach to perform the installation services described in the Statement of Work.  Offerors must describe their experience within the last three years with fan system installation similar to the current project in terms of: (a) Size/type and commercial application of fan installed; (b) Requirement to coordinate full or partial shut-down of customer's operations to accommodate the fan installation; (c) Level of compliance with State and Local electric and fire codes required in project performance; and (d) experience with similar projects requiring compliance with State and Local electrical and fire codes of Madison, WI;

Factor (C) Past Performance: Offerors must submit not less than two references for fan systems with installation services performed during the past three years.  Each reference shall include: the company or agency name, address, contract or order number, point(s) of contract phone number and email address(es).  References provided may be contacted by the Government.  Their statements will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's offer.  In addition, any information obtained by the Government from references outside of the offerors offer may also be used, in a similar manner, in the technical evaluation of the offeror's offer  to the extent appropriate. Past performance information provided by references, from Government records, or from other than the sources identified by the offeror may be used in the evaluation under any or all applicable evaluation factors.  In addition to the foregoing, PIPRS.gov will be used as a source of past performance information in the source selection process, in addition to any other past performance information required under this solicitation.  All past performance information will be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision; and 

Factor (D) Safety Plan and Record: Offerors must provide a Safety Plan and a list of safety violations for the past three years. The Safety Plan must meet the minimum requirements described in the Removal and Installation Statement of Work.  The list of safety violations will include all local, state, and Federal citations and resolutions. 

Offers submitted in response to this solicitation will be evaluated based upon the non-price or non-cost factors.

(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

Award. The award of this requirement shall be made using only the procedures found in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 13.5.  Award shall be made to the offeror whose offer, conforming to this solicitation, is determined to be the most advantages to the Government, cost or price and the other non-cost or non-price factors listed above.  In determining which offer offers the greatest value or advantage to the Government, overall merit of the non-cost/price factors will be considered more important than price or cost.  The degree of importance of price or cost as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality in the technical merits of the quotes.  Between acceptable quotes with a significant difference in technical merit, a determination will be made as to whether the additional technical merit or benefits reflected by a higher priced quote warrants payment of the additional price or cost.

Proposal Preparation and Submission. 

The offeror is cautioned to study the Evaluation Factors stated above along with their relative importance.  Your offer package shall address each of these factors since these are the standards against which your offer will be evaluated.   It is the offeror's responsibility to include the appropriate documentation in its offer package to allow a complete technical/price evaluation.  Failure to submit the appropriate documentation may result in the rejection of the offer.

Offers shall be in two volumes.  Volume One shall be non-price support documentation. Volume Two shall be price documentation which includes the signed SF 1449 and all amendments.

Offers will only be received electronically via either: using the FedConnect (www.fedconnect.net) systems or by email to Don Downey, ddowney@usgs.gov.

Questions and Comment Submissions.  Questions and comments received within the last 5 days before the response due date will be considered untimely and may not receive a response.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.  <br>  <br> (2)  <br>  <br> (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name,  quote mark doing business as quote mark  name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to: <br>  <br> (A) Change the name in the SAM database;  <br>  <br> (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; <br>  <br> (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an  quote mark I agree quote mark  click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g.,  quote mark click-wrap quote mark  or  quote mark browse-wrap quote mark  agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br>  <br> (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br>  <br> (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <br>  <br> (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. <br>  <br> (End of Clause) <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), located at 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134, has a requirement to procure a Scout Sniper Day Scope Improved Mount (SSDS-IM). The SSDS-IM is a one-piece mounting solution that does not require the use of tools for rail attachment for the following weapon platforms: M110 and M107. The SSDS-IM is a commercial item under FAR 2.101 because several offerors offer similar improved mount systems for sale to the general public that can potentially meet the performance specifications for this effort. Per FAR 2.101, a commercial item is any item, other than real property, that is of a type customarily used by the general public or by non-governmental entities for purposes other than governmental purposes, and has been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; or has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public. By conducting market research, the Marine Corps learned that the general public uses a one-piece mounting solution on commercially purchased rifles that have the same rail mechanism for mounting as the Marine Corps M110 &amp; M107 rifles. To offer the one-piece mounting solution to the general public, several vendors who manufacture the one-piece mounting solution list the item for sale via internet websites for mail delivery and offer items in retail sportsman stores.</span></p>

<DESC>The following questions were asked of the Government relating to the subject requirement which are hereby posted and responded to.
Question and Answer:
Question:	The solicitation states, "The work shall be done by a licensed and National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) accredited company."  Do you mean that the asbestos samples are to be tested by a NVLAP accredited laboratory or that the company performing the contract is required to be a NVLAP accredited laboratory?  It is my understanding that the NVLAP accreditation is for laboratories only.  
Answer: 	The testing shall be done by a NVLAP accredited laboratory is what is meant.
Question:	What are considered as "after hours"? Please provide the normal operating hours of the facilities that are to be inspected. 
Answer:	Normal operating hours are from 8:00 AM - 4:30 PM.
Question:	What is the average ceiling height in finished areas? In unfinished areas?
Answer:	Ceiling height in finish areas are average 8', Ceiling height in unfinished areas average 12'- 15'.
Question:	Has there been a previous asbestos inspection performed for this facility? If so, will the report be made available to prospective bidders? 
Answer:	Yes, 2009 Survey does not meet NESHAP Requirement.

<DESC>Question:	In regards to the referenced solicitation, can you clarify the requirements for licensure for the Asbestos Survey Professional? There are statements within the solicitation about lab licensure requirements, but there is limited information on the Asbestos Survey Professional.
Answer: 	Yes, The VA requires the contractor to comply with State of Florida licensure requirements.  IT IS THE VA THAT MANDATES THIS COMPLIANCE.  In addition, the VA mandates the author of an asbestos project design to meet the AHERA requirements of attendance in an EPA MAP accredited training program for Asbestos Project Designer.  The final Statement of Work will be revised to incorporate this information.
  Question:	When I received confirmation on my request to attend the site visit, I received an e-mail stating that we are to meet in room 328 of Building 24.  Please verify that it is room 328, as the instructions originally stated room 327.
Answer: 	All vendors are to meet in room 328 of Building 24.  There was an error on the site visit instructions that incorrectly listed room 327.

The following questions were asked of the Government relating to the subject requirement which are hereby posted and responded to.
Question and Answer:
(1) Question:	The solicitation states, "The work shall be done by a licensed and National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) accredited company."  Do you mean that the asbestos samples are to be tested by a NVLAP accredited laboratory or that the company performing the contract is required to be a NVLAP accredited laboratory?  It is my understanding that the NVLAP accreditation is for laboratories only.  
Answer: 	The inspector performing the work must meet Chapter 469 of the Florida Statutes and Rule 61E1 of the Florida Administrative Code regarding asbestos licensing.   The laboratory that will be used to analyses samples for asbestos content must be NVLAP accredited. 

(2) Question:	What are considered as "after hours"? Please provide the normal operating hours of the facilities that are to be inspected. 
Answer:	Normal operating hours are from 8:00 AM - 4:30 PM.

(3) Question:	What is the average ceiling height in finished areas? In unfinished areas?
Answer:	Ceiling height in finish areas are average 8', Ceiling height in unfinished areas average 12'- 15'.

(4) Question:	Has there been a previous asbestos inspection performed for this facility? If so, will the report be made available to prospective bidders? 
Answer:	Yes, 2009 Survey does not meet NESHAP Requirement.

(5) Question:	In regards to the referenced solicitation, can you clarify the requirements for licensure for the Asbestos Survey Professional? There are statements within the solicitation about lab licensure requirements, but there is limited information on the Asbestos Survey Professional.
Answer: 	Yes, The VA requires the contractor to comply with State of Florida licensure requirements.  IT IS THE VA THAT MANDATES THIS COMPLIANCE.  In addition, the VA mandates the author of an asbestos project design to meet the AHERA requirements of attendance in an EPA MAP accredited training program for Asbestos Project Designer.  The final Statement of Work will be revised to incorporate this information.

(6) Question:	When I received confirmation on my request to attend the site visit, I received an e-mail stating that we are to meet in room 328 of Building 24.  Please verify that it is room 328, as the instructions originally stated room 327.
Answer: 	All vendors are to meet in room 328 of Building 24.  There was an error on the site visit instructions that incorrectly listed room 327.

(7) Question:	
(a) The VA has delineated sampling locations with an orange sticker.  Depending upon the Square Footage AHERA allows the inspector to collect 3, 5, or 7 samples for homogenous building materials that are the same and have them analyzed by the accredited laboratory.  Are we allowed to follow this guideline or does the VA expect a sample to be collected at all orange sticker locations and analyzed by the accredited laboratory? 
(b) Is the orange sticker indicating the building material to be sampled and then analyzed? or is it indicating a location to be inspected and if suspicious building material is discovered that should be collected and analyzed ? (i.e ceiling tile with orange sticker, insulation above ceiling tile, concrete that may be drilled into, caulking, black waterproofing coating, etc)
Answer:
(a) 	VA expects samples to be collected at all orange sticker locations.  The sampling methodology will satisfy the EPA NESHAP requirements for renovation or demolition "to thoroughly inspect the affected facility" and the Pinellas County  Code of Ordinances Section 58-149, in accordance with NESHAP requirements and ASTM E2356, be analyzed by the accredited laboratory.
(b)	Orange sticker is indicating a location that sample is to be taken and tested.

(8) Question:	In section 6.0 Infection Prevention Measures, It states "The contractor shall use containment chambers and negative air machine."  Will this be required to collect every sample?
Answer:	Yes at minimum there is a fire rated plastic or a containment cube is also acceptable as well as a HEPA Vacuum.

(9) Question:	In the SOW, Section B.3 "Subcontracting Commitments - Monitoring & Compliance" mention is made that an evaluation factor would be VAAR 852.215-70, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business.  Is the VA indicating that if an SDVOB or VOB that would help in winning the award or is the VA just basing the award on price alone?
Answer:	The award will be based on Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) methodology as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  

(10) Question:	Please describe the level of security clearance required for the technicians to complete this project. What documents must the technicians provide to attain this security clearance?  How long will it take to process through the VA's security program? 
Answer: 	Contractor will be provided badges prior to arrival, Federal or State ID is required.

(11) Question:	
(a) In the SOW it states "The contractor shall be responsible for all patching, painting, and repair caused by the sampling and testing.   Drywall repair is typically accomplished by patching with white joint compound.  Is this acceptable as a repair?   
Is the VA expecting the contractor to also paint over the patch?  What color of paint?   Yes color will be provided.

(b) For ceiling tiles with a metal grid, a sample is usually collected behind the metal grid holding it into place.  After sample collection & replacement of the tile the sampling location is usually hidden behind the metal grid.  Is this acceptable as a repair?  For drywall or plaster ceilings this technique may not be possible. Is it acceptable to patch sampling locations with white joint compound and consider it repaired? Is the VA expecting the contractor to also paint over the patch?  If so, will the VA provide the paint or will the contractor be responsible for purchasing the paint?   
Answer:	
(a) 	Sampling behind the grid is acceptable for replacement.
(b) 	Paint is required, VA will provide color, contractor to purchase and complete the painting.

(12) Question:	In the SOW, Section 6.0 "Infection Prevention Measures" mention is made that "All personnel involved in the construction or renovation activity shall be educated and trained in infection prevention measures established by the medical center".  For what time period should the contractor allow for the training? Do all on-site technicians need this training?
Answer:	Contractor shall allow 30 minutes on the first day for training, all technicians shall need training.

(13) Question:	What is the tallest ceiling height we may need to collect a sample from? Is there a breakdown of the various ceiling heights.
Answer:	The tallest ceiling height is about 25', Ceiling height in finish areas are average 8', Ceiling height in unfinished areas average 12'- 15'.  Please note that these are not exact measurements but are close and that all vendor s had the ability to take their own measurements during the site visit.

(14) Question:	Mention was made during the tour that fireproof material would be required in the Mental Health building?  The tour guide mentioned poly that may be used to set up containment. So we need to use fireproof containment material?  I don't know if that is available? Can this be elaborated on?
Answer:	Yes at minimum there is a fire rated plastic or a containment cube is also acceptable as well as a HEPA Vacuum, also guidelines for working in the mental health is provided.

<DESC>The Mortar Weapon System Request for Proposal (RFP), W15QKN-15-R-0017, shall be released in three (3) Parts. The Part 2 release is as follows:  <br>  <br> 1) Part 2 will consist of DRAFT versions of all Sections A through K of the uniform contract format. This includes any revisions/updates that were made to Sections B and C, which were originally posted in the Part 1 release on 10 February 2015. Therefore, the previous versions of Sections B and C are now obsolete and these revised versions take complete precedence under Part 2. All attachments found under Section J of the DRAFT Part 2 Section A through K are attached in this Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) announcement. Part 2 will provide offerors with an opportunity to review and become familiar with all necessary Clauses, Provisions, and Attachments to be included in Sections A through K.   <br>  <br> 2) To obtain a copy of the Technical Data Package (TDP), offerors will be required to submit the following forms: Military Critical Technical Data Agreement (DD Form 2345) (Attachment 0005), Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) (Attachment 0004), and an AMSTA-AR 1350 (Attachment 0006), which are attached in this Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) announcement. These forms and documents can be sent via e-mail to the Point of Contract/Contract Specialist listed in Section A. Once completed and returned, it will then be determined by the Government to give access for the Technical Data Packages (TDPs) in DRAFT form to the offerors. The DRAFT TDPs will be located under the (Packages) tab of this FBO announcement.  <br>  <br> Note: Please be advised that the Technical Data Package (TDP) for the M326 Mortar Stowage Kit is now available for release at this time.  <br>  <br> 3) Part 3 is still expected to be released within approximately 30 calendar days (if not sooner) and will constitute the complete and final version of the RFP. Part 3 will include Sections L and M, which shall provide all necessary instructions for submitting a proposal to the Government and information as to how that proposal will be evaluated. Again, following the release of Part 3, the Government reserves the right to cancel, edit, or amend any RFP Section prior to the final date for submission of proposals.  <br>  <br> The Government is not soliciting any proposal submissions in response to the DRAFT Sections of the RFP that will be released with Parts 1 and 2. The final date for submission of proposals will be included in the Final RFP released as Part 3. <br>  <br> The Point of Contact for this notification and any questions may be directed to Mr. Kyle Thalmann via E-mail ONLY: kyle.p.thalmann.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, in support of the Joint Program Executive Office - Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Program Manager - Guardian Product Manager - Joint Force Protection Systems (JPdM-FPS) has a continued requirement for Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System Increment 5 (ICIDS V).  ICIDS is a highly secure, standardized Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using state-of the-art commercial technology.  ICIDS provides Commanders the means to detect and assess the unauthorized intrusion or attempted intrusion of protected areas.  ICIDS is used by security and law enforcement agencies at Department of Defense (DoD) worldwide Installations providing a standard intrusion detection capability to protect critical facilities.  <br>    <br>  The ICIDS-V contract will be awarded as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small  <br>  Business (SDVOSB) set aside to support promotion of socio-economic goals.  The Government anticipates a single, six-year, Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a two-year base ordering period and four one-year optional ordering periods, with a ceiling of $99M.    <br>    <br>  The ICIDS-V acquisition approach is based on the use and integration of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components.  A single DO will be awarded for each Installation that includes site survey, site design, hardware and software acquisition and integration, fielding, Cybersecurity and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  This acquisition will ensure the ICIDS-V systems fielded across all Installations are based on one integrated, Government-approved system configuration.    <br>    <br>  The Government anticipates releasing a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) on or about 30 January 2015 that will be open for fourteen (14) days.  There will be NO Pre-Proposal Conference or Industry Day.  Comments related to this Synopsis should be submitted via email to jennifer.a.kotar.ctr@mail.mil from the Natick Contracting Division.  <br>    <br>

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to provide a response to questions received in response to the Sources Sought.
<p>Question 1: Will pre-printed straps be part of the requirement going forward?</p>
<p>Answer 1: Yes, this requirement is for Pre-Printed paper currency strap bands and unprinted paper currency bundle bands suitable for use on LEPE (Large Examining and Printing Equipment) note processing equipment for wrapping and containing Federal Reserve Notes (FRN) at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing; hereinafter referred to as BEP.</p>
<p>See attached requirement specifications - Figures 1 and 2 show examples of the 14 different printed currency note strap bands (two for each denomination with solid color borders for regular currency and striped color bands for star note currency). The 15th currency band is an unprinted currency note bundle band. All 15 rolls of bands, printed and unprinted, require heat-sealable polyethylene coated backing, as specified.</p>
<p>Question 2: Can you clarify your requirement here?</p>
<p>Answer 2: The LEPE Currency Straps requirement is separate from the ECF Currency Straps requirement posted previously under BEP-RFP-13-0206 (https://www.fbo.gov/spg/TREAS/BEP/OPDC20220/BEP-RFP-13-0206/listing.html) and WCF Currency Straps requirement posted previously under BEP-RFP-11-0023 (https://www.fbo.gov/spg/TREAS/BEP/OPDC20220/BEP-RFP-11-0023/listing.html)</p>

The correct version of the SOW was uploaded. 

The FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center has a requirement for environmental architecture and engineering (A&E) services.  Prospective activities include field investigations, production of plans, specifications, studies, calculations, estimates, laboratory analyses, preparation of worker health and safety, sampling and other plans, field sampling (including groundwater, soil, sediment, surface water and air), and detailed counter-measure plans; noise evaluations; industrial waste water pretreatment; air quality (including indoor air quality; environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental due diligence audits (EDDAs); hazardous material storage and handling; groundwater assessments; SARA Title III program; PCB abatement; pollution prevention opportunity assessment, and fuel storage tank management. (See attached Statement of Work.)

PLEASE NOTE THE ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER OF THIS SOLICITION WAS DTFAAC-14-R-04721 AND IT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO DTFAAC-15-R-02523.

It is anticipated than an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract, with fixed labor hour provisions, will be awarded covering these environmental A&E services.  Requirements are estimated at $960,000 per year.  The resultant contract will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size effort applicable to this requirement:
NAICS:  541620 Environmental Consulting Services
Size Standard:  $15.0 Million

This acquisition is an A&E procurement that is obliged to comply with The Brooks Act (40 USC 1101).  The award process involves the evaluation of architectural and engineering services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the type of professional services required at fair and reasonable prices.  The evaluation process will not take price into consideration until the most technically qualified and competent firm is selected.

A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).

The A&E firms submission of Standard Form (SF) 330 must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors.  The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Specific evaluation factors include: 

1. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence- 

The offeror must provide a specific narrative and supporting documentation that describes the offeror's technical and managerial capabilities in the specialized area of environmental A/E services.  Emphasis will be placed on the Contractors experience, especially on contracts for similar services and magnitude, and the depth and breadth of understanding of the solicited requirement as reflected in the proposal.  It includes an evaluation of example projects (detailed reviews) illustrating technical and managerial capabilities in each of the following areas:
	Environmental assessment (NEPA) or environmental due diligence audit
	Pollution prevention project implementation (can include permit compliance projects)
	Environmental Compliance
	Air emissions reporting and evaluation projects
	Asbestos Surveys
	Engineering design and specifications
	Environmental remedial investigation, design, and implementation (CERCLA) performed within the last 10 years. 

Offerors are restricted to no more than 6 example projects completed within 5 years to the proposed effort.

These reviews must illustrate the scope of each effort; their complexity, how schedules were implemented and how objectives were met (include timetables).  Projects completed for the Federal Government in particular should be included, if any.  The offerors submission will be considered satisfactory upon demonstrating successful completion of at least one project in each of the above areas.  Performance will be evaluated as successful when information submitted by the offeror or from client contact confirms that the projects were effective in meeting the intended primary outcome of the project.  For example, a project intended to achieve permit compliance must demonstrate that compliance was achieved.

2. Past Performance on Similar Contracts-
Past performance shall demonstrate how well the offeror delivers quality services; demonstrates ability to achieve program objectives; meet customer expectations; demonstrates ability to manage and meet priority timelines; demonstrates ability to manage expenses; and demonstrate overall performance on work similar in operational and technical complexity to services described in the SOW. Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each offeror in this volume and data obtained from other available sources in the evaluation of past performance.

Offerors shall provide a narrative for each of the example projects (detailed reviews) provided in Factor 1.  Narratives shall include information on past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work, accuracy of construction cost estimates, and the number, dollar amounts, and reasons for construction change orders. Offerors shall provide at least two points of contacts for each project who can account for the conditions, effort, and complexity comparable to this requirement.  Aspects of the projects submitted for past performance should be relevant to the requirement for this contract and recent (within five years) to the proposed effort.  The offeror shall clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified.  The offerors submission will be considered satisfactory upon demonstrating that each project met the budget, quality and schedule objectives for the project.  Offerors are restricted to no more than 3 pages per narrative for each example project.

Offerors shall complete Section 1 of the attached Past Performance Questionnaire (SIR Attachment 5) and send it along with the Client Authorization Letter (see sample at SIR Attachment 6) to all points of contact (POCs) for the contracts the Offeror identified in its proposal for this factor (a minimum of three, but no more than five for the prime, and maximum of three for each teaming partner/significant subcontractor for contracts completed or underway within the last five years).   The POCs shall be familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature.  The POCs will complete the questionnaires and forward them by email to the Contracting Officer, Kathleen Islas, (Kathleen.d.islas@faa.gov) no later than the SIR closing date.  RESPONDENTS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRES SHALL NOT SEND THE COMPLETED INFORMATION SHEETS BACK TO THE OFFEROR.  The Source Evaluation Team (SET) will conduct follow-up with any POC as necessary.

Organizational Structure Change History  Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between the conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate this relevancy determination, offerors shall include a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of the offerors company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation. Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offeror(s), the "roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts identified, yet general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources.

 3. Professional Qualifications 

 Offeror shall submit a complete resume of the experience of each line and staff executive, supervisor and technical staff member who will be assigned to work the requirements of this contract.  Resumes should include: name, educational background, present position or title, types of experience by years, and any other information in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and administrative or technical competence.  Resumes of key individuals employed by subcontracted firms shall also be included.  For executive/supervisory personnel, a minimum of three years of direct executive/supervisory control of an organization involved in the planning and implementation of complex environmental projects is needed.  The project manager or supervisor must be a registered professional engineer currently registered in the state of Oklahoma or able to obtain such registration within thirty days of contract award.  For technical personnel, a minimum of three years experience in the design and execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.
execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.

4. Capacity to Accomplish the Work Required 

Offeror shall submit a description of the firm's current workload, i.e., total number of on-going projects, their value or fee and their percentage of completion.  In addition, provide examples of completed projects and timetables associated with their completion.  Clearly indicate how the workload of this contract can be accomplished within present resources, or a plan should be submitted which demonstrates growth capability commensurate with workload requirements and the effect of this contract.  Information on teaming or subcontracting that will be done with firms having experience within the locales outside of Oklahoma listed above must be provided.  If offeror does not presently employ sufficient executive/supervisory or technical personnel to meet the requirements, submit a plan for recruitment along with minimum experience levels that are required.  Employment of subcontractors shall be considered recruitment for the purpose of the criterion.  In addition, offeror shall provide a description of its cost accounting and control system.  The offerors submission will be deemed satisfactory upon demonstrating that it is clearly able to manage the anticipated workload of this contract.

5. Geographic Location-

Offeror shall submit their geographic location relative to the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, OK.  

Should subcontracting arrangements be required to perform under the proposed contract, all subcontractors must also complete the SF330, with the prime contractor submitting them as a part of their technical proposal.  

A pre-proposal conference is scheduled to be held on Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. Central (Oklahoma) time.  The conference will be held in the Security Command Center, Room 108.

First Round of Questions and Answers Posted. 

Revision to Announcement 1. 6:00 PM 02/17/2015.

The correct version of the SOW was uploaded. 

The FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center has a requirement for environmental architecture and engineering (A&E) services.  Prospective activities include field investigations, production of plans, specifications, studies, calculations, estimates, laboratory analyses, preparation of worker health and safety, sampling and other plans, field sampling (including groundwater, soil, sediment, surface water and air), and detailed counter-measure plans; noise evaluations; industrial waste water pretreatment; air quality (including indoor air quality; environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental due diligence audits (EDDAs); hazardous material storage and handling; groundwater assessments; SARA Title III program; PCB abatement; pollution prevention opportunity assessment, and fuel storage tank management. (See attached Statement of Work.)

PLEASE NOTE THE ORIGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER OF THIS SOLICITION WAS DTFAAC-14-R-04721 AND IT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO DTFAAC-15-R-02523.

It is anticipated than an Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract, with fixed labor hour provisions, will be awarded covering these environmental A&E services.  Requirements are estimated at $960,000 per year.  The resultant contract will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size effort applicable to this requirement:
NAICS:  541620 Environmental Consulting Services
Size Standard:  $15.0 Million

This acquisition is an A&E procurement that is obliged to comply with The Brooks Act (40 USC 1101).  The award process involves the evaluation of architectural and engineering services on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the type of professional services required at fair and reasonable prices.  The evaluation process will not take price into consideration until the most technically qualified and competent firm is selected.

A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).

	Environmental remedial investigation, design, and implementation (CERCLA) performed within the last 10 years. 

Offerors are restricted to no more than 6 example projects completed within 5 years to the proposed effort.

These reviews must illustrate the scope of each effort; their complexity, how schedules were implemented and how objectives were met (include timetables).  Projects completed for the Federal Government in particular should be included, if any.  The offerors submission will be considered satisfactory upon demonstrating successful completion of at least one project in each of the above areas.  Performance will be evaluated as successful when information submitted by the offeror or from client contact confirms that the projects were effective in meeting the intended primary outcome of the project.  For example, a project intended to achieve permit compliance must demonstrate that compliance was achieved.

2. Past Performance on Similar Contracts-
Past performance shall demonstrate how well the offeror delivers quality services; demonstrates ability to achieve program objectives; meet customer expectations; demonstrates ability to manage and meet priority timelines; demonstrates ability to manage expenses; and demonstrate overall performance on work similar in operational and technical complexity to services described in the SOW. Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each offeror in this volume and data obtained from other available sources in the evaluation of past performance.

Offerors shall provide a narrative for each of the example projects (detailed reviews) provided in Factor 1.  Narratives shall include information on past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work, accuracy of construction cost estimates, and the number, dollar amounts, and reasons for construction change orders. Offerors shall provide at least two points of contacts for each project who can account for the conditions, effort, and complexity comparable to this requirement.  Aspects of the projects submitted for past performance should be relevant to the requirement for this contract and recent (within five years) to the proposed effort.  The offeror shall clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified.  The offerors submission will be considered satisfactory upon demonstrating that each project met the budget, quality and schedule objectives for the project.  Offerors are restricted to no more than 3 pages per narrative for each example project.

Offerors shall complete Section 1 of the attached Past Performance Questionnaire (SIR Attachment 5) and send it along with the Client Authorization Letter (see sample at SIR Attachment 6) to all points of contact (POCs) for the contracts the Offeror identified in its proposal for this factor (a minimum of three, but no more than five for the prime, and maximum of three for each teaming partner/significant subcontractor for contracts completed or underway within the last five years).   The POCs shall be familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature.  The POCs will complete the questionnaires and forward them by email to the Contracting Officer, Kathleen Islas, (Kathleen.d.islas@faa.gov) no later than the SIR closing date.  RESPONDENTS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRES SHALL NOT SEND THE COMPLETED INFORMATION SHEETS BACK TO THE OFFEROR.  The Source Evaluation Team (SET) will conduct follow-up with any POC as necessary.

Organizational Structure Change History  Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between the conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate this relevancy determination, offerors shall include a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of the offerors company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation. Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offeror(s), the "roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts identified, yet general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources.

 3. Professional Qualifications 

 Offeror shall submit a complete resume of the experience of each line and staff executive, supervisor and technical staff member who will be assigned to work the requirements of this contract.  Resumes should include: name, educational background, present position or title, types of experience by years, and any other information in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and administrative or technical competence.  Resumes of key individuals employed by subcontracted firms shall also be included.  For executive/supervisory personnel, a minimum of three years of direct executive/supervisory control of an organization involved in the planning and implementation of complex environmental projects is needed.  The project manager or supervisor must be a registered professional engineer currently registered in the state of Oklahoma or able to obtain such registration within thirty days of contract award.  For technical personnel, a minimum of three years experience in the design and execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.
execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.

4. Capacity to Accomplish the Work Required 

Offeror shall submit a description of the firm's current workload, i.e., total number of on-going projects, their value or fee and their percentage of completion.  In addition, provide examples of completed projects and timetables associated with their completion.  Clearly indicate how the workload of this contract can be accomplished within present resources, or a plan should be submitted which demonstrates growth capability commensurate with workload requirements and the effect of this contract.  Information on teaming or subcontracting that will be done with firms having experience within the locales outside of Oklahoma listed above must be provided.  If offeror does not presently employ sufficient executive/supervisory or technical personnel to meet the requirements, submit a plan for recruitment along with minimum experience levels that are required.  Employment of subcontractors shall be considered recruitment for the purpose of the criterion.  In addition, offeror shall provide a description of its cost accounting and control system.  The offerors submission will be deemed satisfactory upon demonstrating that it is clearly able to manage the anticipated workload of this contract.

5. Geographic Location-

Offeror shall submit their geographic location relative to the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, OK.  

Should subcontracting arrangements be required to perform under the proposed contract, all subcontractors must also complete the SF330, with the prime contractor submitting them as a part of their technical proposal.

<DESC>The above numbered solicitation is amended as set forth below. The hour and date specified for receipt of offers is NOT extended. All other terms and conditions of the Request for Proposals (RFP) remain unchanged.
<p><br />PURPOSE OF AMENDMENT: To answer additional questions related to the Solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Question 1. Is the ISO 17025 a minimum requirement or an exact requirement for this SBIR? &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Answer 1.&nbsp;If you are referring to  the difference between ISO 9001:2008 and the ISO 17025 requirement mentioned in the SBIR solicitation, and whether compliance with ISO 9001:2008 is sufficient, It is our understanding that ISO 17025 goes much further than ISO 9001:2008 in ensuring the quality of a laboratory's work.  Therefore, having ISO 9001:2008 is not sufficient to meet the standards of ISO 17025.</p>

<DESC>The goal of Pakistan Regional Economic Integration Activity (PREIA) is to increase access to international markets in order to enhance Pakistan's regional economic integration with its neighbors. By strengthening public and private sector capacities to implement trade policy reform and improving trade promotion and facilitation, PREIA aims to improve the trade environment, resulting in increased regional trade and transit flows. The new Activity has four planned focus areas: (i) improving the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) ability to develop and implement reforms to policies which affect trade;(ii) strengthening private sector and civil society's engagement in trade policy-making and its reform; (iii) improving regional trade and transit facilitation by Pakistan Customs; and (iv) improving regional business to business linkages. <br /><br />The first two areas support broad improvements to the business enabling environment in Pakistan regarding trade, and the others support improved capacity for Pakistani businesses to access regional markets. Trade associations, logistics firms, business associations, GOP ministries and regional counter-parts will increase access to markets through the negotiation and implementation of treaties and trade facilitation measures. As a result of assistance provided through PREIA, Pakistan will have improved capacity in the analysis of trade policy choices, and the private sector will be recognized as a key stakeholder in both policy making and implementation, with the ultimate aim of creating jobs and raising incomes.<br />

ARROYO GRANDE CA 93420-5013
<DESC>This project is DesignBuild and requires stamped and signed drawings by licensed Professional
Engineers. The design build contractor shall convert an existing weight room, storage, and locker room
into a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF) rated AEGIS simulator space. This new,
approximately 1260 square foot space will be designed to house several new government provided
server racks and servers, as well as operator consoles and displays for real time world training. This work
entails providing a room designed to the IC Tech Specfor ICD/ICS 705 for SCIF/ENCLAVE
specifications. All design and construction shall be completed prior to the AEGIS equipment installation
team arriving on site.
 The government installation team will then provide and populate all equipment and
the inner wiring connections within the space constructed by the design build contractor. The equipment
space proposed requires multiple engineering disciplines with an emphasis on, but not limited to
Architectural, Electrical, Fire Protection and Suppression, and Mechanical features. Some limited
structural determinations shall be required during design and coordination.
A new raised floor system shall be required to elevate the new consoles and server equipment for ease of
routing electrical branch circuits, server backbone cabling, and horizontal communications under floor
within the room layout. A single in/out demark electrical penetration chase is proposed for all conduits;
raceway or utilities required leaving the SCIF space.
 Additionally, one section of the remodel requires
the ceiling to be vaulted and raised to meet the (4) large screen display viewing requirement from all angles of the room, and over all the consoles while seated. Preliminary site investigation was completed
with the belief that raising the ceiling is possible.

<DESC>This project consists of maintenance dredging of shoal material at two different locations; Kings Bay U.S. Navy Submarine Base - Inner Channel (KBIC) and Marine Corps Terminal (MCT) within the Marine Corps Facility on Blount Island (USMC-BI).  The straight line distance between the two areas is approximately 28 miles and a waterway distance is approximately 45 nautical miles.  The work is divided into a Base and six options. The first order of work for the Base is the KBIC Site Six Operating Area - South and the second order of work is MCT.  All options pertain to KBIC. The base involves maintenance dredging of approximately 70,000 cubic yards at Site Six South with 45-foot required depth and approximately 205,000 cubic yards from Marine Corps Terminal at Blount Island Station 00+00 to Station 56+09.1 with 38-foot required depth.  The dredged material will be placed in Disposal Mainside (D/A-M) and Dayson Island DMMA (D/A-D) respectively.
