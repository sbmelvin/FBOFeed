The firm must be able to attend working conferences and meetings at DOT headquarters in Washington, D.C. on short notice as well as participate in telephone conference calls on short notice.

<CONTACT>Peggy Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 432-0894, Fax (703) 784-3178, Email SmithP@jnlwd.usmc.mil
<DESC>OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) is soliciting proposals for research, development, integration, and demonstration of next-generation non-lethal weapons (NLW) and capabilities.  The  objective of this BAA is to stimulate applied research, development, and rapid-prototyping of a wide-spectrum of NLW technologies in an attempt to address known NLW technology gaps, to include:

·	Human effects of non-lethal directed energy exposures, to include physiological and behavioral responses.  (examples include high power microwaves (HPM), pulsed and continuous radiofrequency radiation (RFR), laser radiation, and laser induced plasma stimuli) 
·	Emerging  Directed Energy Weapons (DEW)  that have non-lethal applications – specifically counter-personnel, counter-material, and counter-capability missions (example include novel HPM, RFR, laser, and laser induced plasma sources)
·	Advanced  Materials that either provide or enhance non-lethal capabilities (examples include advanced anti-traction materials; engine suffocates, electrical and mechanical foulers, malodorants, thermobarics, NL nanoparticles; rigid foams/materials, morphing materials, and  NL payload delivery systems or payloads for long range remote engagement; and other NL reactants)
·	Human effects relating percussive and continuous sounds, incoherent light sources, and overpressures that alone or in combination would provide operational capabilities while minimizing adverse health effects (examples include exposure-response relationships resulting in glare and flashblindess, or behavioral responses resulting from aversive sounds.)  Also includes establishing either safety thresholds or probability relationship for adverse health effects for these stimuli.  
·	Development of long-range acoustic and ocular  technologies and devices that support operational requirements while minimizing adverse health consequences. 
·	Development of long-range, extended duration, wireless electro-muscular incapacitation technologies or devices (include characterization of  human effect and safety issues, miniaturization and advanced technology issues, and precision targeting) 
·	General science and technology efforts to explore new NLW technologies and payloads
·	Studies/Analyses to address technology-specific legal/treaty/public acceptability issues associated with: (1) extended duration incapacitation; (2) long-range precision engagement of threat weapon systems (counter-material); and (3) precision long-range engagement of threats (combatants vs   operating in complicated operational environments such as within crowds,  
·	Studies/Analyses to identify and research repeatable, universal, & effective technologies to stop vehicles/vessels at a distance and extended duration incapacitation of humans.  
·	Development of compact millimeter-wave (MMW) and HPM NLWs; (for example, portable active denial systems (PADS) and small remotely or hand-delivered high power microwave electronic attack systems for counter-material mission and with minimal collateral damage to adjacent electronic systems or critical infrastructures.
·	Investigations into the human behavioral and psychological  responses to new NLW stimuli.

This applied research and development effort will involve scientific investigations and studies to advance the current state of the art for  NL technologies and capabilities.  Strategically, this research will enable and expedite development of a family of next-generation NLWs to meet a broad set of documented NLW requirements and mission needs.  
PROGRAM SCOPE: The scope of this program is intentionally broad to address the wide spectrum of desired operational end-points that the funded investigations will strategically support.  Both applied and basic research in a wide spectrum of counter-personnel and counter-material technology areas is intended.  All research is intended to have the common objective of addressing the technology-gaps described above.  Strategically, this research will support the development of a family of next-generation NLWs to meet a broad set of documented NLW requirements and mission needs.  In addition to the data and technological gaps identified above, research support by this BAA is intended to enable NL capabilities that overcome the current limitations of existing NL systems.  These limitations include:

·	Limits of range, accuracy and precision
·	Limits in the effectiveness, and abilities to quantify effectiveness
·	Limits in providing a universal, repeatable, robust NL effect
·	Limits in target safety, particularly across a wide-spectrum of the population
·	Limits in deployability, to include weight and volume
·	Limits in employability, to include use in complex urban environments 
EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria in descending order of importance: (1) Quality and Technical Merit, (2) Contributions/Relevance to JNLWD and DoD, (3) Capabilities and Experience, (4) Plans and Capabilities to Accomplish Technology Transfer, and (5) Total Cost and Cost Realism. All awards made in response to this BAA will be subject to availability of government funds. Evaluations and selection or non-selection of proposals for funding will be made on the basis of the evaluation criteria listed and the overall balance considered most advantageous to the JNLWP. 
GENERAL INFORMATION: JNLWD has budgeted approximately $8.2 million for FY05, $8.4 million for FY06, $7.4 million for FY07, $16.8M for FY08 and $16.8 million for FY09. Multiple awards typically of 12-36 month duration are anticipated. Offerors should prepare proposals with a baseline period of performance of 12 months and with one or two options each with a 12-month period of performance, and with anticipated contract award dates in March 2005. This BAA will remain open for a period of one until (14 November 2005). The 5-page pre-proposals are due on or before 4:00 PM (EST), December 31, 2004, in order to be considered for FY05 funding.  The pre-proposals shall be evaluated and offerors shall be invited to re-submit formal full proposals on or before 4:00 PM (EST), 11 January, 2005 in order to be considered for FY05 funding.  Offerors must submit a 5-page original pre-proposal and six (6) copies of proposals to the administrative address for this BAA.  Invited full proposals shall follow this same process.   It is the policy of the JNLWD to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. The Government may use selected support contractor personnel from American Systems Corporation and M2 Technologies as special resources to assist in administering the evaluation of the proposals. These persons are restricted by their contracts from disclosing the proposal information or using it for other than performing the administrative task. Contractor personnel are required to sign non-disclosure statements. By submission of your proposal, you agree that your proposal information may be disclosed to those selected contractors for the limited purpose stated above.
Only Government evaluators will make selections under this BAA. This announcement, in conjunction with the pamphlet BAA M67854-05-R-5009 Proposer Information Package (PIP), constitutes the Broad Area Announcement as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). Addresses for obtaining the PIP are provided at the end of this notice. A formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. In addition, the Government reserves the right to award either contracts, grants, or other instruments determined to be of benefit to the government in achieving the goals of this program. Awards are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any other JNLWD and/or Marine Corps contracts through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number. Affirmation shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission. All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in the FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any pre-proposal or proposal preparation costs. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit proposals, which will be evaluated. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research related to Non-Lethal Weapons developments.

<RESPDATE>121504
<ARCHDATE>12302004
<CONTACT>Svetlana Podeyko, Acquisition Specialist, Phone 011-380-44-462-5678, Fax 011-380-44-462-5834, Email spodeyko@usaid.gov
<DESC>USAID/Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova anticipate an award of a five-year, performance based contract to support Financial Sector/Pension System Development (FD/PSD) in Ukraine.  The procurement will be through full and open competition.   

The purpose of USAID/Ukraine's Financial Sector/Pension System Development Project (FS/PSD) is to create a viable, effective financial sector which will promote economic growth and provide a sound private pension system. 

The development of a viable, effective, financial sector will provide small and medium enterprises with access to financing to through the capital markets. In addition, USAID’s experience has demonstrated that when commercial banks realize that small and medium sized enterprises are obtaining credit through the capital markets, it can stimulate a competitive response which generates increased commercial bank lending to SMEs.

The development of a viable, effective, financial sector is also critical to the successful implementation of Ukraine’s mandatory, defined-contribution, private accumulation pension system.  This second pillar pension system which is scheduled to go into effect in January 2007 requires that all employees contribute 7% of their salaries the private accumulation pension system.  This will total a minimum of over $ 1 billion in contributions per year.  Properly invested, these funds can become a major engine of economic growth. However, Ukraine’s nascent financial sector is completely inadequate to accommodate the investment of such sums of money.  It is essential and urgent that the challenges of developing a financial market be met in order to protect the pension contributions of Ukraine’s labor force and to guarantee retirement payments to the country’s current and future pensioners.

The challenges to financial sector development in Ukraine include:

Prudential regulation and oversight, particularly in securities market and other non-bank financial markets, do not protect the public, nor stimulate the growth of financial markets.

Financial statements are not a reliable indicator of company financial performance and condition, and the public generally does not have access to accurate, understandable information on financial intermediaries

The capital markets infrastructure remains shallow, with inadequate non-bank financial institutions and instruments, insurance products, equity and debt markets, money market funds, corporate and municipal bonds.

The anticipated contributions to the Second Pillar pension system will quickly exceed domestic investment opportunities, which could result in a concentration in government securities, which will not fuel economic growth, or in sub-standard, high risk domestic corporate stocks and bonds.

Lack of progress in meeting these challenges can be attributed primarily to a lack of a modern joint-stock company law which incorporates the OECD principles of corporate governance which protect investors, and weak, inefficient financial market regulators.

To meet the challenges, the FS/PSD has set the following objectives: 

Strengthen the capacities of the financial markets regulators to provide efficient and effective prudential regulation to the NBFI sector.

Broaden the range of financial instruments available for portfolio investment.

Strengthen the capacity of the pension system to enhance the operational capabilities of the pension fund providers, regulators, supervisors, and policy makers.

USAID anticipates awarding one (1) contract, The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541611. The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov) on or around December 15, 2004. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no solicitation will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. Questions must be directed to Raymond Jennings until December 3, 2004, and beginning December 6, 2004 to Svetlana Podeyko.

<DESC>This effort involves the assimilation of software code for a Flight Operations and Analysis (FOA) capability for the Western Range Operations Control Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base and the assimilation of software code for a Meteorological and Range Safety Support (MARSS) system for the Eastern and Western spacelift ranges.  The FOA system is a range flight safety system.  The MARSS system calculates all the toxic and hazard models for weather forecasting.  Once the software code for these product items is assimilated, the software must be successfully tested in a Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI) Qualification Test (QT), henceforth referred to as CQT.  Successful completion of CQT involves preparatory analysis, completion of Unit Testing, Unit Integration Test, completion of software peer reviews, completion of CQT itself, completion of post-CQT analysis, completion of installation and checkout on the range, and associated integrated logistics support activities.  In general, these activities must be done for both the FOA and MARSS systems. Required completion date of all activities is April 2005. Estimated budget for these activities is $3.7 million.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Solicitation is modified to include the following information:
1. Goals of the solution - Provide natural language query for information either directly input or knowledge gained from trouble tickets submitted via Remedy. Provide accuracy of answer for query submitted and template to request additional information when required.
2. Its Purpose: Provide a knowledge management solution for a trouble ticket management system.
3. What problems are solved: Provide "self-help" solutions for users; repository of information; process to gain additional information when not found via natural language query.
4. Which Systems Will Be Accessed: Must integrate with Remedy; using Oracle database.






NCTAMS LANT NORFOLK, VIRGINIA REQUESTS INTERESTED SOFTWARE 
SUPPLIERS TO PRESENT THEIR SOFTWARE PRESENTATIONS WHICH WILL SATISFY THE BELOW REQUIREMENTS. A TENTATIVE MEETING WILL BE HELD 7 AND 8 DECEMBER 2004 AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE TWO DAYS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PRESENTING SOFTWARE PACKAGES TO THE PERTINENT COMMAND PERSONNEL. ALL INTERESTED PARTIES SHALL CONTACT L. MATHEWS 757-445-9704 OR BY EMAIL AT MATHEWSL@NCTAMSLANT.NAVY.MIL TO SCHEDULE A TIME DURING THE TWO DAY PERIOD FOR YOUR PRESENTATION.   THE FOLLOWING SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET.

1. Commercially available software that meets or exceeds industry standard for best practices in 'intelligent' management of information contained within a specified enterprise network. This software package should contain a certification that stipulates safeguards against reverse engineering, "back doors" and Trojan coding.

2. The software must be able to directly interface an Oracle database (as a user) for the purpose of retrieving archival information within tables and using that information to present responses to queries. Notionally, the software will retrieve information contained in the database, and apply user defined algorithms that sort the information on an ad hoc basis, or as part of a predefined metric-gathering script.

3. In concert with Oracle, the software must be compatible with ARSystem 5.x/6.x for the purpose of selecting/sorting fields on forms specific to the query operation and using the result within pre-canned and ad hoc reporting tools.

4. The software must contain a web site search feature allowing users to search specific data strings for resultant html pages offering the string variable, as well as documents (.doc; .xls; .mpp; et al) that contain the string variable. The results should hyperlink the location within the website for user 'one-click' access to the information.

5. The software should contain an algorithm (proprietary or configurable) that "learns" from input provided by the user concerning applicability of the resultant query lists. As users indicate satisfaction with a particular document/solution presented in response to their query, the algorithm 'weights' the document/solution to be presented higher in the list order for exact or similar queries presented by other users.

6. The software should enable Natural Language Query (NLQ), precluding the necessity of users to learn a specific query language in order to obtain query results. This requirement is not contradictory to other forms of user input, such as radio-button selections or list drop downs, neither of which require the user to learn a specific query language.

7. The software must be warranted by the manufacturer to perform as advertised, and must be supported by technical support that responds within a reasonable timeframe to configuration issues or trouble reports.

8. The software should incorporate new documents/html "on the fly" without administrator intervention and place them appropriately within the directory's algorithm. Similarly, the software should remove from its algorithm documents/html that have been removed by the administrators.

9. The software should incorporate time-configurable document 'aging' that alerts the administrator to documents or html that have exceeded the threshold for relevant information.

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and development for innovative concepts and techniques for Cross-Platform SIGINT Fusion and Correlation. 

The Air Force Research Laboratory Fusion Technology Branch has developed an open, distributed, object-oriented architecture called the Extensible Data Architecture (XDA) for information fusion under the Adaptive Sensor Fusion (ASF) program. This program included support for multiple interoperable fusion components and a public Application Programmer's Interface (API) that is suitable for inserting new fusion components into the system. Fusion component interoperability is based on a shared description of the battlespace and shared data exchange and persistence mechanisms. Through the implementation of a common interface and a common battlespace ontology, new and legacy fusion engines and capabilities can be encapsulated and become interoperable components within a common architecture. Given this stable environment for test and development, the performance of legacy and new fusion engines can be rapidly inserted, evaluated and consistently quantified.

The NSA sponsored Advanced Fusion Workstation (AFWS) developed by AFRL is a government owned and extensible information fusion system built upon the XDA/ASF core services.  In it’s present instantiation it is focused on solving the SIGINT fusion problem set.  The extensible nature of the system however, allows it to easily accommodate multiple sensing modalities, and data sources.  One of the major goals of the AFWS is to accommodate inferential reasoning to achieve JDL level II and III fusion.  In the present configuration the system utilizes the K-PASA template based reasoning services of WebTAS.  Ongoing work is incorporating automated reasoners using a Bayesian approach and Demptser Shaefer reasoning capabilities.  The basic premise is to transition from semi, to fully automated inferential reasoning, as the underlying science of the fusion components support such transitions.

The scope of this announcement is to acquire necessary technologies and their integration into the IFEA Advanced Fusion Workstation XDA-based architecture.  

Specific goals and capabilities include but are not limited to: 
AOI Monitor – Provides an operator defined area of interest, within which he/she can define a set of rules to be applied to multi-INT streaming data.  When the real time state occurs the operator is notified. (JDL Level II).

Inferential Reasoning Component – Component to provide semi-automated JDL level II fusion.  This component will instantiate multiple reasoning methods that include: A) Operators codified knowledge of patterns of activity based upon a-priori knowledge.  As various states of the activity models are satisfied, operators are notified that predetermined activities are likely occurring.  B)  Automated inferential reasoning system that may provide SCI level identification of elements in the battlespace, as well as their interaction with one another.  This level of interaction may allow the system to infer intent of entities. C)  Bayesian based automated inferential reasoning approach to solve more complex entity interrelationships problems in the data (JDL Level II and perhaps III).

MTI and ELINT Fusion – An MTI to ELINT fusion component should combine the precise geo-location characteristics provided by MTI with precise identity provided by ELINT. (JDL Level I).

Emitter Mapping – This service will monitor comms external data and reconstruct C2 and other nodal associations between actors in the battlespace.  The ability to map specific clusters of particular types of comms nodes on the battlefield, will provide the capability to assess force strength, and disposition, as well as potentially identity. (JDL Level I).

Automated Creation of Standard Knowledge Bases – Through extension of existing knowledge bases this component will provide a single and coherent source of a-priori knowledge against which other components can reason.  This service will integrate elements of the EIPB output in XML format.

Standard I/O methods – Leveraging existing gateways to data sources such as TDDS and TDIMF as well as streaming MTI data.
Background Acoustics – Existing background acoustics technology will be integrated into XDA.

Speaker ID – Existing speaker ID technology will be integrated into XDA.

Imagery and ELINT –  Information obtained from available satellite and airborne imagery can be combined with SIGINT information to increase identification accuracy and provide precise target location information needed for targeting. Fusion of SIGINT, IMINT, and other sources is required for hard-to-find targets

Ontology Development – Definition and development of standard SIGINT ontology, extension of visualization ontology, and definition of multi-INT ontologies.

CONOPS Development – A CONOPS document will be developed for Single Platform, Cross Platform, and AOC/DCGS Fusion Systems.

ISR Management – Address the resource management, tasking and re-tasking of multiple, network centric sensors to perform SIGINT correlation and fusion to derive situation assessment in support of military operations.

The overall objective of this PRDA is to develop, integrate, demonstrate and transition system technologies.  This program will employ and exploit existing technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a roadmap of continued spiral development. In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complementary activities including, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, data collection and management, and a distributed collaborative engineering environment. 

The developed system will be transitionable to Rivet Joint, Senior Scout, C2C, National Systems, the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) and/or as applicable, the Air Force Transformation Center. 

The AFRL, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL/IFE) is soliciting proposals to develop an open, government owned, Multi-INT fusion capability using ASF/AFWS Core Services Framework. Potential Offerors should have considerable experience and expertise in the following areas:  1)  Insertion of new and legacy fusion components and technologies into the ASF/XDA. 2)  Development of  interfaces, algorithms and databases, coordinate software development and integration of fusion modules; and integrate multiple-sources of sensor and intelligence reports. 3)  Recent operational experience on Rivet Joint, and in the AF DCGS and AF AOC. 4) SIGINT Domain Expertise. 5) ISR Management 6) SEI Level 2 Software Development 7) Risk Management 8) Program Management 9) Multi-INT Scenario Development and Modeling.

The program schedule should contain spiral developments and deliveries. 

The fusion system shall be designed to process, fuse and display the following types of information, as a minimum: Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications (COMINT), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI), and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT).  The design of the system shall not preclude the potential ingestion of other intelligence data, for example, Video, EO/IR, MSI/HSI, MASINT (seismic, acoustic, magnetic), HUMINT. 

Program reviews shall be conducted to track technical, financial and schedule performance and risk. 

Capability is sought that can be fully developed and transitioned to operational units as rapidly as possible. Since many applicable technologies exist today, offerors are encouraged to leverage technology from these other programs, as applicable. It is anticipated that offerors will investigate, apply, exploit and modify existing COTS and GOTS technologies. 

Deliverables will include technical reports, user's manuals, training manuals and delivery and integration of robust software prototypes into the AFRL ELINT Development Facility.  In addition, the level of maturity must be adequate to transition to the user community by integration and demonstrations into the DCGS and/or as applicable, the Air Force Transformation Center.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a two (2) to five (5) page white paper on their proposed research topic to: Air Force Research Laboratory/IFEA, ATTN: Ms. Carolyn Sheaff, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B:  Task Objective; and Section C:  Technical Summary.    Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. 

This PRDA is accepting white papers until 1 Oct 2008.  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award, FY 05 should be submitted by 1 May 04; FY 06 by 1 May 05; FY 07 by 1 May 06; and FY 08 by 1 May 07. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.

Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria:(l) Overall scientific and technical merit, including the rationale and approach for the proposed technology development, (2) Potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) Soundness of proposed technology transition approach, and (4)  Offerors demonstrated capability to successfully integrate various technologies.  .Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this PRDA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this PRDA.   All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal which shall be considered. Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. 

Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $200,000 to $1,000,000 per fiscal year.  Total funding for this PRDA is anticipated to be $24 M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this PRDA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:  FY04: $5M;  FY05: $5M;  FY06: $5M;  FY07: $5M;  FY08: $4M.

Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the TOP SECRET SCI level, therefore, personnel identified for assignment to those proposed efforts must be already cleared for access to TOP SECRET SCI information. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this PRDA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Allied foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.

Questions prior to the submission of a proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, Carolyn Sheaff/315-330-7147, Carolyn.Sheaff@rl.af.mil.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition. 

A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.

<DESC>The Office of Administrative Services is responsible for the real property leasing program of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  In 2001 the SEC entered into a lease with Louis Dreyfus Properties, Inc., for a 14 year lease for a property of approximately 707,000 Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) rentable square feet (rsf) to be constructed next to Union Station, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002 (Building One), with occupancy currently scheduled to commence in approximately Spring 2005.  Subsequently, the lease was amended to add another property adjacent to the first at 600 2nd Street, NE, Washington, DC 20002 (Building Two) of approximately 363,000 BOMA rsf for a 14 year term to commence within one year of completion of Building One.  The flat, non-escalating lease rate for each building is $43.63/BOMA rsf full service per year, with adjustments for variations in operating costs and taxes.  All spaces subject to measurement.

In connection with the leases, the Government has the right to purchase either Building One, or Building One and Building Two, by paying a higher lease rate over the lease terms.  The Government is considering transferring these purchase options to a private entity in exchange for considerations in return.

The purchase options are summarized as follows:

SEC has the right to purchase (i) Building One only, or (ii) Building One and Two together.
Purchase options must be executed prior to the Lease Commencement Date (i.e., the occupancy date) for Building One, otherwise the options on both buildings terminate.
Exercise of option on Building Two, if any, must be made at the same time as exercise of option on Building One.
Building One Purchase Options:  SEC exercises option by paying either (i) $67.83 full service rent per BOMA rentable square foot per year for twenty (20) years; (ii) $71.42 full service rent per BOMA rentable square foot per year for fifteen (15) years; or (iii) $72.20 full service rent per BOMA rentable square foot per year for fourteen (14) years.
Building Two Purchase Option.  SEC exercises option by paying $94.00 full service rent per BOMA rentable square foot per year for the fourteen (14) years of Building Two term (i.e., SEC must exercise option by giving Building Two notice at commencement of Building One term, but payment of option rent does not commence until Building Two term commences).  
Under all options, rent is paid in arrears, full service, including all operating expenses and taxes.  Under all options, SEC makes a concluding $10.00 final payment upon expiration of the applicable lease term, upon receipt of which Lessor conveys Building title, free and clear of liens.
In its notice of exercise of its purchase option(s), the SEC must specify which payment plan it elects for Building One (i.e., 14, 15, or 20 years).

Pertinent parts of the leases are available included in Attachment 1 to this sources sought notice.

The SEC anticipates occupying Building One and commencing the lease term in the first quarter of 2005, and Building Two approximately 12 months thereafter, subject to acceptance of space under the terms of the Lease and developments in scheduling.  

 *** DESCRIPTION *** 

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this RFI. No contract action will be issued as a result of this announcement.  All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. 

The Government is considering whether it would be advantageous to the Government to transfer the rights to purchase the building(s) to a private entity, in exchange for value to the Government and/or the Government retaining certain rights in the future.  These future Government retained rights could include a lease back of the Building(s) to the Government at a favorable rate for a succeeding long term lease, a Government right to purchase the Building(s) by a flat payment, a Government right to purchase the Building(s) through a lease to purchase over a long lease term.   The Government may also consider an assignment of both the 14 year leasehold interest and the purchase option interests of the lease, with the SEC becoming a 14 year subtenant to any assignee of the lease, in exchange for value to the Government and/or the Government retaining certain rights in the future.  

The Government would consider other structures that would be favorable to it as well as the above examples.   For example, the purchase options are set at 14, 15 and 20 year payment periods.  The SEC is currently under lease for a 14 year term.  There may be structure scenarios that would include the 15 and 20 year payment periods.

The Government is interested in obtaining responses from entities that would be interested in participating in a competition to acquire the purchase options in exchange for consideration to the Government as outlined above or other consideration. 

Data obtained from this RFI will be used by the Government in making decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement or administrative strategy in connection with the purchase options.  Interested organizations are invited to submit a capability statement to the SEC.  Submitted information should include: 
a) a description of their organization, including relevant experience and history of investing in and managing complex real estate transactions;
b) a description of the structures they would propose to the Government in connection with assumption of the purchase options (e.g., lease back to the Government, sale to the Government through flat purchase, or lease to purchase, or both, or other structure);
c) a description of the proposed pricing formulations they would propose and how these pricing formulations are derived;
d) a statement of their financial capabilities and proposed financing strategy for the structures they propose;
d) additional information or questions that would be helpful in management of these purchase options.

All information submitted to the SEC will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law, including the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 552) and the Trade Secrets Act (18 USC 1905). Information must be submitted by December 3, 2004.

<SUBJECT>R--Advisory and Assistance
<DESC>The Bureau of the Census intends to issue a sole source contract to Charles Lee to provide expert advice and assistance to the Manufacturing and Construction Division (MCD) on the 2002 Economic Census and preparation for the 2007 Economic Census. The MCD collects, processes, analyzes and disseminates basic industry statistics and prepares benchmarks for current business indicators such as the annual survey of manufactures, current industrial reports and, as part of the economic census, the quinquennial census for manufacturing, mining and construction industries.  To assist with its work on the economic census, the MCD requires the consulting services of a person with both industry and economic census expertise who can advise staff on developing requirements by making technical and methodological recommendations, and act as a liaison to the economic planning and coordination division which supports and assists subject matter divisions in conducting the economic census and related surveys. Principal projects to be addressed by this expert’s consultations include system testing, program training, specification review, and assist in the development of various analytical tools.  The nature of some specific tasks may require travel to Jeffersonville, Indiana and other select locations.  Mr. Lee has served as a senior industry specialist in the Census Bureau’s Manufacturing and Construction Division where he played key roles in planning and conducting many quinquennial economic censuses, annual surveys of manufactures and related statistical projects.  Mr. Lee’s experience corresponds closely to the work required under this contract.  This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, responses received within 15 days from the posting of this notice will be reviewed and evaluated.  Interested vendors having the capability to provide the above  services should submit in writing their capability statement with cost information to linda.a.vance@census.gov or fax to 301-457-8465 within 15 days of this notice.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<SUBJECT>A -- Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI)
<DESC>As a result of an unsolicited proposal, The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) contracting activity intends to negotiate and award a contract to the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), a non-profit organization in Washington, DC.  The objective of this proposed worked entitled "Project on Nuclear Issues" (PONI) is to build and sustain a networked community of young nuclear experts from the military, the national laboratories, industry, academia, and the policy community.  PONI activities are designed to engage the next generation of nuclear professionals in debates on nuclear technology, strategy, and policy. The direct products of this effort are papers on nuclear defense matters generated by the Young Nuclear Scholars and for the PONI conferences.  These papers cover subjects such as long term maintenance, modularity, and diversity of the nuclear stockpile; the emerging threats they hold at risk; and the responsive infrastructure needed to maintain nuclear deterrence through 2050.  The effort currently draws from and would contribute to the library of publications that DTRA's Advanced Systems and Concepts Office (ASCO) has sponsored on the Strategic Nuclear Force.  These papers support the R&D work of three divisions within DTRA: ASCO, Combat Support Nuclear Stockpile Division (CSN), and the Nuclear Technology Division (TDN).  DTRA intends to negotiate with CSIS on a sole source basis. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented at FAR Part 6.302-1. Pursuant to 6.302-1(a)(2)(i), CSIS has submitted an unsolicited proposal that demonstrates a unique capability to directly address two critical concerns of DTRA:  (1) maintaining nuclear deterrence and (2) sustaining subject matter experts in nuclear weapon matters. The period of performance of this effort shall be for a one-year base period and one year option.  Vendors qualified to provide the subject services should submit technical evidence of their capabilities and qualifications in writing to the identified point of contact by not later than 4:00 PM, EDT, on December 30th, 2004.   Evidence submitted should clearly demonstrate the vendor's ability to provide the requisite services and the price for doing so.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. No solicitation document exists and requests for such will not be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  As a result of analyzing the responses to this synopsis of intent, the Contracting Officer may determine that a solicitation will be issued, but no additional synopsis will be published.  Any such solicitation will be issued to the intended vendor and all firms that respond to this synopsis of intent and demonstrate their technical capability to provide the required services.  If no responses are received, an award will be made to CSIS.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  POCs Carmen G.

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following four technical factors (with corresponding subfactors) shall be used to evaluate offers: 
1. Staffing Plan 
This factor includes the number of trained persons to be assigned under the contract. 
The plan for replacement and training of staff (i.e., to cope with staff turnover). 
The capacity to provide staff on short notice (i.e., cope with absenteeism). 
The capability of obtaining laboratory tests and or specialized consultation as needed. 
The capability of staff to deal with medical emergencies. 
The capacity to provide initial counseling, diagnoses, and referral in cases of emotional or psychiatric illness, drug dependence, etc. 
2. Management Capability 
This includes the capability to coordinate health services efficiently and effectively. 
Ability to schedule physician’s time for maximum advantage. 
Retention of current Health Unit employees. 
3. Experience/Past Performance 
This factor includes the experience of the Offeror and/or key staff members in an industrial or occupational health environment for other agencies or companies as demonstrated in their resumes and other information. 
Successful delivery of occupational health services to other employing agencies. 
Maintenance of a positive working relationship with those agencies. 
Customer satisfaction with contractor performance.
4. Preventive Health Services 
This factor evaluates the commitment of the Offeror to provide preventive medical screenings. The Government will give credit under this factor to an Offeror who proposes one or more additional medical screening programs, examples provided below, as well as other additional medical screenings or educational programs that the Offeror will conduct if selected as the Contractor: 
Blood profile screening 
Chest X-ray 
Pap Smear 
Mammography 
Technical factors 1, 2, 3, and 4, will be scored 40, 25, 25, and 10, respectively.  The technical factors 1 through 4, above, when combined, are more important than price/cost.  
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
BASIS OF AWARD - Proposals that do not conform to all requirements and/or do not address all the evaluation factors outlined above will be rejected without further consideration.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror who satisfies all requirements and whose proposal is determined to offer the greatest value and most advantage to the Government. The source selection decision shall be based on a comparative assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation.  The award will include the clauses cited at FAR 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items.

BACKGROUND 

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates six HU-25D model aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  The HU-25D uses the Telephonics APS143 Radar System.  These aircraft are used in surveillance missions that are performed mainly over water with aircraft and communication system components being exposed to salt-laden environments.  Line Replaceable Units (LRU’s) contained within each system are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking provides, but is not limited to: an individual LRU historical record of repair and/or overhaul; tracking of component time (time since new (TSN)/time in service (TIS), time since overhaul (TSO), and mean time between failure (MTBF); component status; and physical location.

OBJECTIVE

The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center, or equivalent, to effectively repair/overhaul and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 LRU’s.  Repaired/overhauled LRU’s must meet the OEM current specifications and must perform at the system level.  Each LRU when installed shall be required to operate/interact with the other LRU’s within the Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) and Over the Horizon Airborne Sensor Information System (OASIS) without need of adjustment or degradation of system operation.  The system is also comprised of many subcomponents that provide video and power distribution to operate these LRU’s. 

The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to: trained personnel, required tooling, calibrated test equipment, FAA and/or OEM approved replacement parts, publications and documents pertaining to the LRU, preservation and shipping.

The offeror’s responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work.

Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center’s (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the chosen offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  

To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives, the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 

1.	Technical:

a.	Provide detailed work specifications for baseline repair of LRU’s.

b.	Provide a written Performance Metrics plan.  

c.	Provide evidence of an ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.

d.	Possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, and fixtures  to meet the OEM current specifications.

e.	Provide an incentive proposal. 

f.	Provide repercussions for failure to meet Turn-Around-Time (TAT).

2.	Past Performance:
a.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like 
	items.

b.	Provide points of contact for past performance documentation for the past two years.  Include reference’s name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.

3.	Pricing:

Provide a firm-fixed price for repair of the part numbers listed above for ALL years including both Level I and Level II Repairs.

4.	Definitions:

a.	Turn around Time (TAT):  Turn around time is defined as the time item is received at vendor’s facility until item is returned to ARSC or designated Air Station.

b.	Premature Failures:  Premature failures are identified as those failures which occur during testing prior to installation or within the first 250 hours of operation.  Note:  Premature failures found to be “No Fault Found” will not be considered in the premature failure penalty clause.

c.	Level I Repair:  Test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements.

d.	Level II Repair:  Over and above a Level I Repair for units showing excessive degradation.

APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 

The following Technical Specifications are applicable:

	1.  OEM current repair and maintenance support documentation. 

	2.  OEM Service Bulletins (SB-)

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

<DESC>*****Solicitation Number SB1341-05-Q-0102 is hereby amended in order to respond to technical questions from vendors and change the due date for quotations.  QUESTION 1:  Items 1 through 3 all state ...must deliver greater than 2601... What does this mean?  RESPONSE:  Items 1 through 3 should be read as 260 l, as in 260 liters.  QUESTION 2:  Cylinder sizes are not stated, but due to mixes and ppm levels Aluminum cylinders will be used for stability.  Are there cubic foot requirements for the cylinders?  RESPONSE:  Cylinder sizes are not stated because for some of these mixtures, pressure limitations will require larger cylinders. The request was written in such a way so as to get what we asked for, that is, 260 liters of the mixtures in question delivered at a pressure in excess of 30 psig. Strictly speaking, the size of the cylinder is not the issue, whereas the delivered volume and pressure very much are of concern.  QUESTION 3:   Item 4 asks for 3000cuft.   A typical cylinder for this is 144cuft.   RESPONSE:  3000 cu. ft. is the total volume required.  The requirement is for ten cylinders (10 cylinders at 300 cubic ft., which equals 3000 cubic ft., NIST is not looking just for one cylinder to carry 3000 cubic ft.  QUESTION 4:  Item 4 also asks for Total Volatile Organic Compounds be less than 0.1 ppm. What are the VOC's in question?  When we do analysis for VOC's they are typically customer selected components.   RESPONSE:  Hydrocarbon-free air, THC less than 0.1 ppm as CH4 (methane), CO less than 0.5 ppm, CO2 less than 1 ppm, oxygen as in air (20 plus or minus1 percent).  The due date for quotations is hereby changed FROM: Tuesday, November 16, 2004, TO: THURSDAY, November 18, 2004.at 3:00 pm EST.  EMAILED QUOTATIONS SHALL BE ACCEPTED AS LONG AS THEY ARE RECEIVED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BY THE 3:00 PM EST DEADLINE.  QUOTATIONS RECEIVED AFTER THE DEADLINE SHALL BE DEEMED LATE AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.  FAXED QUOTATIONS SHALL NOT BE ACCEPTED. *****

<DESC>1.  THE FOLLOWING ARE RESPONSES TO CONTRACTOR SUBMITTED QUESTIONS:

QUESTION 1:  What are the variances (= or -) allowed on the inside dimensions of these crates?
ANSWER 1:  Inside dimensions 90 Inch Length x 36 1/2 Inch Width X 24 Inch Depth. No variation

QUESTION 2:  Hasn't Specification PPP-B-601 been cancelled and superceded by ASTM D6251?
ANSWER 2:  Per our packing specialist: It is the same only it is commercial they still have to meet the same specs.

QUESTION 3:  It appears that the sides sit on the runners and are attached to the runners. This would require the cleats on the sides to project past the plywood on the sides by the thickness of the plywood (3/8"). Is this correct?
ANSWER 3:  Yes

QUESTION 4:  How are the ends attached to the bottom? I can see that they are naiad to the sides through the cleats, but the drawing implies that the cleat on the end projects past the plywood on the end by the thickness of the bottom plywood (3/8") and nailed into the bottom. This doesn't seems right.
ANSWER 4:  YES

QUESTION 5:  Questions 3 and 4 stem from my concern about assembly problems and unit integrity. The way this is drawn does not lend itself to ease (or safe) of construction or a very strong box. The solution to these assembly problems is to: 
     A.  Draw the box so that the plywood on the bottom is the width and length of the outside dimension of the box. Make the crate so the inside dimensions are the same as question # 1.
ANSWER 5A:  Yes
     B.  Assemble by nailing the sides to the ends?
ANSWER 5B:  YES
     C.  Place the bottom -upside down- on the assembled sides and ends and nail it to them?
ANSWER 5C: YES
     D.  Flip the unit over and attach the top?
ANSWER 5D: YES
     E.  Is this drawing a general guideline and the overall concern is that the inside dimension be correct' leaving the actual construction details to the contractor?
ANSWER 5E:  Yes. The answer to all questions is YES. Our concern is that the inside dimension are correct (no variation) and that we can put the pieces together when they get here. The creates need to be sound, solid enough to carry the load we described in the first set of questions. (650lbs).


2.  In the original "Combined Synopsis/Solitation" under what shall be included with quotes, number (7) is revised to read as follows:

(7) Completed copy of the Representations and Certifications at FAR 52.212-3 and DFARS 252.212-7000.
