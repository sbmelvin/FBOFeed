<DESC>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) invites proposals for basic research in support of the Air Force Defense Research Sciences Program. This program is described in the document entitled Research Interests and Broad Agency Announcement 2004-1. This document will guide proposers through AFOSR's research program and facilitate their preparation of research proposals. It is available on the AFOSR web site at http://www.afosr.af.mil/. A very limited number of hard copies will be available for individuals without access to the AFOSR web site. To request a hard copy, contact AFOSR/PKC at pkcontracting@afosr.af.mil. The general areas of interest are: (1) Aerospace and Materials Sciences; e.g., structural mechanics; mechanics of materials and devices; unsteady aerodynamics and hypersonics; turbulence and rotating flows; combustion and diagnostics; space power and propulsion; metallic materials; ceramics and nonmetallic materials; organic matrix composites. (2) Physics and Electronics; e.g., plasma physics; space electronics; atomic and molecular physics; remote sensing and Imaging; optoelectronics; laser and optical physics; quantum electronic solids; semiconductor materials; sensors in the space environment; high density optical memory. (3) Chemistry and Life Sciences; e.g., polymer chemistry; surface and interfacial science; theoretical chemistry; molecular dynamics; chronobiology; biomimetics, biomaterials, and biointerfacial sciences; perception and cognition; sensory systems; biological response profiling and assessment. (4) Mathematics and Space Sciences; e.g., dynamics and control; physical mathematics and applied analysis; computational mathematics; optimization and discrete mathematics; signals communication and surveillance; software and systems; artificial intelligence; electromagnetics; space sciences. (5) Researcher Assistance Programs; e.g., United States Air Force/National Research Council-Resident Research Associateships; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program; United States Air Force/Summer Faculty Fellows Programs. Our overriding purpose in supporting this research is to advance the state-of-the-art in areas related to the technical problems the Air Force encounters in developing and maintaining a superior Air Force; in lowering the cost and improving the performance, maintainability, and supportability of Air Force weapon systems; and in creating and preventing technological surprise. AFOSR will seek technical options that may address our need for heightened attention to homeland defense, funding those good ideas that are relevant to the AF role, and assisting in getting other good ideas to the agencies that may find them of special relevance to their role. All pertinent information, including contact persons, evaluation criteria, and details on specific areas of interest, is discussed in the AFOSR pamphlet entitled "RESEARCH INTERESTS AND BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT 2004-1". Before sending a proposal, inquire if someone at AFOSR is interested in your field of work. That person can also provide guidance for preparing a proposal before you begin to develop the proposal. Additional information and guidance on format and proposal submittal may be found in AFOSR Pamphlet, "Proposer's Guide to AFOSR's Research Programs". This pamphlet is also available on the AFOSR web site. See Numbered Note 26

<DESC>1) Overview

The United States Postal Serviceís Package Services group intends to implement a turn-key solution for expedited packaging supplies fulfillment that reduces costs, increases efficiencies and improves the overall customer ordering experience with regard to supplies.  A vendor will be selected to warehouse packaging supplies inventory, interface with a USPS customer care center to accept orders and communicate order status, act as a liaison on behalf of the Postal Service with various manufacturers of packaging supplies for direct-vendor delivery, and ship orders from its own facilities.  The selected vendor will be further required to maintain order information, and produce summary reports to facilitate product assortment and operational decisions. 

ëExpedited packaging suppliesí refers to those items offered to customers at no additional charge for use with premier USPS servicesóExpress Mail, Priority Mail, and global delivery services.  The Postal Service offers customers a series of unique packaging solutions ranging from corrugated boxes and envelopes, to a range of pressure sensitive tape, labels, and decals.  Currently, the Postal Service offers customers a total of 68 different packaging-related items.  On average, approximately 162,000 supplies orders, which contain 3.82 items per order, are fulfilled each month.  Of these, approximately 29,000 are orders for one of five different custom-imaged labels.  These items are offered to further enhance customer convenience, and are imaged with 7 to 20 lines of variable text.  The average label order contained 249 labels.

The expedited packaging supplies program is a significant source of customer value and affects customer perception toward the premier offerings of the Postal Service.  Customers place orders for supplies via multiple channels, and this important experienceófrom order placement through receipt of the supplies orderóaffects the customerís perception toward the use of the services themselves.  The supplies fulfillment process, depending on the speed and accuracy with which it is administered, can serve to enhance, or detract from, customer retention.  The fulfillment center is an important part of this dynamic.

Though an important selling tool, the supplies program also carries considerable costs to administer.  For this reason, customer value must be balanced against the cost to the Postal Service of achieving it.  The solution planned seeks to achieve this balance, minimizing costs, while maintaining solid customer support.  To this end, Package Services seeks to pre-qualify suppliers who demonstrate extensive experience in the fulfillment industry, with world-class operations, comprehensive information systems, and a commitment to quality.  A comprehensive competitive solicitation will allow for overall reconfiguration, and afford opportunity for one or more strategic partnerships.   

2)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available fulfillment services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.

3)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondentís capability to provide an innovative and commercially available fulfillment services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Thoren Caging Systems, Inc., 815 West Seventh Street, PO Box 685, Hazelton, PA 18201 for the purchase of Maxi-Miser caging systems. The NCI Center for Cancer Research (CCR) conducts basic and clinical research on the causes, treatment and prevention of cancer and related diseases.  Animal models frequently are employed by CCR researchers not only to understand the basic biology of the disease state, but also to test novel pre-clinical treatments and interventions.  The NCI/CCR has been named the lead Institute for the outfitting and operation of the new vivarium in the Clinical Research Center (CRC).  This vivarium will replace a present NCI/CCR animal facility and will house the research animals of CCR investigators whose laboratories are located in the CRC and Bldg. 10. To optimize the capacity of the new vivarium, NCI/CCR proposes to use high density caging.  The purchase of 64 140 -cage mouse racks, 4 48-cage rat racks, 11 70-cage mouse racks are required to provide the greatest number of rodent cages in the facility footprint.  Thoren racks use the stainless steel shelves on their racks. The Thoren caging has a supply and exhaust port in the bottom of the shelf above the cage for air supply and exhaust.  Because these ports are in the bottom of the shelf, the cage and Reemay fit snuggly against the bottom of the shelf preventing escape of 99% of the exhaust air. Since 99+% of the exhaust air is captured and is not blown back into the animal room it prevents the spread of contamination among valuable research animals. This caging is compatible with existing Government owned caging which is used in the five existing CCR/NCI animal facilities, the racks can therefore, be interchanged between facilities.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications. This procurement contains both GSA and Open Market items and is being processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 2:30 PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on December 1, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendors responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 339999

<DESC>NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
INFORMATION ANALYSIS AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION DIRECTORATE, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

INTERNET PRIORITY SERVICE (IPS)
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION


1.	INTRODUCTION
1.1	Scope
The National Communications System (NCS) of the Department of Homeland Security is soliciting information regarding assured communications through the Internet.  This information is with respect to services or products that carriers, vendors, and third parties can provide, or plan in the future to provide, applicable to designing/developing an Internet Priority Service (IPS) capability to support national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) communications.  This request for information (RFI) seeks technical information regarding Internet-based assured communications for data, including Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).  Responses from all organizations including commercial entities, academic institutions, and Government departments and agencies, are encouraged. 
1.2	Background
Under the provisions of Executive Order 12472, the NCS is responsible for ensuring that an NS/EP telecommunications infrastructure exists and is responsive to the needs of the President and the Federal departments and agencies using public and private telecommunications systems.  In support of this mission, we have initiated several programs designed to overcome network failure and congestion during emergency situations, including the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS), Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP), and Wireless Priority Service (WPS) to address priority services for Federal, State, and local Critical Infrastructure leadership personnel during an emergency. 

The current implementations of priority service for NS/EP telecommunications consist of voice and voice-band data only in the circuit switched wire-line and wireless networks.  Due to the ever-increasing use of the Internet for transmission of all types of communications, we are looking at ways to provide similar types of assured communications for data applications and voice or video applications running over the Internet.  

Information learned from this RFI will be used to help NCS achieve the following goals:

∑	Identify plans and emerging technologies for providing priority services through the Internet.
∑	Accelerate promising technologies by prototyping and proof-of-concept projects.
∑	Promote industry wide adoption of these technologies through the industry standardization process
∑	Model technologies to determine what enhancements (if any) are required to meet the stringent NS/EP requirements.
∑	Enable the NCSís IPS to leverage and enhance future commercial priority service capabilities.

2.	AREAS OF INTEREST

The following functional goals of an IPS concept should be considered:

 
Enhanced Priority Treatment
Secure Networks
Ubiquitous Coverage
International Connectivity
Interoperable
Scalable Bandwidth
Mobility
Voice Band Service
Broadband Service
Reliability/Availability
Restorable
Survivable
Non-Traceable
Affordable

Ultimately, the service should be resilient to large-scale outages of the Internet infrastructure in addition to outages of other infrastructures the Internet is dependent upon-such as electric power and telecommunications.  It should also be resilient to cyber attacks originating within the Internet itself, such as denial of service, worms, etc.

Solutions should have ubiquitous coverage in that they translate to various physical and link layer technologies, locations, applications, and network topologies.  Specifically, we are looking for solutions that will provide end-to-end priority in inter-Autonomous Systems (AS) cross-provider environments, as well as within single provider networks.

To enable interoperability, we have IPS standards efforts underway; however, a lack of standards should not preclude a response--we are also interested in concepts and implementations that may be proprietary in nature, and have not yet been standardized.  Responders are encouraged to review the T1A1.2 committeeís ìRoadmap Standards in Support of Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS)î under the project T1A1-19 ìReliability/Availability of IP-based Networks and Services,î whose concepts are reflected throughout this RFI.

An IPS should have a large set of capabilities to potentially be of service during disaster recovery activities.  Since not all of the following features are currently available, responses are not expected to meet all of these criteria; however, IPS features and objectives could include the following:

∑	Multimedia and telephony services 
∑	Rapid user authentication
∑	Security protection of user traffic
∑	Preferential access to telecomm facilities
∑	Preferential establishment of communications
∑	Preferential routing of traffic
∑	Preferential use of remaining operational resources
∑	Preferential completion of user traffic to destination
∑	Allowable degradation of service quality
∑	Interchange of critical telecomm service management information
∑	Optional preemption of non-emergency traffic (where permitted by regulation)

The objective is to provide priority service for Internet applications critical to essential personnel during a crisis.  Preliminary analysis shows that numerous approaches are possible due to the design of the protocol model and state that makes up the Internet; however, prioritized delivery of individual packets at the lower layers of the Internet protocol model does not guarantee that transactions will gain priority processing on end systems and servers.  Since any single protocol is likely to be insufficient to guarantee priority, several approaches may need to be combined to form an operational system.

In addition to end-to-end solutions, we are interested in individual submissions that may consist of building blocks for an overall IPS architecture.  Responses should address how these building blocks fit within the traditional Internet model to eventually provide an end-to-end solution.  Specifically, the following areas should be addressed:

∑	Link Layer.  A large variety of layer 2 link level technologies are incorporated within the Internet.  Enhancements applicable to priority services for High-speed optical backbone technologies such as SONET, Packet over SONET, MPLS, Gigabit Ethernet, DWDM, and ATM are of interest.  Also of interest are enhancements applicable to access technologies such as DSL, cable modem, and fixed wireless, in addition to priority within mobile wireless protocols such as messaging, 3G cellular data, and satellite data.
∑	Network Layer.  Internet Protocol (IP) makes up the entire network layer for the Internet.  There are two versions of IP applicable to this RFI.  IP Version 4 is the current protocol that operates the majority of the Internet.  IP v6 will eventually replace IP v4, with superior addressing, security, priority and other features.  We are interested in approaches that are applicable to either or both versions of IP.
∑	Transport Layer.  Protocols designed to assure data transmission end-to-end or hop-by-hop through the Internet often are considered transport layer enhancements.  The IETF has standardized a number of approaches, so implementations of these are of interest to us.  Additional concepts and proprietary implementations in this area are also of interest. 
∑	Application Layer.  Applications control the Internet; as an example BGP and DNS are applications that are considered core infrastructure pieces of the Internet.  Applications also make up the services that utilize the Internet.  Of interest are application enhancements that will lead to one or more of the fourteen functional goals for an assured IPS.  Applications of particular interest include (but are not limited to) email, messaging, web, VoIP, (transport and edge), and video.  
∑	Standards and APIs.  We are also interested in standards or APIs that have been developed in these areas, whether or not implemented in products or services.

3.	RESPONSE GUIDELINES
3.1	Scope
Most organizations do not have expertise or capabilities in all of the areas described above; therefore, responses addressing only a subset of or single identified area(s) of interest are also welcome.  Responses should be clearly labeled with the areas of interest that are discussed.  Length of responses should be limited to no more than 40 pages.
3.2	Structure
Provide any materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate.  In addition, please provide ample contact information, including telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, to facilitate any needed clarification or further discussion.  Include, as appropriate, the following:  

∑	Description of Products/Technologies/Research/Standards/APIs, including performance information
∑	Plans for commercial use of these technologies
∑	Corporate partners who will use the technology
∑	Feasibility Assessment
∑	Cost and Schedule Estimates
∑	Existing Government Contracts
∑	Corporate Expertise
3.3	Format
Electronic and hard copy formats are both acceptable, although electronic submission is preferred.  If provided electronically, submissions should be in a Microsoft Office compatible format or Adobe Acrobat.  Copies may be emailed to Mr. Dave Nolan at noland@ncs.gov or mailed to the address below.
3.4	Deadline
Responses are due 60 days after release of this RFI.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA W56HZV-SANG-LAV-STS-001 Saudi Arabian National Guard - Light Armored Vehicle System Technical Support services. The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) intends on awarding a contract for approximately 10,000 hours of STS services over a 5 year period to General Dynamics Land Systems √¢¬Ä¬ì Canada (GDLS-C).  The effort will be the development and preparation of engineering change proposals (ECPs) against variants of the LAV owned and operated by the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG).    No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.   The STS services to be procured are in support of the SANG fleet of Light Armored Vehicles (LAVs).  The contract will call for the development and submission of engineering change proposals (ECPs) on an as-required basis through the life of the contract. Typical STS activities could include field-dictated re-design, system integration, analysis and recommendation of solutions to human factors issues; and to handle issues relating to reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety engineering.  A giv en requirement for an ECP would start with recommendations to research configuration and systems problems on SANG LAV configuration issues as they arise, and result in recommended solutions through development of ECPs.  Recommendations for proposed ECPs wo uld come from the FMS customer, the Program Manager√¢¬Ä¬ôs Office at TACOM, or the vehicle manufacturer.  The contract will be for an initial 2,500 hours (over 2 years), plus three one-year options for 2,500 hours each, for a total of 10,000 hours.  The co ntract will require full access to the manufacturer's technical data package (TDP) for each variant of the LAV.  The USG does not own the rights to the technical data and cannot provide the data.  The data is controlled exclusively by GDLS-C. Individuals seeking information concerning this notice should contact Mr. Hal Porter, AMSTA-PM-LAV-B, telephone (586) 574-8793, or email porterh@tacom.army.mil.

<DESC>NA The Government intends to award two indefinite delivery contracts for architecutral-engineering services from proposals received in response to this solicitation. Point of Contact: Clarence A. Miller, (509) 527-7217; clarence.a.miller@nww01.usace.army.mil. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The Government intends to procure two contracts in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 37.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required wor k.  Types of services required will include preliminary assessments, site investigations, surveying, studies, reports and design. The NAICS code is 541330, which has a small business size standard of maximum $4.0 million in average annual receipts for its previous 3 fiscal years. Responses to this announcement will be accepted from all responsible firms, regardless of business size.  However, eligibility for both awards will be based on this cascading order of precedence.  If the government receives responses from at least five highly qualified small business firms, both awards will be made to small business firms.  If the government receives responses from at least three highly qualified small business firms, the first award will go to a small business and the second award will be unrestricted.  The Government will use the following methodology to establish eligibility for contract aw ard using the cascading order of precedence:  In addition to the other information required to be submitted, each firm responding to this announcement must indicate their size status under the specified NAICS code.  Small business concerns receiving an awa rd under the Small Business Set-aside will be subject to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  Initially the Government will only evaluate the qualifications of the A-E firms that state that they are competing for the award under the small busines s set-aside.  Both procurements will be awarded to responsible small business A-E concerns, provided that at least five small businesses are determined to be highly qualified (e.g. short-listed) and the Government is able to negotiate a fair market price w ith two of the short-listed firms.  If responses are received from at least three, but not five, eligible small business firms that are considered by the Government to be highly qualified for this procurement and the Government is able to negotiate a fair market price with one of the short-listed small business firms, the first award will be made to that firm and the second award will be made on the basis of full and open competition from all responsible competing business concerns.  In either case, if the government is not able to successfully negotiate a fair market price, the small business set-aside will be automatically cancelled and awards will be made on the basis of full and open competition.  All respondents, unless requested otherwise in the propos al, will be considered if the small business set-aside is cancelled.  The same contractor will not be awarded both contracts.  Contracts awarded from this solicitation must be awarded no later than one year from the date that the responses to this synopsis  are due.  The first contract is anticipated to be awarded in May 2004.  With the award of more than one contract as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows: (1) all awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $2,500. (2) in making selection of the awardee to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer may consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of p revious task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firm's strengths and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the scope of work for each task order. Price will not be a factor in the task order se lection. The two Indefinite Delivery Type contracts will be awarded for a base period and up to two additional option periods.  The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  The contract amount will not exceed $1,000,000 in any period.  The bas e period and option periods will not exceed one year each, but option periods may be exercised when the contract amount for the current period has been reached or nearly reached.

These technologies are defined as methods by which the energy content of packaging waste, specifically plastic packaging can be rapidly and efficiently converted to a viable fuel for in-the-field electric power generation.  The U.S. military land-based operations of the future are intended to be self-sustaining and must minimize long logistics tails.  Units engaged in stationary field operations generate substantial quantities of solid waste in the form of packaging materials.  Personnel, fuel, and critical transport equipment are needed to support the removal and disposal of these large volumes of packaging waste.  The quantities involved today (estimated to be over 7 lb/day/soldier) can potentially overwhelm the capacity of foreign nations waste disposal systems creating health concerns, security issues, and possible future liabilities.  Reduction of packaging waste through reduction of packaging use is not likely to be attainable at any significant level due to health, security, and operation requirements.  Alternative solutions are required.  Plastic packaging waste has energy content that can approach that of diesel fuel. Diesel fuel has lower heating value of 43.9MJ/kg with a hydrogen content of 12.5 weight percent. Plastic heating values can range from 26-43MJ/kg with a hydrogen content of 5-14 percent.  If the energy content of the waste is optimized for secondary use as a fuel source, at todayís level of discarded packaging, a military unit could achieve well over 100 percent self-sufficiency for their generator fuel needs.  The challenge is to develop a technology that can efficiently harness the energy content of a plastic-based packaging waste stream in the field and do so in a timely manner. Successful development of a MISER unit would increase the availability of power-when-needed in the field while simultaneously zeroing the logistics waste footprint.  Known technologies include gasification and pyrolysis.  These tend to be energy intensive, very inefficient, and leave significant byproduct that requires disposal.  In addition, the technologies capture only a small part of the energy content of waste.  It is the intent of this BAA to solicit proposals that only consider revolutionary advancements in waste-to-fuel conversion technologies. The goal of this program is to explore the possibility of achieving nearly complete plastic packaging waste reduction while harnessing 90 percent of the packaging energy content for use in electricity generation.  Since trends indicate that future military packaging will be plastic-based, proposals must make their primary focus the conversion of plastic waste.  Two types of plastic waste will be considered:  petroleum-based plastic (polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene mix) or the recently developed bioplastics (plastics made from non-petroleum sources).  Performers must specify the type of waste they intend to convert. The proposed MISER program should describe a 36-month effort that is broken down into two 18-month phases. The Phase I milestones for this program are a proof-of-concept that includes: 1) The continuous conversion of a standardized (1/3 each of polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene), pre-shredded plastic waste to fuel at a rate of  8.2 lbs/hr minimum with no more than 10 percent unconverted, solid residue.  
2) Demonstration that the fuel created can produce 24 hours of continuous power generation using a specified commercial-off-the-shelf 5 kW generator.  (Note: 8.2 lbs/hr assumes capturing 70 percent of the energy from the plastic and a fuel product that is at least 70 percent as efficient as JP-8 in a generator.  If the generation of hydrogen is the target fuel, continuous power generation using an identified 5kW PEM fuel cell must be achieved).  3) Demonstration that the process can be scaled to meet the goals of Phase II.  The Phase II requirements are a portable, integrated, packaged prototype that can generate 5 kW electric power for one week by converting 6.5 lbs/hr actual plastic waste (90 percent energy capture).  The size of the MISER unit must be sufficient to be transported on a standard, three-fourths of a ton, two-axel trailer. There are several technical challenges that will need to be addressed in order to successfully develop and demonstrate a mobile, sustainable, waste-to-fuel technology.  These include: a) utilizing only the energy content of the waste to fuel the process, b) minimizing the generation of solid residue to less than 10 percent of input and, c) producing a quality fuel that can continuously run a generator or a fuel cell, d) scaling the MISER unit for portability.  The successful proposal must detail the plan for running the waste-to-fuel conversion process that minimizes the amount of additional energy needed to perform the conversion.  It is expected that start-up of the process will require some external power; however, continuous operation should be self-sustaining.  The proposal must discuss the mass and energy balance and the minimization of the solid plastic-based residue production from the process. (Note: plastic packaging today is known to contain inorganic fillers, and this issue need not be addressed.)  Because the quality of the fuel is important in generating electrical power, a sufficient understanding of the anticipated fuel quality and how it can be tailored to meet the generator needs must be included. Since this program does not wish to concentrate on generator improvement, the metrics of this program have taken into account the possibility that the performance of the generator may decrease.  The performer must demonstrate that the fuel the proposed MISER process generates is reasonably suitable for sustained generator use.  The MISER unit is expected to be utilized in the field therefore both size and weight represents important parameters that must be addressed.   In determining the success of Phase I, size and weight are not critical factors, however they will be important in the Phase II effort. When describing the process details, the following parameters must be clearly spelled out: 1) Mass of fuel out per mass of waste in [kg/kg]; 2) Fuel lower heating value [MJ/kg]; 3) Parasitic energy requirements (electrical and thermal) per mass of waste in [kJ/kg]; 4) Residence time for waste in the reaction zone. If requested by the Government, it is expected that proof-of-concept deliverables will be made available for testing by an independent laboratory that will be selected by the Government.  Finally, as part of the Phase I deliverable, proposers are to provide detailed technology optimization and prototype design plans for proceeding to the Phase II deliverable of a prototype device that meets or exceeds the program goals for power generation.  The results of the Phase I proof-of-concept will serve as a go/no-go decision point for continuing the effort.   The final deliverable of any project funded under the MISER program is expected to be a mobile waste-to-fuel unit integrated with a 5 kW generator or fuel cell.  The independent laboratory selected by the Government will verify this performance.  TEAMING. Success in Mobile Integrated Sustainable Energy Recovery is dependent on the formation of a well-managed, interdisciplinary team that should possess the necessary theoretical, engineering, polymer, fuel, power generation, thermal management, design, and the experimental expertise required to accomplish their proposed research.  There are no definitive requirements for the types of institutions (industry, university, etc.) that make up any particular team.  Members of the interdisciplinary teams will be required to work collaboratively, and collectively maintain sharp focus toward achieving the objectives. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS. White Papers are not sought for this addendum.  Full proposals must be submitted no later than, 4:00PM (ET), January 16, 2004.  Each proposal should 1) explicitly address tests, demonstrations, and other research activities planned in the area(s) of interest described above, 2) include at least two specific and quantitative 18-month scientific and/or technical objectives for each scientific/technical area of interest addressed in the proposal that clearly demonstrate the research is on track for meeting the ultimate program goals, 3) include clearly delineated intellectual property arrangements and transition paths, and 4) include identification and assessment of critical scientific and/or technical barriers to the program objective and plausible approaches to develop solutions or overcome their limiting effects.  Proposed Phase 1 efforts should not exceed 18 months, but consideration should be given to possible continuation of the effort into Phase 2.  If multiple awards are made, down-selection may occur annually based on technical progress and achievements.  Proposals with cost share should clearly identify the specific tasks to be cost-shared in the technical proposal and separately break out the corresponding costs in the cost proposal.

<DESC>The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) has a need for program management and oversight office services in support of the Iraq Infrastructure Reconstruction Office (IIRO).  Two solicitations will be issued by the Pentagon Renovation Program on behalf of the CPA and IIRO.  The first solicitation will be for program management and oversight office services for the overarching Project Management Office (PMO).  The PMO will oversee and manage six separate Sector Project Management Offices (SPMO).  The second solicitation will be for Program and Construction Management support of the SPMOs.  Each Sector corresponds to a Ministry within the Iraqi government:  1) Transportation and Communications Sector; 2) Electricity Sector, 3) Buildings/Health Sector, 4) Security/Justice Sector, 5) Public Works/Water Resources Sector, and 6) Oil Sector.  The PMO/SPMOs are responsible for Financial Management, Contracting, and Programming (program, project, and construction management).  Accordingly, the PMO/SPMO contractors will be required to provide expertise in these areas.  One award is anticipated under the PMO solicitation and multiple awards are anticipated under the SPMO solicitation (one award for each of the six sectors).  Each cost plus award fee contract will have a performance period of two years with options to extend performance on a level of effort basis.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 with a small business size standard of $6,000.000.00.  It is anticipated that the solicitations will be issued electronically on or about 03 Dec 2003 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.eps.gov/.  Paper copies will not be available.  Once the solicitations are posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/ amendments to any and all documents.  Offerors are therefore strongly encouraged to register for the Vendor Notification Service on FedBizOps, to be automatically alerted of any updates/changes.  A draft of each solicitation is expected to be posted by 21 Nov 03, accordingly offerors are encouraged to review the draft solicitations and advised that the Ability to Succeed (Past Performance and Financial Capacity) volume will be due on or about 05 Dec 03 with Management and Cost/Price volumes due on or about 29 Dec 03.  The Pentagon Renovation Program will host an Offerorís Day Conference during the week of 08 Dec 03.  Offerors who submitted the Ability to Succeed volume will be invited to attend the conference.  Information regarding the Offerorís Day Conference will be posted in FedBizOps.  Dependent upon completion of evaluations for Past Performance and Financial Capacity, an advisory down-select may be provided to offerors prior to submission of the Management and Cost/Price Volumes.  Special conditions for submission of offers and award will be included in the solicitation packages.  Any prospective contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  Information concerning CCR registered requirements may be viewed via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling the CCR Registration Center at 1-888-227-2423.  This will be a Best Value acquisition.  The Government may select for award the offeror whose price is not necessarily the lowest, but whose technical proposal is more advantageous to the Government and warrants the additional cost.  Questions regarding the PMO and SPMO solicitations may be directed to IIRO@army.pentagon.mil.  NOTE:  THE DRAFT RFP PACKAGE WILL BE POSTED ON THE PENTAGON RENOVATION PROGRAM WEBSITE LOCATED AT http://renovation.pentagon.mil NO LATER THAN CLOSE OF BUSINESS FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 2003.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, with administrative corrections, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  The administrative corrections (1) updates the contracting POC in the body of the announcement, (2) deletes the ombudsman program for the announcement and (3) deletes the requirement to send IFB a copy of the white paper cover letter.  POC: Paul Antonik P.E., Program Manager, 315-330-7057; (Paul.Antonik@rl.af.mil); Braham Himed, PhD, Program Manager, 315-330-2551; (Braham.Himed@rl.af.mil); and Renee F. Arcuri, Contracting Officer, 315-330-4777; (Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil). AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the following two topic areas. 1) WAVEFORM DIVERSITY FOR AMTI/GMTI/IMAGING APPLICATIONS. The objective of this task is to develop and demonstrate spatially and temporally adaptive RF sensor technology for application to air, space, and ground systems operating in isolation or in concert with other sensor systems. Environmental awareness is critical to the process of spatial and temporal adaptivity via transmit waveform diversity. Any sensor incorporating this technology must be capable of sensing sources of electromagnetic radiation such as other sensor systems, communications and navigation signals, and selecting regions of the spectrum best suited to the mission(s), given the surveillance region, coverage and revisit requirements, as well as the EM environment. Appropriate waveforms and parameters are selected accordingly. Spatial-temporal adaptivity adds several unique features to radar systems. Namely, it provides the ability to deny a coherent sidelobe reference signal to an off-mainlobe enemy receiver desiring to operate in a non-cooperative bistatic mode of operation or attempting to intercept communications signals. The integration of joint adaptivity on transmit and receive provides spatial-temporal modulation. This allows the radiation of signals with different information content in various directions and full adaptivity on receive. This is fundamental to advance multi-mission sensor concepts. This includes a formed mainlobe for radar applications in one (or more) direction while simultaneously communicating with field units, fighting forces, and field commanders in other directions. Spatial adaptivity methods will be investigated and evaluated for monostatic and bistatic applications to radar AMTI, GMTI and imaging applications. Spatial adaptivity will be investigated in the context of combining radar operation at selected angles with the embedding of communications or navigation signals at other angles. Finally, the adaptive radar signal processing algorithm(s) must work in conjunction with the added spatial-temporal adaptivity. Appropriate algorithms shall be developed to work in concert with waveform diverse radars. (POC: Mr. Paul Antonik, AFRL/SNRT, 315-330-7057; Paul.Antonik@rl.af.mil.) A related topic area is: 2) COMMONALITY AMONG MULTI-MISSION ADAPTIVE RADAR ALGORITHMS. The objective of this task is to establish a set of parameters, which describes the various modes of operation in emerging airborne/space borne radar technologies. Additionally, focus on the detection of advanced threats, or threats under cover, will be emphasized. There is a growing need to improve interference (clutter and jamming) rejection not just in the angle-Doppler sidelobes, but in the mainlobe as well. Improved target (air and ground) detection will also be achieved under this effort. This leads to polarization as a natural discriminant in the development and demonstration of these adaptive radar signal-processing algorithms. Furthermore, the integration of polarimetric processing with multi-channel adaptive processing (STAP) offers an opportunity to optimize degrees of freedom selection and processing domain (element space versus beamspace, multi-channel feed reflector systems versus fully populated and adaptive phased arrays, etc). Additionally, compatibility of the filtering process (STAP) with the (CFAR) detection process (as well as discrimination) is essential in this effort. In the initial stage, parametric analysis will be used to optimize performance. For different radar configurations and geometries, variation in coherent dwell, degrees of freedom, and waveform parameters, are essential segments in signal processing optimization. Specifically, the focus of this effort shall be on multiple modes of operations for air targets, ground targets, imaging and SIGINT missions. The need to interleave waveforms modes further compounds problems in the signal/data processor, since one unit will have to perform all functions under all modes of operation. As such, adaptive algorithms are to be included in the suite of algorithms under consideration. Finally, the algorithm suite developed under this effort must be applicable to space radar systems designed to operate in either multi-sensor or single sensor configurations. (POC: Dr. Braham Himed, AFRL/SNRT, 315-330-2551; Braham.Himed@rl.af.mil.) Demonstrations utilizing the AFRL Surveillance Facility are permitted and encouraged under this BAA. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to four (4) page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small business, Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Braham Himed, PhD.

White papers will be accepted until September 30, 2005. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent award. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, b) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, and d) The Government will consider other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort. The criteria used to evaluate proposals will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. Only (a), (b), and (c) above will apply to white papers. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY-00 Individual awards will not normally range from 6 months to 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 per year. Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.8M. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submissions. All responsible firms may submit a white paper, which shall be considered. Responders are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Renee Arcuri, for information if they contemplate responding. Export-controlled technical data may be involved; only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed to access such data. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Service Center at 1-800-352-3572. Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the Secret level, therefore personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for, or access to Secret information. The cost of preparing proposals in response this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY-00-30Aug00; FY-01-30Jul01; FY-02-30Jul02; FY-03-30Jul03. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each Fiscal Year after the dates cited. This BAA is open and effective until September 30, 2005.

STATEMENT OF WORK
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS              

1. BACKGROUND
 
 The Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center (DFAS/CA) performs financial and accounting functions for several governmental agencies conducting various operations throughout the world.  The Center currently has a one-year contract, which expires on December 31, 2003.  The purpose of this solicitation is to open the bidding to interested parties in establishing a long-term contract for a process that allows the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center to continue paying foreign vendors/contractors in a variety of foreign currencies.
 
2. SCOPE

A. Concept of Operations:

1.  Disbursements -

The Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center will establish an account(s) with the contract bank.  When processing foreign currency payment(s) to foreign vendors/contractors, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center shall notify the contract bank of the impending payment(s).  Upon notification, the contract bank shall purchase the amount of foreign currency required for the payment(s) and provide the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center the exchange rate and U.S. Dollar equivalent.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center will process the payment(s) in U.S. Dollars for deposit into an established account for subsequent transfer by the contract bank to the payee in the specified foreign currency.  The contract bank should have the capability of transferring foreign currency via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or Check/Draft.  The proposed system should eliminate the need for Limited Depository Accounts (LDAs), as outlined in the DoDFMR, Volume 5, Chapter 14.

2.  Erroneous Payments -

In the event an erroneous payment is made, it may be necessary for the contract bank to research the payment and provide copies of documents related to that payment.  If the payment must be voided and collected back into the account, the contract bank must refund the exact U.S. Dollar amount at the exchange rate quoted for the original disbursement resulting in no gain or loss due to exchange fluctuation.   





3.  Collections -

The contract bank should also have the capability of receiving and forwarding collections from debtors.  These would be payments made payable to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center in a foreign currency.  The contract bank would receive the foreign currency payments and convert such payments to a U.S. Dollar equivalent for deposit into an account.  The contract bank would then forward the U.S. Dollar amount to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center.  The contracted process should have no limitations regarding the volume and dollar amount of Collection transactions being processed by the Contract Bank and forwarded to the Columbus Center.  

4.  Payment Date -

The payment date shall be defined as the date on which foreign currency draft or electronic funds transfer (EFT) payments are dated.  The Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center shall establish the payment date in which the foreign currency payment must be made.  The contract bank shall be responsible to ensure the payment is made on the established payment date.  Coordination will be made between the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Columbus Center and contract bank to ensure funds are on deposit in the account on the payment date.

The Contractor shall be able to lock in a rate for a minimum of °ßcurrent plus five business days°® for all supported currencies to allow time for transactions to be entered in DoD systems (i.e., entitlement, disbursing, and accounting systems).  The contractor shall also be able to provide an exchange rate that is valid for entire day for all currencies.

B. Disbursing Transactions:
 
The average number of foreign currency transactions for the current Fiscal Year has been 135 transactions per month.  The dollar amount of each transaction may range between $50 to $3,000,000 per transaction. With the consolidation of DFAS Europe to the Columbus Center, an increase in volume is projected to approximately 18,750 transactions a year. The contracted process should have no limitations regarding the volume and dollar amount of Disbursement transactions being processed by the Columbus Center.

C. Fiduciary Relationship:
 
 By definition and according to the terms of the contract, the contract bank shall act as an instrument for the Defense Finance and Accounting - Columbus Center in processing foreign currency transactions.  
 
 
 
 
D. Records Retention:              
 
All records and data turned over to the Contractor as well as any new records and data created by the Contractor remain the property of the Government.  The Contractor shall only use information obtained from direct input by DFAS staff or other data requesters into the Contractor's stand alone system for the purpose for which the data was provided.  The Contractor shall be responsible for retaining the data, as a backup, for a minimum of 6 years and 3 month, as outlined in the Office of the Federal Register, National Archives, and Records Administration.   
 This period will require the contract bank to continue the retention and availability of records beyond the expiration/termination of the contract. The contract bank shall retain transaction records that are consistent with the requirements of the Disbursing Office. 
 
E. System Architecture:  

Any foreign currency related product should be able to accommodate the following computer system architecture:

Pentium 3 (900 Megahertz) IBM Compatible Personal Computers
128 Megabyte of RAM  
20 Gigabyte Hard Drive.
3.5 Floppy and 32X CD ROM Drive.  
Windows 2000  (Note: Future plans will change to Windows XP).
Office 97 
Microsoft°¶s Internet Explorer 6.02

F. Support/Maintenance:                
 
It shall be incumbent upon the contract bank to support the process both administratively and technically.  Such support should include material and training to explain the process with direct access to support personnel should questions or situations arise which require an immediate response. The Contractor°¶s primary representative or alternate(s) shall be available during normal duty hours within 60 minutes, and within 2 hours after normal duty hours to discuss problem areas.

G.              Type of Contract: Fixed Price Contract:
 
 The proposal should be structured in such a way as to provide a fixed price for establishing, maintaining and supporting the proposed process.  The offeror shall address the capability to perform and all costs associated with their proposed process, to include:

4.  EVALUATION

A. The primary evaluation factors are listed below in ascending order of importance, unless otherwise indicated.

1. Operational Approach

The offeror shall provide a concise summary in response to Paragraphs 2.A-D  as outlined in this Statement of Work.  The offeror shall also address his/her capability of meeting the transitional requirements specified under Paragraph 2.I.  This section is limited to eight (8) pages, including any addendums, and should address any planned future enhancement to the proposed process. 

	2.  Technical Approach  

The offeror shall provide a list of all support and maintenance functions related to their proposed process as outlined under Paragraphs 2.E-F.  This section is limited to four (4) pages, including any addendums.  

	3.  Cost 

The offeror shall provide a detailed list of all costs associated with the implementation, maintenance and support of the process.  This section should clearly address costs related to items listed under Paragraph 2.G and is limited to four (4) pages, including any addendums.

4.  System Requirements 

The offeror shall provide a concise summary in response to items listed under Paragraph 2.J and is limited to five (5) pages, including any addendums.

	B.	Scoring Method.  The following method will be used in assessing each operational, technical and cost proposal as outlined in this Statement of Work:  

	Outstanding-4	Very significantly exceeds most or all of the requirements.  Response exceeds a "Better" rating.  The Offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.

	Better-3	Fully meets all of the requirements and significantly exceeds many of the requirements.  Response exceeds an "Acceptable" rating.  The areas in which the Offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.

	Acceptable-2	Meets all of the requirements.  Complete, comprehensive, and exemplifies an understanding of the scope and depth of the task requirements as well as the Offeror's understanding of the Government's requirements.

	Marginal-1	Less than "Acceptable."  There are some deficiencies in the technical proposal.  However, given the opportunity for discussions, the technical proposal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least "Acceptable."  (Areas of a technical proposal which remain to be "Marginal" after "Final Revisions" offers shall not be subject to further discussion or revision.)	If award is made on initial offers, there will not be an opportunity for discussions, nor a chance to become at least "Acceptable."

	Unacceptable-0	Technical proposal has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions: Failure to understand much of the scope of work necessary to perform the required tasks; failure to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Government's requirements; failure to meet many of the requirements.  (When applying this adjective to the technical proposal as a whole, the technical proposal must be so unacceptable in one or more areas that it would have to be completely revised to attempt to make it other than unacceptable.)


5.  AWARD - BEST VALUE

	A.	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from an operational, technical and cost standpoint.  

	B.	Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Department of Defense Supplement (DFARS).  One contractor will be selected for award on the basis of their proposal being the most advantageous to the Government.    

	C.	All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are equally as important as cost or price.  As such, the Government may elect to pay a price premium to select an Offeror whose operational and/or technical evaluation factors are superior.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is seeking information and capabilities statements from responsible small and large business firms for the disposal of waste paper that is currently stored at the National Record Centers of NARA throughout the United States.  The material requires two types of disposalógovernment-witnessed and contractor-witnessed.  Government-witnessed material must be destroyed in the presence of a government agent and by one of two methods: direct pulping or shredding to 5/16 strips.  Contractor-witnessed material must simply be destroyed and a certification of destruction must then be processed.  In general, all paper to be disposed of is contaminated, i.e., contains paper clips, plastic, glue, etc.  The Contractor would be responsible for the following:
	1.	supplying trailers at each facility so NARA employees can load the material 
	2.	transportation of material from the centers to the destruction facility
	3.	coordinating pick-up schedules with each center depending on required disposal dates
	4.	ensuring means of constant communication between NARA officials and drivers of trucks containing government-witnessed material
	5.	destruction of material according to NARA standards
The anticipated requirement is for one-year base period with four one-year option periods.  The Contractor would need to be able to accommodate a phase-in plan as each center currently has an agreement or a contract in place.  As these contracts end, NARA would expect the vendor to incorporate the center into its Nationwide activities.  The following locations comprise the NARA Nationwide Network:

<SUBJECT>R -- Request For Information - DFAS Accounting Services
<DESC>Defense Finance and Accounting Service
Accounting Business Line (ABL) Request for Information (RFI)

NOTE:  DUE TO FEDBIZOPS SPACE CONSTRAINTS THE ENTIRE RFI CAN BE FOUND AT WWW.DFAS.MIL AT THE FOLLOWING LINK: HTTP://WWW.DFAS.MIL/ABOUT/ACQUISITIONS/AS_INDEX.HTM.  YOU WILL NEED TO OBTAIN THE FULL RFI IN ORDER TO RESPOND.

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEFENSE FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING SERVICE (DFAS) in January 1991 was an important first step in the continuing process to improve the Department of Defense (DoD) finance and accounting operations.  Prior to DFAS, DoD performed finance and accounting functions at various installations/activities using non-standard systems and procedures.  Over the years, DFAS consolidated from 338 offices to 26, reduced manpower by 9,200 positions, reduced systems from 324 to 65, reorganized into business line structure, and received an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002.

DFAS CONSISTS OF THREE MAJOR BUSINESS LINES, ONE BEING ACCOUNTING SERVICES.  The Accounting Services Business Line (ABL) is responsible for providing responsive, professional finance and accounting service to the DoD by recording financial events, classifying, summarizing, and reporting the results of business transactions in financial (monetary) terms, monitoring budget execution, and analyzing the results of these processes.  The ABL performs these operations for appropriated/general funds, working capital funds, and trust fund activities.  DFAS accounting professionals develop procedures to implement federal accounting requirements mandated by Congress, Office of Management and Budget, Department of Treasury and DoD, and maintain the current operational accounting systems to accomplish their accounting service mission.

The DFAS has announced four additional Accounting Business Case Analyses for Fiscal Year 2004.  As a result, A JOINT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is being published to obtain Industry interest in accomplishing services for:

AIR FORCE ACCOUNTING
ARMY ACCOUNTING
DEFENSE AGENCY ACCOUNTING 
NAVY ACCOUNTING

THE PURPOSE OF THIS RFI IS TO CONDUCT MARKET RESEARCH to determine if the private sector has the capability and interest to perform DFAS Accounting Services.  This is not a solicitation for services.  This RFI presents some background of each accounting network, clarifies the purpose, provides an overview of the four DFAS Accounting entities, includes approximate staffing levels, and lists specific instructions for providing information about the capabilities of potential private sector service providers to perform these services.

Air Force, Army, Defense Agency, and Navy Accounting are separate entities under the ABL and are performed at different DFAS locations, which will be outlined later in this document.  Note:  Marine Corps Accounting is NOT included in this document.

Please note that responses to this RFI can be accomplished by Accounting Network (e.g., Navy Accounting, Air Force Accounting, Army Accounting and/or Defense Agency Accounting); by Accounting function (e.g., Departmental Level Accounting, Field Level Accounting, functional Systems Management); or any combination thereof.

OVERVIEW OF ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS:

	Overall, all four Accounting Lines (Air Force, Army, Navy, and Defense Agency) provide similar types of services (accounting product lines) for their respective customers as follows:

FIELD LEVEL ACCOUNTING/REPORTING support services which include budgetary and proprietary accounting, reporting and accounting statement preparation for all funds (general/appropriated, working capital, revolving and trust).  At a minimum this would include accounts payable; accounts receivable; billings; cash accountability; funds authentication; accounting for plant, property and equipment and other elements of expense; and preparation and consolidation of assigned Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) accounting and financial management reports. 

DEPARTMENTAL ACCOUNTING/REPORTING services which involve the consolidation, reconciliation, and roll-up of trial balances and subsidiary accounts into consolidated budget execution reports and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act financial statements; and reconciling and reporting cash accountability to the Department of Treasury. 

MANAGEMENT AND CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT of accounting processes which include accounting procedures and guidance; accounting systems functional maintenance and support to accomplish capturing, transmitting, analyzing, recording and reporting accounting transactions; electronic commerce and business process improvement initiatives; and customer service and business management.

	For purposes of this RFI, Field Level and Departmental Accounting/Reporting services can be further categorized in 10 CORE ACCOUNTING PROCESSES.  This RFI will relate each of these areas to the specific business line entities later in this document, as each Accounting network does not perform all 10.  

MAINTAIN GENERAL LEDGERS ñ involves receiving and processing data for general ledgers, validating incoming data, performing follow up concerning missing reports and/or data; recording departmental level entries, providing assistance to the field sites, explaining balance issues, submitting final reports, preparing journal vouchers.

PERFORMS FUNDS CONTROL ñ BUDGETARY ACCOUNTING - involves recording obligations, monitoring funds availability, recording expenditures, reconciling fund targets, monitoring reimbursable orders, recording commitments.

MAINTAIN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ñ involves preparing billings, recognizing revenue (establish estimates), establishing receivables, maintaining and updating account information, recording collections, managing delinquent debt, managing advances, managing unfunded reimbursables.

MAINTAIN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE ñ involves recording payments, accruing liabilities, recognizing liabilities and establishing payables; processing payments; maintaining electronic funds transfer data; conducting unliquidated obligation reviews; processing billings.

MAINTAIN INVENTORY ACCOUNTING ñ involves reconciling inventories; processing adjustments; updating inventory; reviewing and validating end of month/year inventory reports; validating and adjusting sales of inventory.

PERFORM  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ACCOUNTING ñ involves reviewing and validating end of month/year fixed asset reports; preparing journal vouchers for property/plant/equipment; receiving incoming data for property/plant/equipment; reconciling data.

PERFORM PAYROLL ACCOUNTING ñ involves processing payroll data and accruing wages for both US and Local National civilians and military personnel at standard rates.

MAINTAIN COST ACCOUNTING ñ involves performance of cost accounting and monitoring cost accounting.

GeENERATE ACCOUNTING REPORTS ñ involves receiving and processing data for accounting reports; recording installation, departmental, and agency entries for accounting reports; creating installation, departmental and agency accounting reports; providing customer assistance; accumulating information for accounts receivable reports; providing trust fund accounting reports; and providing ad hoc financial information reports to the military services, Defense Agencies, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), OSD, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Department of Treasury and Congress. 

MAINTAIN CASH REPORTING ñ involves processing departmental and detail cash reporting, resolving problem disbursements.

As previously stated, in addition to the preceding 10 core accounting processes, are functions related to management and continual improvement of the accounting, which includes functional Systems Management.  While legacy systems are primarily used to support accounting operations, there are many manual work-around processes within Accounting.  Although the processes within these function may be few in number, the manual labor to perform these processes result in expending many man-hours to support the work.  

AN OVERVIEW OF EACH ACCOUNTING NETWORK IS PROVIDED to outline Accounting Services performed at four of the five major DFAS locations, to include the systems used, as well as an approximation of personnel and workload data.  (Note:  Marine Corps Accounting is not included in this RFI).  When systems and processes are discussed in the following Network descriptions it includes legacy, migratory, and personal computer based applications.  Recognize that both systems and processes in some cases are:  1)  shared across all networks; 2) shared across a couple networks; or 3) network unique.  As we move forward in this process, when appropriate, we will issue detailed information that fits under each of the three categories.  However, at this time such detail is not necessary for purposes of the RFI.

<SUBJECT>A--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<DESC>NASA/DFRC is hereby requesting information for potential sources and partners for the design, development and flight testing of a series of High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) Remotely Operated Aircraft (ROA) which can fly at altitudes above 60,000 feet with the potential of remaining aloft for weeks to months.  The vehicles will be designed to carry a variety of payloads of various weights up to several hundred pounds each and with a variety of power requirements.	The vehicles will operate worldwide through mild to moderate weather conditions.  The vehicles will have to operate in restricted airspace, National Air Space and potentially over population centers.  The vehicles will be controlled from a portable control center with a minimal crew for flight control, flight planning and operations of payloads.  Varying degrees of autonomous capabilities and the ability to operate beyond the line of sight from the control center will be developed for the aircraft.   Currently four HALE ROA Performance Objectives have been developed.  Each performance objective addresses a capability set.  Performance Objective #1 will lead to a vehicle that can climb to and sustain an altitude of 60,000í for 7 to 14 continuous days with a payload of 200 kilograms without refueling.  The aircraft will be capable of both station-keeping at a particular longitude and latitude or following specific weather phenomena over very large areas such as the Pacific Ocean. In the course of developing the aircraft designed to meet Performance Objective #1, NASA and its industrial partner(s) will review, clarify and possibly modify the proposed requirements.  The partnership will jointly: develop the design(s) to meet the requirements, model design performance under operational conditions, and execute plans for the development and flight testing of the vehicle.	No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in the CBD and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  Interested parties having the required specialized capabilities to partner with NASA to develop a HALE ROA able to meet Performance Objective #1 should submit a capability statement of 5 pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  Technical questions should be directed to: John Del Frate, HALE ROA Project Manager, phone # (661-276-3704), email: john.h.delfrate@nasa.gov.   NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL PROCUREMENT AND THEREFORE IS NOT A SOLICITATION. THIS NOTICE IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ULTIMATELY ISSUE AN IFB, RFP, RFQ, OR CONTRACT.

<DESC>NA United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Headquarters and the United States Army Field Artillery Center are conducting a Precision Effects Study. The study will determine the current or near-term precision engagement solutions from all pos sible technologies available to the Army and in support of the Army, existing or emerging, to select those that will yield the best pay-off in precision capability of the field artillery and mortar fire support assets available to a maneuver brigade comman der, while concurrently minimizing the logistics burden.  The study will also outline how the Army can expedite getting those solutions to the Soldiers. The purpose is to provide to the Commanding General, TRADOC and then the Department of the Army, by January 2004, solution candidates from a survey of all potential precision enhancements that are in the technology base.  These solution candidates must pro vide fire support capabilities to maneuver commanders across a broad range of situations/conditions that require the delivery of precision effects.  The candidate solutions, derived through coordination with industry and Science and Technology (S&T), must be ready for current or near term fielding (next 24-36 months) and must represent an improvement in engagement efficiency, the ability to meet restrictive ROE requirements on effects, and potential logistical efficiency at a reasonable cost. A list of required capabilities will be provided to interested parities no later than 19 Dec, 2003.  Selected industry and S&T candidate solutions will be evaluated and briefed during the week of 12-16 Jan, 2004 to the Precision Effects Senior Advisory Gro up. Interested companies may submit the following to:  Mr. Tom Hills, hillst@sill.army.mil Company Name Point of Contact Phone Number e-mail address. A Web Site for information updates will be established at:  http://sill-www.army.mil  Additional information will be posted no later than 1 Dec, 2003.

<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Defense Contracting Command √¢¬Ä¬ì Washington (DCC-W) intends to award a competitive Small Business Set-Aside contract for the requirement outlined below.  The contract type is Time and Materi al.  The Statement of Work is as follows:  1.0  Organization. Defense Procurement & Acquisition Policy  1.1  Background  and Objective  Background: Federal procurement increasingly involves contracting for services. The DoD currently spends more than half of its procurement dollars acquiring a variety of services.  That trend is expected to continue for the next several years.  It is imperative that the Department spend its limited resources in the most effective manner possible.  To that end, the Deputy Se cretary of Defense on February 6, 2003 issued a memorandum requiring a commercial-like joint level √¢¬Ä¬úspend analysis√¢¬Ä¬ù.   The memorandum authorized OUSD(AT&L) to form a Spend Analysis Integrated Process Team (SAIPT) to oversee the activity.  The SAI PT, with the support of a commercial contractor experienced in this field, conducted a high level spend analysis and identified service commodity categories that may offer opportunities for cost savings and/or increased effectiveness.  The next step is for  the SAIPT to identify and establish commodity group (CG) teams, formed from service/agency members experienced in the particular service commodity, to further analyze the opportunities and develop joint level written acquisition strategies.   1.1.2	Objective:  Identify opportunities to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of DoD procurement through the identification and implementation of strategic acquisition opportunities across the DoD as follows:  a.  Assist DPAP in the development of a Department-wide concept of operations.  b. Structure and implement the commodity group teams.  c.  Facilitate and train team members.  d. Develop procurement strategies for commodity groups.  e. Prepare written business case analyses.  2.1 Statement of W ork.  The contractor will develop the following:  a.  Department-wide concept of operations.   Prepare a Department-wide concept of operations for the performance of strategic sourcing at the enterprise-wide level.

The Concept of Operation shall b e developed specific to the Department of Defense considering its size, management structure, organizational and component missions, policies and procedures including statutory and regulatory acquisition requirements.  The Concept of Operations shall provi de the structure upon which the Department can build a strategic sourcing program.  b. Structure, implement and facilitate commodity group teams.   Provide recommendations on the establishment of specific commodity teams as identified by the COR.  The Cont ractor shall provide recommendations pertaining to personnel requirements, team charters, performance timelines, analytical processes, market analysis techniques and results, industry best practices, and analytical data requirements.  The Contractor shall facilitate commodity team meetings providing guidance and training at meetings.  The Contractor shall monitor the progress of each commodity team and provide recommended a ctions as necessary to commodity team leaders.  The Contractor shall provide feedback to the COR via the monthly progress report including a discussion of team weaknesses and areas requiring strengthening.  Commodity teams shall develop broad based inputs for the Contractor to utilize in the preparation of acquisition strategies/business cases in task √¢¬Ä¬úc√¢¬Ä¬ù below.  c. Prepare written Acquisition Strategies/Business Cases utilizing commodity team assessments for each commodity group.   Acquisition St rategies/Business Cases shall follow the format delineated in the May 31, 2002 OUSD(AT&L) memo, Review of Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition of Services, to support a pilot program for the acquisition of services.  The Acquisition Strategies/Business Cases shall delineate the metrics and performance measures to be utilized to measure changes in costs, processes, and management sufficient to provide visibility into the level of success of the acquisition strategy.  Draft Acquisition Strategies/Business Cases shall be submitted to the commodity team leader within 30 calendar days of completion of the commodity team efforts and receipt of the strategy/business case inputs developed in task √¢¬Ä¬úb√¢¬Ä¬ù above.  The commodity team leader shall provide feedb ack with requested changes within 15 calendar days.  The Contractor shall provide the final strategy/business case within 10 calendar days of receipt of the commodity team feedback.  d. Statistical Analysis.   Format and normalize raw government furnished acquisition data for commodity teams to analyze and provide ad-hoc statistical analysis of such data when requested by the COR.  e. Market Analysis. Provide specific commodity group market analyses when requested by the COR for use by commodity teams in th e preparation of acquisition strategy documentation.    Deliverables.  All deliverables must meet professional standards and requirements set forth in contractual documentation.  The contractor is responsible for delivering all contract line and end items specified.  The contractor will request additional infor mation from the DoD COR as necessary.  All written deliverables shall be in MS Word format and submitted electronically to the COR and commodity team leaders. Deliverables: Department Concept of Operations (Due: 90 Days After Contract Award), Monthly Progr ess Report (Due: NLT 5th Business Day of Following Month), Acquisition Strategy/Business Case (Due:	Draft: NLT 30 calendar days of receipt of commodity team inputs), Final: Within 10 calendar days of receipt of commodity team feedback from draft submission .

The government has the right to reject or accept a report after a technical review meeting between the contractor and the COR.    Duration of Task.  The duration of the project will be from the date of award through September 30, 2004.  The evaluation criteria is as follows:  Factor 1.  Technical Capability/Understanding of the Requirements.  The Offeror's understanding of the specific requirements and the overall scope of work required; and the Offeror's technical capability, with particular emphasis on the use of proposed personnel.  The Government will evaluate the offer's comprehensive approach, detailed work plan, and proposed staffing to accomplish each task.  This factor will be evaluated in terms of comprehension and feasibility.  The Government will evaluate the offer's explanation of how each task is to be done, to include estimate of total staff hours required and reasonableness of timetable.  Credit will be given for innovations where considered appropriate and feasible for the proposed area of application.  This section will show the offer's complete understanding of the project.

<CONTACT>Charlene G. Jeong, 404-464-2517
<DESC>NA On 1 October 2002, the Army mandated the use of a group of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) for the purchase of office products.  The primary goals of this BPA initiative were to ensure that office product purchases were in compliance with the statutory p references afforded to products manufactured under the Javits-Wagner-O√¢¬Ä¬ôDay (JWOD) Act and to capture economies of scale.  The purpose of this Solicitation notice is to announce the issuance of the Request for Quotes (RFQ) of Army BPAs for office produ cts. Army Contracting Agency, Southern Region Contracting Center - East intends to procure office products through the issuance of Blanket Purchase Agreements under GSA Federal Supply Schedules.  RFQ issuance will be made through GSA E-Buy.  The GSA E-Buy web a ddress is: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/content/offerings_content.jsp?contentOID=116555&contentType=1004&P=1&S=1.  Interested vendors shall submit their submissions via electronic means in GSA E-Buy.  No hard copy submissions will be accepted.  Submissions fr om responsible vendors will be considered.  RFQ submission closing date will be listed in GSA E-Buy.  No hard copy request for quotes (RFQ) will be made available.  An Industry Day Conference will be scheduled by 15  December 2003.  Vendors should express their interest in attending via e-mail to POC listed herein.  Vendors will be notified through GSA E-Buy of the exact date, time, location, and agenda.  The Homepage Address for all Army BPAs status/updates is:  http://www.forscom.army.mil/aacc/Army_BPA/BP A_default.htm.  All CONUS Army users are now required to purchase office products through the Army BPAs.  However, Army installations with an onsite self-service supply store may use this source to obtain JWOD office products.  To the maximum extent practi cable, BPA purchases must be made through the DoD E-Mall at https://emall.prod.dodonline.net/scripts/emLogon.asp.   Army customers place orders using the Government-wide Purchase Card Vendors will be requested to submit their submissions for office products and Toner/Inkjet that meet the criteria stated in the RFQ.  The vendor will be required to provide the following information in their RFQs: pricing information; capability and capaci ty data; past performance; a willingness to accept minimum order qty of $25.00, possess a GSA contract, show certification as an authorized JWOD distributor, demonstrate E-Commerce capability.  The Government will not require Level 3 data from vendors, but  will require data from vendors√¢¬Ä¬ô packing list with shipments, purchases by customer or zip code, and similar data readily available from vendors√¢¬Ä¬ô automated systems and required for EMALL operations.  In order to avoid confusing Government cardhol ders, the BPA customers, the Army requires an order to be charged in total regardless of whether partial shipments are made.  In order to maximize small business participation, we are seeking qualified small businesses, including consortiums and teams. The  Army expects that vendors will offer additional pricing discounts beyond their GSA FSS pricing, demonstrate a willingness to provide shipment within 24 hrs. with 2-day delivery, and develop and offer a Customer Management Program.   One of the major goals of the Army Office Products BPAs is to leverage the Army√¢¬Ä¬ôs buying power based on economies of scale.
