<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). NHTSA's mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs. The agency develops, promotes and implements effective educational, engineering and enforcement programs with the goal of ending preventable tragedies and reducing economic costs associated with vehicle use and highway travel.</span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">The NHTSA Human Factors/Engineering Integration Division manages research, which explores how to improve driver performance and reduce unsafe behaviors. An additional focus is to evaluate driver's capabilities to benefit from existing or new in-vehicle technologies. The research supports Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), safety defects investigations, consumer information, and advancement of knowledge about driver behaviors and performance that can be applied to the development of vehicle technologies that are compatible with driver capabilities and limitations. </span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">This interaction between the driver and the vehicle occurs through operation of controls, reading displays, interpreting signal light cues from other vehicles, responding to warnings and alerts from crash avoidance systems, and observing roadway events through direct and indirect visibility systems (i.e., windows and mirrors). These interactions define the interfaces between the driver and the vehicle. The manner in which these interfaces are designed and implemented can influence the ability of drivers to accurately sense, understand, and respond to potential traffic conflicts. An interface design that is not matched to the capabilities of the driving population can cause driver errors, distraction, slow response, misperception, and other problems that can contribute to crash causation. </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">To meet NHTSA's agency, and the Human Factors/Engineering Integration Division mission objectives, the Engineering Integration Division is seeking innovation and partner solutions for one or more multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Synopsis</span></strong></p>
<p>This synopsis, in accordance with FAR 5.203(a), issues a 15 day public notification prior to the issuance of a solicitation DTNH2217R0003. NHTSA intends to issue a solicitation for a <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Full and Open Competition</strong> to document studies and perform experiments in a laboratory setting for the Crash Avoidance Human Factors Research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Type</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;NTHSA intends to award a multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract whereby a combination of Cost (No Fee), Cost Sharing, and Cost Plus Fixed Fee Task Orders may be issued, in accordance with FAR 16.505. The applicable NAICS code and size standard for this acquisition are as follows:</p>

<p>The anticipated period of performance is 60 months inclusive of option periods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The solicitation will be issued on or about December 13, 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="COLOR: black">Scope of Work</span></span></strong></p>
<p>The objective of this Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract is to provide NHTSA with the capability to award Task Orders that require a range of research skills that could be called into use to quickly plan, conduct, and document studies which evaluate how various vehicle-based systems affect driver behavior and performance using experiments in a laboratory setting, test track, or on public roads. The human factors tests and experiments performed under this IDIQ Contract will provide the support needed by NHTSA to:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />This acquisition is conducted as non-competitive for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the FAR Subpart 13 and the authority of 41 U.S.C. 1901 and the statutory authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).</p>
<p>Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b) the rationale for the brand name justification is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10--Market Research.

 SIMILARLY SITUATED ENTITY- The term `similarly situated entity' means a subcontractor that--
(A) if a subcontractor for a small business concern, is a small business concern;
(B) if a subcontractor for a small business concern eligible to receive contracts under section 8(a), is such a concern;

DESCRIPTION/SCOPE OF WORK:  The National Park Service, Olympic National Park (OLYM), has a requirement for providing pasture, shelter, food, water, and care for our park mules, as follows:
(1) At least 30 to 35 acres of dry pasture and shelter from the weather. Shelter shall consist of heavy tree cover and/or barn, or other structure adequate to provide covered protection.
(2) A constant source of clean water.
(3) An adequate supply of stored hay to feed 23 to 30 mules during times when pasture must be supplemented such as inclement weather or temperature.
(4) Make daily welfare checks for each mule and immediately notify the Contracting OfficerÂ¿s Representative (COR) in the event of injuries, accidents or health issues.
(5) Fencing with secure gates so that third parties cannot gain access through a fence or gate, protecting the park-owned mules from being exposed to outside stock.  
(6) Vendor shall be located within 1/2 hour drive of Port Angeles, Washington. The reason for the close proximity to Port Angeles is to ensure that the Olympic National Park trail crew staff can make routine trips to the contractorÂ¿s land for attending to the mules, such as trimming feet, responding to reported illness or injury, and/or addressing any other problems the contractor has notified COR about, as well as ensure mules are being cared for in the manner described above with regards to food, water, and general welfare.

PERIODS OF PERFORMANCE includes one base year and the option for exercising up to four option years, as listed below. Note that while the performance period for each year starts November 1st, this is an estimated date that the mules will be hauled to vendor's pasture. Actual date will be arranged with vendor immediately after award for the base year, and then for each option year exercised. Actual date mules are hauled may be within a few days before or after November 1st.  Same is true for the end of the performance periods for when mules will be picked up and hauled back to the park. The actual date will be arranged with vendor, and may fall within a few days before or after March 31st.
(a) Base Year: November 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017 
(b) Option Year One: November 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. 
(c) Option Year Two: November 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019

<DESC>Southern Africa Mission Support (SAMS) activity.  

The United States Government, represented by the U.S Agency for International Development in Southern Africa (USAID/Southern Africa), intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for an anticipated award of a contract for the implementation of the Southern Africa Mission Support (SAMS) activity.

Objectives: 
The overall objective for the contract is to provide program, administrative, financial management and acquisition and assistance support services to USAIDâ€™s Missions and offices in the Southern Africa region, including the Power Africa Coordinatorâ€™s Office.

The objective of the Southern Africa Mission Support (SAMS) contract is to provide services to USAIDâ€™s Missions and offices in the Southern African region, including the Power Africa office, in the areas of program support, administrative, financial management and acquisition and assistance services when needed to ensure USAIDâ€™s continuing ability to successfully implement its development assistance activities in the region.  It is envisioned that this will be accomplished through the following four tasks:

Task 1:		Program Support Services  

Task 2:  	Administrative Support Services

Task 3:  	Financial Management Services

Task 4: 	Acquisition and Assistance Services

A draft copy of the Statement of Work is attached for reference.  The finalized Statement of Work will be included as part of the RFP package, if/when an RFP is eventually published.  The anticipated period of performance for this activity is five (5) years from the date of award, subject to the availability of funds.  

This procurement is being conducted as a total small business set-aside in accordance with Part 19.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services).

The purpose of this notice is to comply with the synopses and pre-solicitation notice requirements of FAR 5.2 Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions.  Any solicitation resulting from this notice will be handled in accordance with FAR 5.102(d); therefore, availability of any resulting solicitation package may be limited to this electronic medium.

In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed. 

All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package, which will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov and on the FedConnect web site at www.fedconnect.net.

<DESC>HSCGG1-17-B-PFA005 <br />ISSUE DATE: 1 NOVEMBER 2016
<p>Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to remove existing circuit breakers and remanufacture and re-install the circuit breakers for the Main Distribution Switchgear in Smith Hall.</p>
<p>The project scope includes all labor, materials, equipment, transportation, supervision and disposal required to remove, remanufacture and replace rack-out circuit breakers in the 480V Main Distribution Switchgear, at Smith Hall. The project consists of all work necessary to remove and remanufacture (15) FM-25 600A frame rack-out circuit breaker, (3) FP-50 1600A frame rack-out circuit breakers and (1) 4000A frame rack-out circuit breaker residing in the 4000A Main Distribution Switchgear for Smith Hall. The rack-out circuit breakers are dated around 1972 and are in need of maintenance. It has been noted that the circuit breakers won't trip when manually released and are not likely to charge the springs for breaker closing. Smith Hall is the science building at the USCG Academy. The electrical replacements will directly impact ongoing scientific experiments. Therefore, power outages are to be limited in duration during the replacement process. Replacement work is to take place during weekends or during after hour periods and must be completed prior to normal working hours (M-F: 0730-1600). The breakers shall be installed by licensed electricians, those qualified to perform power equipment replacement work and familiar with installing and operating draw-out circuit breakers.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Breaker installation shall take place during off-hours and weekends so as not to disturb class work, labs and research. Estimated period of performance is a total of 19 weeks (including submittal time, lead time and install time), and is based on removal and installation of 5 breakers per visit with an approximate lead time of 3 weeks for breaker refurnishing. All work shall be completed no later than 21 April 2017.</p>
<p>The estimated value of the procurement is between $150,000 and $250,000.00. Solicitation packages will be available on or about 1 November 2016. The tentative date set for receipt of bids is scheduled for 1 December 2016 at 2:00 pm. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238210 Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors, with a small business size standard of $15 Million. This acquisition is issued pursuant to FAR Part 14 and is 100% Set-Aside for Small Business concerns.

<DESC>Request For Interested (RFI) Manufacturers<br />WXR-700 Receiver Transmitter (RT)
<p><br />FROM: ANTHONY D. SIMMONS 407 SCMS/GULBB</p>
<p>TO: DLA Aviation Procurement Operations at Warner Robins (SPRWA1)</p>
<p>LOCATION: Robins AFB, GA 31098-1813</p>
<p>FBO Post Title: Request for Interested Manufacturers for NSN 5841-01-432-3798, Receiver Transmitter (RT)</p>
<p>SUBJECT:</p>
<p>Market research is being conducted for PR FD2060-17-00071-00 to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification and production of the WXR-700 Receiver Transmitter (RT); National Stock Number (NSN) 5841-01-432-3798, Manufacturer CAGE/Part Number (P/N): (13499/622-5132-401).</p>
<p>ITEM DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Radio Receiver functions as a component of the Weather Radar (WXR-700) System. The solid state Color Weather Radar System (WXR) operates in the X-band frequency range. The WXR provides weather information to assist in hazardous weather condition detection and avoidance. Ground mapping capability provides an aid to navigation. The WXR R/T radiates 150 watts of peak power at 9.33 GHz then receives reflected return signals from precipitation, ground terrain, or aircraft (skin paint) targets depending upon the mode of operation selected. Receive circuits process the return signals into display video. In addition to normal weather detection, the RT can detect turbulence and wind shear events. The Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) varies from 180 Pulses Per Second (PPS) in Weather Mode to 1446 PPS during Turbulence Detection. This buy is intended to provide the assets necessary to support the current mission requirement of the KC-135 aircraft.</p>
<p>Impediment to Competition:</p>
<p>Rockwell Collins (CAGE 13499) was identified as the sole source of supply on previous buy effort. The asset has been assigned Acquisition Method Code (AMC)/Acquisition Method Suffix Code (AMSC) 3P: Items screened and found to be procured from the actual manufacturer or vendor, including a prime contractor who is the actual manufacturer/ Rights to use data legally unavailable. The Government does not own any data, drawings, schematics, or any other releasable technical data in support of this requirement. As a result, Rockwell Collins Inc. is the only known source with adequate knowledge of the RT performance requirements and possession of the required technical data and capabilities needed to produce this item and ensure compatibility of the equipment.</p>
<p><br />INTEREST</p>
<p>The DLA/AWB Contracting Office intends to award a sole source contract to Rockwell Collins Inc. for the manufacture of the RT, NSN 5841-01-432-3798 in support of KC-135 mission operations. Other interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than 28 Oct 2016 by emailing Mr. Anthony D. Simmons anthony.simmons.12@us.af.mil and/or dla.dlr.proc@us.af.mil. The Government intends to procure these items using Other Than Full and Open Competition as prescribed by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>This sources sought synopsis is for informational purposes only. This is not a request for proposal. It does not constitute a solicitation, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the government. Responses in any form are not offers, and the government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by respondents to this technical description is strictly voluntary.</p>

<p>PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential repair sources for the requirements identified below and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited.</p>
<p>The 422nd Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the repair of the NSN(s) listed below. The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an Industry Day and/or pre-solicitation Conference. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. No qualification requirements or Technical Orders exist. Consequently, potential sources for this requirement would typically be companies who have a license or agreement with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Northrop Grumman Technical Services CAGE Code 0JRC1 to complete the work described, including military specific modifications.</p>
<p>The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and provide the requested information in Part I and Part II (see attachment).</p>

<DESC>The 38th Contracting Squadron (38 CONS) intends to issue a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, Indefinite Delivery /Indefinite Quantity, Single Award Task Order Contract with Cost Reimbursable line items to a single source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, no later than 01 December 2016. The period of performance will be from 01 December 2016 to 30 November 2017.<br /><br />The prospective contractor shall provide highly specialized technical services required to accomplish the 92 Cyberspace Operations Squadron (COS) mission. The services to be acquired are management, engineering and technical support services required to support the establishment, maintenance, and evolution of the 92 COS cyber assessment program and the execution of the assessments defined by this program as follows:
<p>a) Mission Support: Provide the technical support necessary to baseline, evolve and sustain the 92 COS infrastructure (approximately 10 networks), data, and processes. Approximately $500K in commodities will be acquired to sustain 92 COS infrastructure.</p>
<p>b) Training and Standardization Evaluation Support: Provide the technical support necessary to train and certify approximately 300+ personnel to execute assessments.</p>
<p>c) Assessment Operations: Provide the technical support necessary to baseline, evolve, sustain, and execute approximately 45+ Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessments. Approximately $200 thousand in travel expenses will be acquired to support project, and tasking.</p>
<p>38 CONS intends to award this requirement as a sole source to Engility (doing business as TASC) since the services are follow-on from a current contract award (Cyber Assessment and Engineering Technical Services (CAETS). Awarding to another source would result in both substantial duplication of costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition for this effort and unacceptable delays in service during the time required to issue a new competitive contract.</p>
<p>The Government believes that Engility is the only contractor that is highly-trained and well experienced with proven capabilities to augment military and civilian cyber forces to meet initial operating capability levels and meet full operational capabilities no later than 01 December 2016. Engility has the only qualified Cyber Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) and Cyber Protection Team (CPT) mission qualified operators for the 92 COS Cyber Vulnerability Assessment/Hunt (CVA/H) weapon system. Additionally, the Government believes that no other contractor has time to obtain the proper clearances and certifications no later than 01 December 2016. The Cyber Operations mission requires a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearance level.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541512 Computer Systems Design Services. This notice of intent/sources sought synopsis is not a request for proposals or quotes; however, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within seven (7) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses must be submitted to the Government point of contact at the email address shown below. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS DESIRES TO LEASE SPACE

The Government is seeking to lease sufficient rentable square footage to yield approximately 6500 usable square feet within the 18th Congressional District, geographical area encompassing the City of Port Jervis, New York 12771 for use as a Community Based Outpatient Clinic. 

The delineated area is as follows:

The delineated area shall be from the corner of Allen St and West Main St to end of Allen St, (North) to Entrance/Exit ramp on I-84, (South) to corner of E. Main St and Kingston Ave (North-East) to Vans Beach Rd (East) and back to Allen Street. See delineated diagram attached.

The space must be handicapped accessible, ADA compliant, and can be provided by new construction or modification of an existing space. If not a new building, the space offered shall be in a building that has undergone, or will complete by occupancy, modernization or adaptive reuse for the Space with modern conveniences.

The space must be contiguous, on no more than one floor (ground floor preferable) and must meet or be able to meet the Department of Veterans Affairs Life Safety codes and other applicable regulations.  A 10 year lease (5 years firm) will be considered.  The VA seeks a modified gross lease that includes, but not limited to the following:

Insurance					Lawn sprinkler

*VA will be responsible for its own janitorial/housekeeping services for the internal space it occupies*

Only space that is identified as economically advantageous to the Government will be considered relative to relocation, potential build out and/or rent. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime. A cost comparison will be performed in relation to the expenses incurred at the current location. 

A market survey of the properties offered for lease will be conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs. All interested offerors (owners, brokers, or their legal representatives) must provide written acknowledgement NO LATER THAN Wednesday, November 2, 2016; 4:30pm EST.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />USPFO for Idaho, Purchasing and Contracting
<p>1.0	Description</p>
<p>1.1 The Idaho National Guard USPFO for Idaho Purchasing and Contracting Department in support of the Idaho Army National Guard is seeking information from interested contractors of their ability to propose on an IDIQ contract for portable sanitation at Idaho National Guard training sites.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  The intent is to obtain information from prospective offerors regarding commercial practices for pricing portable toilets, hand wash stations, grey water removal, grey water storage, and portable shower facility or servicing of existing portable shower facilities to insure practices are not inconsistent with commercial practices.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0	Background</p>
<p>Acquisition Background Purpose: The Idaho National Guard operates many training areas within the Orchard Range Training Complex.  The Orchard Combat Training Center(OCTC) supports units from around the nation in preparing for deployments or for reserve units to conduct their annual training.  Additionally, many civilian and federal agencies use this complex.  In order to facilitate a more user friendly environment and decrease administrative workload, it is in the best interest of the Idaho Army National Guard to establish and IDIQ with a local contractor to supply portable sanitation services.  During FY16, over 90,000 individuals from Federal Agencies utilized the range complex.  These units ranged in size from 130 individuals to over 4000 individuals.  While facilities exist throughout the range, often these sanitary facilities are inadequate for large units.  Services often used by units include portable toilets, hand washing stations, grey water temporary storage/removal, and portable shower systems.  As the usage of the OCTC increases it is becoming increasingly important that simplified methods for acquiring services are available to units using this site.</p>
<p>Description of the Service: The requirement includes provision of portable toilets, handwashing stations, grey water storage and removal, and portable shower trailers.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that equipment is delivered to the correct locations at the agreed upon time for all task orders.  Contractor will perform emptying and cleaning of all portable toilet stations and will refill hand wash stations with necessary soaps and consumables.  Contractor will be responsible for all routine maintenance for provided units.  It is the contractor's responsibility to ensure that portable toilets are secured in case of high winds.  No Government Furnished Property or Equipment is expected to be provided with this requirement.  Contractor may be required to hook up to government mess systems to remove grey water.  Those connection types would be clarified in a possible RFQ.  Contractor will need to ensure that drivers can navigate by map using improved unpaved roads with limited signage.</p>
<p>2.2 Delivery Period: (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods<br />***Note base year and options are 12 months in duration***</p>
<p>3.0	Requested Information to support a monthly pickup schedule incorporating a fully burdened rate per container</p>
<p>1) What type of technical information along with the PWS would you like to see with a potential solicitation to support this requirement?</p>
<p>2) Contract Content/Structure: The Government anticipates structuring the contract for pricing and payment according to a per Delivery Order basis.  The Government will provide a Not To Exceed personnel usage per year in addition to a minimum delivery quantity.  The Government anticipates structuring the contract for pricing and payment according to a monthly pick-up schedule. The potential Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure will include separate CLINs for portable toilets, hand wash stations, grey water removal, grey water storage, and portable shower facility or servicing of existing portable shower facilities.  The Government is seeking suggestions or comments on the anticipated CLIN structure to include how the potential CLIN structure compares to customary commercial practices, the impacts of pricing this potential CLIN structure, and any other information necessary for Contractors to provide fair and reasonable pricing for this potential CLIN structure.  Please provide feedback that will assist the Government to better develop the CLIN structure.</p>
<p>3). The Government will provide detailed maps and Points of Contact.  What other information would be helpful to view in the solicitation?</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.
<p>Contracting Office Address:</p>
<p>Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition<br />Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Building 301, Room B129, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899-1640</p>
<p>The Nanophotonics Laboratory in CNST's Nanofabrication Research Group performs spectroscopy of nanophotonic devices in which a tunable laser is swept in wavelength, its output is sent into the device, and the signal exiting the device is recorded with an analog photodetector.  For devices currently being fabricated and measured, a 1050 nm continuously tunable laser is needed.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is for one (1) 1050 nm continuously tunable laser, with the following characteristics.</p>
<p>1)	To determine the position of spectral resonances which can appear at any location within the laser's tuning range, the laser must be continuously tunable and mode-hop-free</p>
<p>2)	The devices being measured have resonances that appear within a broad range of wavelengths around 1050 nm.  Thus a wavelength tuning range between 1020 nm and 1070 nm is required, with larger tuning ranges given stronger consideration.</p>
<p>3)	Motorized coarse scanning and fine piezo scanning are required for swept wavelength spectroscopy measurement.  High resolution in the piezo scan is needed to resolve resonances adequately</p>
<p>4)	External control of the laser piezo scan is needed to lock the laser to spectral resonances</p>
<p>5)	The laser linewidth must be sufficiently narrow (&lt;100 kHz) to limit laser noise influence on measurements.  The laser must have limited drift (&lt;5 MHz) to enable accurate measurements over typical measurement periods (e.g., 60 s)</p>
<p>6)	Free-space output power in excess of 50 mW is needed to enable measurements given the potential losses in the optical path.  This output power must not degrade by more than a factor of 2 across the entire tuning range (i.e., the power must be above 25 mW everywhere)</p>
<p>7)	60 dB of isolation is needed to protect the laser from reflections</p>
<p>8)	Our measurement setups generally utilize fiber optics, so the laser must come with a setup for coupling light into either standard single mode fiber or polarization maintaining fiber, with the output being an FC/APC fiber pigtail or connector.  To ensure that we have enough optical power available for the experiments, we require at least 40% coupling efficiency into the fiber</p>
<p>9)	Computer control is necessary, either through GPIB or some equivalent approach</p>
<p>10)	All software and control electronics needed to run the system need to be included, that is, we need to be able to run the laser without additional equipment required.</p>
<p>11)	Additional software or hardware that the vendor can provide to enable swept-wavelength spectroscopy experiments would be valuable and will be given stronger consideration</p>
<p><br />Additionally, the following terms shall be met:</p>
<p>DELIVERY:  The 1050 nm continuously tunable laser must be received no later than12 weeks after award of the contract.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516 as those domestic sources having 1000 employees or less.  Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that can provide 1050 nm continuously tunable laser that meets the stated requirements are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to  forest.crumpler@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. <br />2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). <br />3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. <br />4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to forest.crumpler@nist.gov is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). <br />5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement, for market survey information only, to be used for preliminary acquisition planning purposes. No proposals are being requested and none will be accepted in response to this synopsis.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Market Research and Sources Sought Notice is to determine if there are adequate contractors to provide adequate competition to compete and perform a firm fixed price construction type contract for A Design-Bid-Build project to demolish and reconstruct a concrete rolling gate foundation and main line track near Riverside, Missouri.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought or Request for Information is for planning purposes only as defined by FAR 15.201. The purpose of the posting is to establish interest and allow industry to provide comments on the attached plans and specifications. The notice does not constitute a Request for Quote, Request for Proposal, Invitational for Bid or a promise the aforementioned will be issued in the future. Furthermore, it does not commit the Government to contract for any service or supplies. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.</p>
<p>A brief synopsis of the proposed contract is as follows:</p>
<p>A foundation deficiency exists at Rolling Gate Closure Gap Q1 located at Levee Station QL 12+15 of the Quindaro System of MRLS L-385. The gap through the levee provides access for the Burlington Northern Sant&eacute; Fe (BNSF) Railway lines and the Inter Continental Engineering-Manufacturing Corporation (Intercon) paved access. Crossings are skewed with the flood control works alignment.</p>
<p>The rolling gate closure gap structure is pile supported and the opening is 66-feet wide. Railway line bearing ranges from flexible wood ties, ballast, and soil foundation to rigid steel bearing plates within the slots of the pile supported concrete panels. The flexible rails transitioning to a rigid pile cap is causing rail deflections that are scarring and damaging the concrete panels and creating ongoing maintenance and repair at the crossings.</p>
<p>The dynamic action of the daily train traffic over a system that abruptly transitions from a flexible to a rigid system creates aggressive settlement within the flexible system and a hammering action at the bearing plates that degrades the supporting concrete. These are heavily trafficked mainline rails for Burlington Northern Sant&eacute; Fe Railroad. As a result of the deterioration of the track support, the track elevation with respect to the rolling gate foundation is creating a clearance issue between the trains and the foundation which poses an increased risk of train derailment.<br /><br />The scope of this construction project is to demolish the existing rail and rolling gate concrete foundation within the railroad right away enough to install a fully ballasted railroad section. At the same time, a structural system must be pre-fabricated and installed that will allow for subsurface stop logs to be installed as necessary. On top of the subsurface stop logs, a rail system will be installed upon which the existing rolling gate will be expected to roll.</p>
<p>The rolling gate rail system runs at a skewed angle to the BNSF main line tracks and can only be installed when the mainline tracks are removed. Demolition to the existing permanent concrete crossing pads that are roughly 3 ft thick 10 ft wide, and 15ft long will be required. The contractor will fabricate/supply the specified stop logs, associated precast abutments and support system and the rolling gate rail system. They will be expected to fully operate the existing rolling gate after construction by closing the gate across the BNSF ROW.</p>
<p>The contractor will coordinate extensively with BNSF and will have only a limited window (10 to 15 hours) to work within the railroad Right-of-Way without train traffic. Some construction may have to take place with live railway traffic. BNSF will be responsible for removal and installation of their main line rails and ballast and will be working closely with the contractor during the project. The contractor will be responsible for everything else.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this acquisition is 237990. Small Business size is $36.5M.</p>
<p><br />The magnitude of this project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.</p>
<p>The following information is requested in this Sources Sought / Request for Information (SS/RFI):</p>
<p>1. Firm's name, addresses, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address;<br />2. Firm's interest in providing a proposal or bid on the pending solicitations once issued;<br />3.

<DESC>SUBJECT: W912DS-17-S-0001 Sources Sought Notice for Sole Source Market Research for the Construction of NCO Academy Complex, Fort Drum, New York
<p>Description:</p>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE FOR SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE IS NO BID PACKAGE, SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PROCUREMENT COMMITMENT BY THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. RESPONSE IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY; NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. THE GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR OR SUFFER ANY CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY IMPROPERLY IDENTIFIED INFORMATION.</p>
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is that the New York District plans to solicit and award a Best Value Trade Off Request for Proposal for a Construction Project for the NCO Academy Complex, Fort Drum, New York in FY17.</p>
<p>1. This notification serves three (3) purposes:</p>
<p>A. To notify potential bidders of the Governments intent to solicit a brand name(s) only component for this project.</p>
<p>B. To identify potential sources that can provide an equivalent to the brand name only item.</p>
<p>C. Notification of the Army's intent to solicit brand name components as described below.</p>
<p>2. The items described below, under summary of requirements, are embedded in the construction project. The project will be issued competitively. Only the components described below will be sole source, if no other sources are identified that can provide an equivalent system. In the event no equivalent sources are found the brand name only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval for sole sourcing. Supplies of the brand name component will be provided directly to the Contractor(s) and not to the Government.</p>
<p>3. Summary of Requirements:</p>
<p>A. Fire Alarm System manufactured by Honeywell Fire-Lite and Fire Alarm Transmitter by Monaco as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP): This project will involve the installation of one new Fire Alarm Control Panel. This piece of equipment is required to control the sequence of operations of the fire alarm devices and provide a display of the inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>&bull; Fire Alarm Devices: Fire alarm devices such as visual notification appliances (strobes), audible notification appliances (speakers), initiating devices (e.g. manual pull stations, smoke detectors, duct smoke detectors, and monitor modules), and control devices (e.g. control modules) will be required for this project. These devices must all be compatible with the fire alarm control panel (FACP) provided by the same manufacturer in order to send and receive addressable signals to/from the FACP.</p>
<p>&bull; Fire Alarm Transmitter: This project will involve the installation of one new Monaco fire alarm radio transmitter. These transmitters are required to be compatible with the existing Fort Drum alarm receiving station, which is a Monaco system. Using another product would result in the inability to transmit fire alarm signals to emergency services. In order to perform this scope of work, materials and services must be purchased from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>This project will involve the installation of a new fire alarm system. Fire alarm system up-time and reliability are critically important factors in ensuring a safe environment for building occupants. Effective fire alarm systems will detect fires quickly and alert occupants effectively so they have adequate time to exit the building safely. The high casualty counts of many terrible fires in history could have been reduced or eliminated by using reliable and effective modern fire detection and alarm systems. In order to maximize reliability, a property manager such as Fort Drum DPW must perform frequent inspections, routine maintenance, and expedient repairs when defects or failures are identified. To this end, Fort Drum DPW has a dedicated service contract to maintain and repair fire alarm systems on post.</p>
<p>Modern fire alarm systems - called &lsquo;analog addressable' systems - utilize microprocessor-based control panels and devices. The extent to which these panels and systems should be considered &lsquo;proprietary' varies across manufacturers. All of them utilize a number of features that are proprietary, such as: hardware, firmware (operating systems), software, programming tools and utilities, and built-in security features designed to restrict access to only technicians deemed qualified by that panel's manufacturer. Additionally, fire alarm devices that connect to the control panel have to be able to communicate with the panel. This communication between devices and panels is accomplished through a proprietary multiplex signal format in such a way that a fire alarm device will not function properly unless they are connected to the manufacturer make/model panels for which they were intended. Parts, therefore, are often not interchangeable between system makes and models.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish a basic repair task, such as replacement of a defective fire alarm device, a technician must order a replacement part from the manufacturer, access the control panel's software system to remove the old device software address, add the new device software address in its place, apply the appropriate sequence of operations, and program the correct signal to report to the Fire Department's alarm receiving station. The extent to which that system is &lsquo;proprietary' determines the difficulty of each of these steps. If a system is &lsquo;highly proprietary' the task will be impossible without hiring the manufacturer themselves.</p>
<p>Due to differences in business strategies, some fire alarm system manufacturers are &lsquo;more proprietary' than others. Some of the &lsquo;most proprietary' manufacturers, such as Simplex and Siemens, only permit in-company technicians to perform basic repair tasks on their systems. These companies will not grant outside technicians security access to their panels for software changes, and they will not hand over the required software tools and utilities. These prohibitions are promulgated by a business strategy that is geared towards guaranteeing a high standard of quality by using only factory-employed technicians. If such a system requires repair on Fort Drum, the Drum technicians will not be able to repair the system themselves. Instead, they will have to contact the manufacturer for the repair. If the cost of this repair exceeds the Drum DPW credit card limit, then a new contract will have to be awarded to perform the system repair, which can be a slow process. Recently, the lengthy process has resulted in a non-functional fire alarm system in an occupied building for multiple months. When a fire alarm system is down for an extended time it imposes an extraordinary burden on the Drum DPW, Fire Department, and Building Tenant, who will have to decide whether or not to relocate the occupants or impose a heightened fire safety strategy during occupied hours (such as a mandatory fire watch).</p>
<p>Other fire alarm system manufacturers can be considered &lsquo;less proprietary' because they employ a business strategy that allows customers much more flexibility of choice. Honeywell, for instance, manufactures a fire alarm system that almost every fire alarm company can install, maintain, and repair. Honeywell offers a two-day factory training to any fire alarm technician that wishes to attend. At the conclusion of this training the technician is granted a certificate and the ability to work on Honeywell systems. Control panels manufactured by Honeywell utilize security features that permit any factory-trained fire alarm service providers to access the control panel software tools, enabling them to perform all of the maintenance and repair functions without having to directly enlist the services of the manufacturer. Installation, maintenance, and repair services for these four systems can therefore be openly competed among a large number of qualified Contractors.</p>
<p>Fort Drum has requested that USACE specify fire alarm systems manufactured by Honeywell and transmitters manufactured by Monaco for all current and future projects. The Fort Drum DPW contract technicians can maintain, repair, and expand these systems as needed. In the event that the contracted service provider changes, any future service provider will also be able to provide these services for these makes and models. If repairs can be made using the DPW invoicing system and not by individual contract actions or credit card purchases, then system repairs can be done expeditiously and the duration of system outages can be reduced significantly.</p>
<p>B. The integration services from Trane, Inc., Piscataway, NJ to integrate the project's BAS into Fort Drum's existing EMCS.</p>
<p>The Non-Commissioned Office Academy will have a Building Automation System (BAS) which will need to be integrated into the Fort Drum EMCS. The BAS is a system that is able to monitor and control equipment on a building level. An EMCS is a system that is able to monitor and control equipment in a given building from a remote location. This is an important tool that can be used to improve a building's energy efficiency and to assist the DPW in their operational and maintenance tasks. By providing a single point of access to the equipment in the building, the EMCS affords the DPW's already strained workforce the ability to trouble-shoot and, in many cases, solve mechanical problems that occur. An effective EMCS is a key component in today's property management atmosphere, in which energy efficiency improvements are constantly a priority and operational and maintenance staffing is barely adequate. This EMCS is a fiber-based user interface that integrates multiple BACnet/IP based systems together, collects, stores, and displays historical data, and provides enterprise-wide facilities management capabilities from a central storage and operational location located at the Building Operating Control Center in Building P-4000. The project's BAS will be openly competed and will be compatible to the existing EMCS since the project's BAS is specified as BACnet/IP open protocol. However, the integration of the BAS into the EMCS must be performed by the manufacturer of the EMCS to ensure accountability of the EMCS functioning properly and warranty of the system. Furthermore, the existing EMCS has gone through the DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) and is fully DIACAP accredited. Integration of the project's BAS into the EMCS through a third party may result in the DIACAP accreditation being lost.</p>
<p>Specifications for EMCS integration that do not include the EMCS vendor integrating the BAS into the EMCS would result in a failure to achieve an important objective of this project, which is to integrate the mechanical controls of the Non-Commissioned Office Academy into the Fort Drum Trane EMCS. There are no alternatives to this approach that would not directly result in the failure to execute this portion of the project's scope of work.</p>
<p><br />4. Any vendor that wishes to provide an alternate source to the brand names above that is compatible with the above must provide a response with data supporting the claim within 5 business days of this announcement to New York District, Corps of Engineers, Contracting Division, and Attn: Loretta Parris at Loretta.e.parris@usace.army.mil. Telephone Number 917-790-8182.</p>
<p>5. This is a market survey and notification of intent only. This is not a request to respond to a solicitation. This project will be solicited at a future date.</p>

<DESC>The government is interested in moderate to high TRL/MRL technologies that can be used to fabricate, assemble, and demonstrate low cost vehicle components. It is understood that the incorporation of certain low cost materials and/or manufacturing processes could potentially have significant impact on the component design. Therefore, this RFI is also interested in understanding various low cost materials and manufacturing processes that could be used to fabricate aircraft components and their potential impact on vehicle design. Additionally, the government is interested in industry capabilities to quickly and inexpensively assemble components into prototype units, sub-system integration into the aircraft, and prototype ground testing. Because of the primary driving goal of minimizing average unit flyaway costs (AUFC), the government is also interested in gathering process specific cost information to justify investment decisions as future ground vehicle demonstrations are planned and executed.
<p>We are interested in current industry plans for future internal investments in any of the specific technical areas below. This knowledge will allow Air Force personnel to leverage industry and other agency investments. We welcome disclosure and a review of industry investment plans that include demonstrations of technologies that already have or will shortly achieve maturity levels of TRL/MRL-5.</p>

DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">is offering the opportunity to<span style="COLOR: red"> </span>further develop and commercialize its technology to additively manufacture fiber reinforced composites</span>.
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Background</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">High performance carbon fiber/thermoset polymer (CF/thermoset) composites are a potentially transformative materials solution for a range of applications as they can have mechanical properties of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>steel at a fraction of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the density. However, the development and application of these materials is limited by the process by which they are manufactured.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">High performance CF/thermoset composites (typically based on aromatic epoxy resins) are produced via a labor intensive winding and hand layup process which is both costly and severely limits the control over the final component micro-meso structure and further the performance, reliability and repeatability of the parts and process. Chopped or short mixed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>carbon fiber/epoxy composites are a cheap alternative to continuous CF/Epoxy systems. However, the manufacturing processes utilized to form short fiber composites (injection, spray molding and pressing) provides little control of the internal fiber phase alignment - limiting the mechanical performance and reliability of final parts.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The poor processability of current short fiber/epoxy composite systems precludes their use in all but the most basic of molding and casting processes - limiting the shape, complexity and architectural control over the final part. In addition - chopped or discrete CF/epoxy &amp; potential continuous fiber DIW fiber composite deposition using direct ink wiring or other novel means is limited by current epoxy resin systems which preclude the use of DIW or any other method of constructing a self-supporting shape of any complexity that can mechanically constrain the fibers on a reasonable manufacturing timeframe (minutes/seconds).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">No commercial means of additively manufacturing continuous or short fiber-reinforced thermoset through direct ink writing (DIW) or any other AM process currently exists. This is in part a result of the limitations of current resin and processing technologies which do not allow rapid cure or accurate spatial orientation of the fiber phase within the resin matrix in a part.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in; TEXT-INDENT: -1in"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Description</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL researchers have developed the hardware and chemistry to allow additive manufacturing of short carbon fibers in a thermoset polymer matrix which have a high degree of structural alignment over conventional cast or pressed short/chopped carbon fiber polymer composites.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in">The invention is based on the shear dispersal, alignment and concentration of fiber fraction within a resin system to yield a direct Ink Writable (DIW) system that can be utilized to 3D print complex architectures of highly aligned CF/epoxy resin composite with feature resolutions as low as 250um.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The short carbon fibers can be produced in a range of polymer matrices including bisphenol F epoxy resins and cyanate esters. The apparatus, systems, and methods provide additive manufacturing of a fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) product using a direct ink writing system</span></p>

Secondary novelty lies in the combination of this printing system with a novel latent curing resin system and LLNL DIW technology to yield a complete system capable of 3D printing complex geometries at high resolutions and high fiber volume fractions with high degrees of controlling internal fiber alignment.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Additive manufacturing and 3D printing technologies offer the potential to both fully automate the production of CF composites and allow new degrees of freedom and control over the fiber placement orientation and microstructure<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>- leading to vast improvements<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>in performance, reliability, scalability and cost reductions.</span></p>

<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Oct 2014), applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a capabilities statement to include evidence of being a telecommunications company which has the ability to deliver Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID) and number portability at the Government demarcation point at the site specified in the Appendix 10 attachment, page 1.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 -Local Communication Services. <br />2a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror submits a sound approach for supporting local communication services in a detailed SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend. The diagram and legend should clearly illustrate the Offeror's capability to meet all SOW and site-specific Appendix 10 requirements. Reference the Appendix 10, para. 10.13 attachment A, "Traditional Legacy" and attachment B, "Utilizing SIP Trunking", or Offerors may use a combination of both attachments to submit the Offeror's diagram. Provide the requested diagram and legend using these formats or a similar format.</p>
<p>2b. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a written description of each service that will be delivered in the site-specific diagram and the methodology of their delivery.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Evidence of Agreements.<br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror states whether your company is providing a proposal as a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC). If providing a proposal as a CLEC for ANY and/or ALL services, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;<br />(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;<br />(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and<br />(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;<br />(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and<br />(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;<br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

This acquisition will be processed under FAR part 12- Acquisition for Commercial Items and in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(2) and 41 U.S.C. 1901 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541690 "Other Scientific and Consulting Services," and the business size standard is $15 million.<br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract. <br /><br />The period of performance will be twelve (12) months from date of award, followed by two option periods of twelve (12) months each. <br /><br />The NCI, CCG is a part of the National Institutes of Health. The NCI CCG's goal is to integrate structural, functional, and computational tools with multiple cancer genomic datasets, which are then made broadly available via data commons to the research community. To this end, in June 2016, CCG launched the Genomics Data Commons (GDC), an integrated database to house multiple large-scale cancer genomics data sets with supporting analytical tools. The GDC is a growing, multi-petabyte collection of data generated by CCG Offices and other cancer genomic programs housed on a "big data" cloud-capable technology stack designed and built under contract to CCG. GDC currently includes data from <br /><br />The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) programs. Data from an additional 10 NCI-sponsored programs are slated to enter GDC over the next 1.5 years. A key requirement of data entering the GDC is that they must be harmonized into a single standard for maintenance and eventual comparability during analyses. As more data is added to the GDC, the system's value to the research community multiplies.<br /><br />The objectives of this procurement are to ensure the continued success of the GDC, a complex database and analytical software system that manages petabytes (and growing) of cancer genomic data, and related programs that contribute data to the GDC. Much of the success of the GDC to date is dependent on understanding the nature of the data going into it, the lessons learned from prior systems holding cancer genome data, and understanding modern architectures of system capable of managing such data. The GDC's operation requires that data, despite being obtained from disparate sources working with diverse technical standards and policies, must be harmonized upon deposition so that GDC systems supporting data management, analytical tools, and data access policies can be operated on by single software framework. The data must be harmonized so that investigators can access data of interest across multiple projects using a uniform set of credentials, semantics and analytical tools. <br /><br />The Contractor shall perform the following, unless otherwise noted: <br />Support for CCG's critical programs is provided in four task areas, briefly described below:<br />&bull; Task Area 1 - Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG): Provide expert guidance and support for with CCG's oversight of the of the GDC to facilitate the continued development and utilization CCG's Genomics Data Commons (GDC).<br />&bull; Task Area 2 - Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG): Provide support and expert technical guidance that facilitates policy and standards compliance and data normalization.<br />&bull; Task Area 3 - CCG Programs Office/TCGA: <br />&bull; Clinical Data Center (CDC) and Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR) Support: provide expert technical support for clinical data and biospecimen service procurement efforts.<br />&bull; Cancer Characterization Programs: provide expert technical guidance and services to support the closure of completed programs and ongoing activities of new programs.<br />&bull; Task Area 4 - Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG):<br />&bull; DCEG Biorepository Inventory Management System Review: provide continued Subject Matter Expert support to DCEG Director's Office for the implementation of the restructured biorepository system.<br />&bull; Next Gen Cohort: support the Deputy Director DCEG and the study's Principal Investigator in procurement of data systems required for the Next Gen Cohort study.<br />&bull; DCEG-wide Operations Management and Reporting Platform: support the Deputy Director DCEG in developing a system to provide operational reporting data (a "dashboard") to DCEG leadership that tracks the status of studies in DCEG from concept and inception through all stages ending in manuscript clearance.<br />&bull; Genomics Data Commons (GDC): support the Director and Deputy Director DCEG in developing a plan to pilot deposition of DCEG data sets into the GDC.
<p>Dr. Martin Ferguson is currently providing services to CCG under a subcontract with the Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).

ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS<br />The contractor cannot assign any right or delegate any obligations under this contract without the prior written<br />permission of the Contracting Officer.<br />11. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE<br />The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best<br />interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in<br />accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for<br />services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of<br />this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims<br />covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in<br />accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.<br />12. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT<br />Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract without<br />further recourse to the other and mutual release of any further obligations.<br />13. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE<br />a. The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs c. and d. below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate<br />this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-<br />(1) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any extension;<br />(2) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (however, see paragraph b. below); or<br />(3) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (however see paragraph b. below).<br />b. The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under paragraph a. 2. and a. 3. above, may be exercised if the<br />Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer)<br />after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br />c. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the<br />Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will<br />remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue<br />the work not terminated.<br />d. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without<br />the fault or negligence of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to<br />perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />Examples of such causes include:<br />(1) Acts of God or of the public enemy<br />Modified 1 January 2015<br />(2) Act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity<br />(3) Fires<br />(4) Floods<br />(5) Epidemics<br />(6) Quarantine restrictions<br />(7) Strikes<br />(8) Freight embargoes<br />(9) Unusually severe weather<br />e. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the<br />NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information,<br />and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has<br />specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting<br />Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />f. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and<br />Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for<br />the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The<br />NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the<br />NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />g. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations<br />of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />h.

If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in<br />accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for<br />services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of<br />this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims<br />covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in<br />accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.<br />12. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT<br />Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract without<br />further recourse to the other and mutual release of any further obligations.<br />13. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE<br />a. The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs c. and d. below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate<br />this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-<br />(1) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any extension;<br />(2) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (however, see paragraph b. below); or<br />(3) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (however see paragraph b. below).<br />b. The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under paragraph a. 2. and a. 3. above, may be exercised if the<br />Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer)<br />after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br />c. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the<br />Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will<br />remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue<br />the work not terminated.<br />d. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without<br />the fault or negligence of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to<br />perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />Examples of such causes include:<br />(1) Acts of God or of the public enemy<br />Modified 1 January 2015<br />(2) Act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity<br />(3) Fires<br />(4) Floods<br />(5) Epidemics<br />(6) Quarantine restrictions<br />(7) Strikes<br />(8) Freight embargoes<br />(9) Unusually severe weather<br />e.

Upon direction of the Contracting<br />Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />f. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and<br />Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for<br />the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The<br />NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the<br />NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />g. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations<br />of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />h. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided<br />by law or under this contract.<br />i. This contract is automatically terminated for the convenience of the government in the event the NAFI is<br />dissolved.<br />14. CHANGES<br />a. The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make<br />changes within the general scope of this Contract in any one or more of the following:<br />(1) If the requirement is for supplies and/or services: drawings, designs, or specifications; method of<br />shipment or packing; description of services to be performed; time of performance (i.e., hours of the day,<br />days of the week, etc.); place of delivery or place of performance of services.<br />(2) If the requirement is for concession services (including public private ventures): specifications<br />(including drawings and designs); method or manner of performance of work; NAFI-furnished facilities,<br />equipment, materials, services, or site; and/or directing acceleration in the performance of work.<br />(3) If the requirement is for transportation services: specifications; work or services; place of origin; place<br />of delivery; tonnage to be shipped; and/or amount of NAFI-furnished property.<br />b.

The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt<br />of the written order; however, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting<br />Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the Contract.<br />d. If the Contractor's proposal includes the cost of property made obsolete or excess by the change, the<br />Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.<br />e. If the requirement is for architect-engineer or other professional services, no services for which an additional<br />cost or fee will be charged by the Contractor shall be furnished without the prior written authorization of the<br />Contracting Officer.<br />f.

Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a "claim" under either the "Claims" or "Disputes Resolution"<br />clause of this Contract; however, nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the<br />Contract as changed.<br />15.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched The Pakistan Transition Initiative (PTI) program in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in November of 2007, and subsequently expanded the program into priority areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) in September of 2009, and Sindh and Punjab in October of 2011.</p>
<p>The PTI program supports the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) development efforts to better integrate FATA/KP into the political and economic mainstream of Pakistan. PTI also supports the GOP in identifying community priorities and addressing some of the region's most immediate needs, which requires close coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department, and Department of Defense activities in the region. In Sindh and Punjab, PTI works to counter violent extremism in order to build a foundation for political and social development in conflict-prone communities in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative post is a middle-management position requiring excellent managerial and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation at the highest levels (government and non-government organizations), and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition. The candidate must be mature, self-reliant, a team player, a problem solver, and able to manage a diverse portfolio of grants. The incumbent should have extensive management experience (both project and personnel) and understand the basics of grantees and contractor/USAID relationships. The Deputy Country Representative must communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, U.S. Government agencies, and clerics or other religious leaders. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.</p>
<p>Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights. Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically charged and challenging security environments.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, the Deputy Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by Embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick impact programming model. Support to Embassies and USAID Missions may also include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming, including but not limited to rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups, many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as Acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	As appropriate, communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the US Embassy, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation, 2) OTI contractor performance, 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale, 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other U.S. Government entities, 5) security concerns, 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives, and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Administrative Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other related duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will be supervised by the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee in the country of assignment. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will set overall objectives and resources available, and work with the employee to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The employee will be responsible for planning and carrying out assignments, resolving most conflicts, coordinating with others, and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives. Keeping the supervisor informed of progress, the employee may determine the approach to be taken and the methodology to be used. The supervisor will review completed work from an overall standpoint of feasibility, compatibility with other work, or effectiveness in meeting requirements.</p>
<p>10.	PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS:<br />While in Pakistan, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may involve some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>WORK ENVIRONMENT:<br />While in Pakistan, the work is primarily performed in an office setting. However, freedom of movement restrictions can vary greatly depending on the assigned location in-country. The position will likely require travel throughout the country of assignment, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>MSC TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />Offers/quotes submitted in response to this solicitation shall not contain nor be subject to the offeror's/vendor's standard commercial terms and conditions. Any offer/quote submitted in response to this solicitation which includes the offeror's/vendor's standard commercial terms and conditions may be considered a material defect and may be rejected as being non-responsive to the solicitation.</p>

<p>Hyper Spectral-Multi Spectral Technology Advancement</p>
<p>The US Government has invested in the development of real-time Hyper Spectral/Multi Spectral imaging technology and algorithms to support automated target acquisition of weapons, personnel, and vehicles. Real-time Hyper Spectral/Multi Spectral technology provides a robust capability for the area of target acquisition by utilizing the target's unique spectral signature to detect and track them on screen, providing users a visual cue for targets of interest which would normally be difficult to see with the naked eye.<br /><br />The current MSI Camera has been designed to interface with the current M153 Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS). This is a land/sea based system. With ruggedization and CROWS application as the focus, we would like to further the Technology Readiness Level to a 7 with operational environment in mind. Production and technology/design refinement areas are the main focus to produce an affordable and capable real-time MSI camera for CROWS integration.<br />&nbsp;<br />The U.S. Government is looking to industry with experience in areas of camera/optical development, packaging, and manufacturing for military applications to include camera systems as well as their subcomponents; sensors, lenses, filters, zoom mechanisms, etc.</p>
<p><br />Interested companies are invited to come to Picatinny Arsenal, NJ to learn more about this technology, ask questions, network, and provide insight to advance the current state of the technology in performance (detection, algorithms, range, zoom capability), cost minimization, ruggedization, and manufacturability.</p>

No procurement strategy will be determined based solely on the information received in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.

<p>3) Bonding Capacity: Provide your surety's name, your maximum bonding capacity per project, and your aggregate maximum bonding capacity. In lieu of bonding, a bank letter of guarantee in the amount of 30% of the individual task order amount can be provided.

<p>5) Experience: Submit a minimum of three (3) recent specific government or commercial contracts/projects your firm has performed as the prime contractor to demonstrate your experience in construction of commercial and institutional buildings as indicated in this announcement. A specific project is a single project or a single task order under an indefinite quantity contract or on-call type contract. Recent is defined as having been 100% completed within the five years prior to the submission due date. Two of the three project should be design/build with a minimum construction cost of $1,000,000 each.

<DESC>Award Notice for Medical Coding, Auditing and Training Services at Military Treatment Facilities Worldwide.

Award Date:  31 August 2016

PoP:  1 September 2016 through 30 November 2016
Option 1 PoP: 1 December 2016 through 28 February 2017

When the complete package for this requirement was received on 22 October 2015, the requirement was already two months behind schedule due to constant change requests from the customer.  The Solicitation Review Board for the competitive procurement was held on 8 January 2016.  Until all questions/concerns were addressed and all changes were incorporated, the solicitation was not released until 1 March 2016.  Less than a week after the solicitation posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov), the customer requested significant changes to the requirement, specifically to remove the Data Quality Audits portion of the requirement and procure these services as a separate requirement.  With these changes, the PWS had to be modified, as well as all of the quantities for most of the CLINs.

Additionally, over one hundred questions were received on the solicitation from interested vendors.  Until all the questions were addressed and any necessary changes were made, the solicitation closing date had to be extended several times with the official closing date being 9 May 2016.

The Technical Evaluation Team, Past Performance Evaluation Team and the Pricing/Business Evaluation Team commenced their evaluations on 13 May 2016.  The due date for each evaluation was set at 23 June 2016.  The Past Performance and Pricing/Business evaluations were completed on or before the due date of 23 June 2016.  The Technical Evaluation Report was completed 15 August 2016.

Once legal sufficiency is received on the technical evaluation report, the entire evaluation team (technical, past performance and price/business) will meet to determine rankings of the proposals. The competitive range will be determined at this time and the PCO can prepare to enter into discussions with the offerors.

Due to the reasons cited above, approval to sole source this requirement to the three current contract holders was approved by NAVSUP on 26 August 2016 to avoid a lapse in services.  In order to ensure all sites retain these services without a lapse, approval is requested to sole source bridge contracts to the three current contract holders while the documents for the new competitive contract are completed.  The new competitive contract is in the technical evaluation phase of the procurement.  There is no anticipation of being able to award without discussions.  In order to conduct meaningful discussions, allow sufficient time for the offerors to provide revised proposals, allow sufficient time to evaluate the revised proposals, and complete the award process, it was unrealistic to expect this to be completed by the time the previous contract ended on 31 August 2016.  A lapse in these services would have been an unacceptable solution because the Navy’s hospitals and clinics worldwide would become noncompliant with federal regulations.  Medical coding allows administrations to look at the prevalence and effectiveness of treatment in their facility, which is especially important to hospitals because they can track the efficiency of their treatments.  Additionally, Medical coding is essential because it is how claims for payment are reported for appropriate reimbursement of provided medical services.  Without medical coding services, there would be an unacceptable delay in payment to the providers which would affect the operations of the MTFs and their ability to meet their mission of patient safety and patient care.

<AWARDEE>SVD STARS II, LLC
<DESC>This is an 8(a) direct award under 8(a) STARS II. The Period of Performance is for 12 months. <br /><br />SECTION C - PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management. The role of the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is to link U.S. agriculture to the world to enhance export opportunities and global food security. <br />The FAS Office of Chief Operating Officer (OCOO) is responsible for worldwide management operations, including budget and financial management, information technology applications support, human capital management, program and management compliance, international travel services, personnel security, emergency management, contracting, and training support. The OCOO Information Services Division (ISD) is the lead organization for this effort.<br />FAS is assessing and adjusting capital planning and investment control and acquisition planning policies and practices to more explicitly incorporate agile modular approaches in IT development and acquisition. Using these approaches, FAS expects to realize faster returns on IT investments and deploy technology solutions that will propel it towards a &#862;21st century digital government, one that is efficient, effective and focused on improving the delivery of services to the American people.<br />C.1 BACKGROUND<br />As outlined in the 25 Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology Management, Federal agencies have traditionally taken a multi-year "grand design" approach for developing, modernizing, and enhancing investments in IT. This approach is grounded in the common notion that responsible development necessitates a full detailing of requirements before work can start. Although a seemingly reasonable assumption, practical evidence and private sector experience has shown that large and complex IT implementations often encounter cost and schedule overruns, as the painstaking process of requirements gathering too frequently takes years to complete. Subsequently, agencies lose visibility into the performance of these multi-year IT development investments which affects their ability to implement corrective actions that reduce risk or mitigate financial exposure. The Government increases investment risk in these situations because: (1) the IT solutions that had once addressed agency requirements may no longer be pertinent or a priority; (2) substantial funds are allocated towards outdated solutions without any returns on the investments; or (3) agencies encounter budgetary constraints before substantive work is completed. <br />To help resolve these issues, modular approaches should be used in the development of IT investments, allowing agencies to implement significant capabilities for investments through the use of modular solutions that can be defined, developed, and deployed within months instead of several years. <br />The Information Services Division (ISD) has adopted agile software development practices as its modular approach to divide investments into smaller parts in order to reduce investment risk, deliver capabilities more rapidly, and permit easier adoption of newer and emerging technologies. <br />C.2 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS</p>
<p>Contracting Guidance to Support Modular Development June 2012</p>
<p>C.3 ISD Services</p>
<p>Efforts in support of ISD may be deleted and added during the life of the Task Order.</p>
<p>C.4 SCOPE</p>
<p>As specified by the Government, the Contractor shall perform the efforts required under this Task Order as part of Integrated Project Teams (IPT) comprised of a mix of Government and Contractor personnel, including Contractors working under other task orders and/or contracts to deliver business results using agile software development techniques.</p>
<p>The scope of this PWS encompasses six work streams. Each work stream consists of multiple subtasks. The work streams shall be performed on a labor hour basis. <br />Expert support is required to re-engineer the way the Agency uses technology to support agency-wide business process improvement initiatives and carry out its day-to-day work. Projects will vary in size and scope, depending upon the requirements of FAS.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be directly responsible for ensuring the accuracy, timeliness, and completion of all subtasks defined under this Task Order by the COR. The Contractor shall provide a wide range of Contractor support to help FAS and its sub-organizations assess programmatic success, consolidate functions, and streamline management and IT processes to achieve transparency and better management controls. The Contractor shall ensure that software development work and deliverables will utilize secure coding techniques and meet all requirements for secure coding practices and assessment and authorization (A&amp;A) as required by NIST, OMB, USDA, and FAS. Software development work will be predominately Sharepoint and/or Drupal related efforts.</p>
<p>The scope includes development and modernization of IT applications and systems to achieve outcomes via improvement to or complete redesign of people/process/technology solutions; working with government staff to identify programmatic improvement opportunities that can be effected through more strategic deployment of information technology; and proposing plans for business process improvement and business process reengineering efforts that dovetail with the overhaul of the way the Agency uses information technology resources.</p>
<p>Organizational Change management is critical to this overhaul effort and the transition to a modernized organization will require communications (vertical and horizontal), outreach, training, messaging, as well as assisting leadership and technical staff with the transition from the current model to the new paradigm resulting from modular approaches to application development and IT investment strategies.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command has awarded a contract for the planning, long-lend material, and prefabrication required for work during the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from late 2016 to early 2017. This effort will include planning, material procurement, prefabrication, manpower, support services, design integration, engineering and management support, and technical data required to prepare for and accomplish this work during the availability. The work to be accomplished will include repair or replacement of shipboard nuclear support and propulsion systems, work within nuclear controlled spaces, and work on specialized systems (e.g. catapults, arresting<br />gear, aircraft elevators, etc.) that only the original ship builder has displayed the unique certifications, capabilities, and expertise required. Due to the nature of work, the Government does not anticipate significant subcontracting opportunities. Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Huntington Ingalls Incorporated - Newport News Shipbuilding directly.

<p><br />1<br />Attachment 1: 6/15/2016<br />DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (DHS)<br />U.S. COAST GUARD<br />RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (RDC)<br />STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)<br />FOR<br />WAVE GENERATOR SYSTEM FOR JOINT MARINE TEST FACILITY (JMTF)<br />1.1 Background<br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Research &amp; Development Center (RDC) conducts a variety of research projects in the area of oil spill response. One of the specific topics is the use of in-situ burning. This is a technique that involves corralling the oil within a fire-resistant boom or enclosed area and igniting it. Although it creates a dark plume, it also removes the oil from the surface of the water. One of the research facilities owned by the RDC is a 40 foot by 100 foot (outer dimensions) steel open outdoor tank which is located at the Joint Maritime Test Facility (JMTF) on Little Sand Island in Mobile, AL. The average depth of the pan is four feet with a recommended difference between water level and edge of pan of one foot. This facility was originally built in 1998 and a multiple of tests were conducted through 2002. At that time, the equipment was drained and the system placed inactive. In the ensuing years, several hurricanes hit the Mobile, AL area which moved the tank and destroyed all of the electrical connections and piping used for both water and oil. In 2014, the RDC began a refurbishment of the tank that included re-leveling and repair of the tank. This statement of work is another step in the process of tank refurbishment by providing a wave-making capability that conforms to American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standards.<br />1.2 Scope<br />The scope of this order is to design, build and install the equipment needed to create waves in the tank that the government can use to meet the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard F2152.<br />1.3 Compliance Documents<br />The following documents provide specifications, standards, or guidelines that must be complied with in order to meet the requirements of this task order:<br />1. ASTM F1155 Standard Practice for Selection and Application of Piping System Materials1<br />2. SAE J1942 Qualified Hoses for Marine Applications<br />3. ASTM F2152 Standard Guide for In-Situ Burning of Spilled Oil: Fire-Resistant Boom1<br />4. ASTM F1510 Standard Specification for Rotary Positive Displacement Pumps, Commercial Ships Use<br />2 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS/TASKS<br />2<br />Attachment 1: 6/15/2016<br />2.1 Kick-off Meeting<br />The contractor shall participate in a kick-off meeting at the RDC's Joint Maritime Test Facility (JMTF) on Little Sand Island (LSI) in Mobile Bay, AL within 14 days of award. The contractor will have the opportunity to visit the burn pan and take measurements and take photographs as needed.<br />2.2 Project Plan<br />The contractor shall provide a draft Project Plan (Deliverable 1) at the Kickoff Meeting for Government review and comment. The contractor shall provide a final Project Plan to the COR based upon feedback from the Kickoff Meeting.<br />2.3 TASK 1 Wave Generator System Design<br />The contractor shall design a Wave Generator System to create the various wave heights and periods called out in ASTM F2152, Section 6.4.4. [Compliance Document 3] in the 90 Ft Long x 30 Ft Wide x 5 Ft High pan (inner test section dimensions) located at the USCG Joint Maritime Test Facility on Little Sand Island, Mobile, AL. The wave created by the Wave Generator System shall be of a non-breaking sinusoidal shape.<br />The contractor shall use the GFI Documents (Sections 1.3 and 4) to inform the design. The contractor's wave generator design, build and installation shall include:<br />&bull; A method of control located adjacent to the tank/hydraulic system that provides continuous range of wave characteristics that cover the values in the ASTM standard F2152, Section 6.4.4. This may be direct control (with a type of direct read-out) or indirect using instructions to set pressures range of motion or other parameters within the system.<br />&bull; All equipment mounting platforms and/or structures.<br />&bull; Equipment that can withstand high temperatures during petroleum burns.<br />&bull; Equipment within the tank that runs on a continuous unmonitored basis for no less than one hour.<br />&bull; Environmental protection to include sun exposure for the equipment during inactive times.<br />&bull; All equipment designed to withstand temperatures up to 200F that included ambient temperature during a hot day in Mobile plus some radiated heat from a fire test.<br />&bull; Ancillary hydraulic equipment located adjacent to the pan but no more than 25 feet away either on the sides or ends of the tank (See GFI 4.1 for pictures)<br />&bull; Any special requirements for power (Current power available is 120V AC but if different power is needed, the contractor shall specify in their design)<br />&bull; Any special adaptations to the tank.<br />&bull; A readily removable false beach at the far end of the pan to dissipate any interfering wave actions. The design to include the size, slope and material for the beach; and interfaces allowing for the removal of the beach by JMTF available resources.<br />&bull; Certified hoses and quick-disconnect fittings so that the elements of the wave generator that are not welded to the burn pan itself can be dismantled into no<br />3<br />Attachment 1: 6/15/2016<br />larger than pallet-sized sections (48 inch by 40 inch by 48 inch high) for removal during emergency.<br />The contractor has two options for developing this capacity:<br />1) Use part or the whole of the existing wave generator that consists of a paddle and a hydraulic cylinder [See pictures/configuration in GFI 4.1 - 4.3]. The contractor shall provide a fully functional system that includes all of the hydraulic cylinder(s), fittings, hoses, pumps, cooling systems, controllers, etc that are needed to completely run the system.<br />2) Design, build, and install a completely new wave generator system.<br />If the contractor's design references standards and specifications other than those in Section 1.3, the contractor shall explicitly list the standard and provide a brief justification of their use.<br />The contractors shall create a test plan to exercise the wave generator to confirm the operation of the individual components and the overall performance. This plan shall describe a method to measure the wave period and height.<br />The contractor shall create operating instructions and maintenance instructions, which include hydraulic oil specifications, filter and oil change intervals and instructions, and troubleshooting advice.<br />The contractor shall submit a Wave Generator Design Package (Deliverable 2) that includes all of the design parameters, calculations, installation drawings, parts list, operating instructions, maintenance instructions and the test plan as an Appendix.<br />2.4 Build, Install and Test Wave Generator System<br />The contractor shall build and install the components of the system according to the Government approved design within 115 days of award.<br />The contractor shall test the system within 136 days of award.

<DESC>The 145th Mission Support Group Contracting office in Charlotte, NC intends to issue a written request for quotation and resulting sole source contract to BERGMANN ASSOCIATES INC for a code and criteria review of an already accomplished 100% B-3 Design effort. BERGMANN ASSOCIATES INC is the firm who accomplished the original design in 2010. Bringing the original design up to date with current code can only be accomplished through BERGMANN ASSOCIATES INC as they own the copyright to the design effort. Re-accomplishing the design completely is not cost-efficient compared to performing the update. Anticipated award date is 30 September 2016. This action is being taken in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source." A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in preparation of any capabilities statements or documents prepared for this notice. NOTE: If documents are sent via e-mail, the contractor will be responsible for validating Government receipt by contacting the Contracting Officer Zachary Leddy at zachary.d.leddy.mil@mail.mil. No solicitation is available at this time and telephone requests for information will not be taken.

				Office of Acquisition Operations
				Strategic Acquisition Center
				10300 Spotsylvania Avenue, Suite 400
				Fredericksburg, VA  22408

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for digital scales, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6, "Limited Sources". The required items are supplied by A & D Engineering, Inc., an other than small business, located at 1756 Automation Parkway, San Jose, CA 95131-1873. These items will be procured via VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) V797D-40211 to populate the MSPV formulary with mandatory health care supplies.  The MSPV formulary is a list of approved healthcare commodities including medical, surgical, dental, laboratory, facilities/cleaning products, and textiles.  This LSJ will supply the MSPV formulary with digital scales and blood pressure monitors distributed by A & D Engineering, Inc. on a not-to-exceed 12-month period of performance until these items can be competed in accordance with FAR 8.405-3.  As the identified required items are competed, the item will no longer be acquired under the LSJ; thus, bringing the MSPV formulary in compliance with the competition requirements of FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements".

3.  Acquisition History:  VHA manages the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.  In 2013, the system consisted of 21 Veterans Integrated Services Networks with approximately 150 medical centers, 820 outpatient clinics, and various other facilities to include Community Living Centers, Veteran Centers and Domiciliaries.  Together, these health care facilities, and the more than 53,000 independent licensed health care practitioners who work within them, provide comprehensive care to about 9.3 million enrolled Veterans.  The MSPV Program is the primary means to obtain medical and surgical supply support for the VA healthcare system through contract support.  VHA, in cooperation with VA's National Acquisition Center (NAC), initiated contract support for the MSPV program in 2005.  The result was the first generation of seven prime vendor distributor contracts that not only support VHA, but also support the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of State, Indian Health Service, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Since that time, VHA and NAC have successfully executed two long-term, multiple-award 5-year contracts in support of the MSPV program.  In 2015, upon expiration of the second MSPV program, a set of bridge contracts were executed by the NAC extending the period of performance to April 19, 2016.  Those bridge contracts were as follows:  VA797N-15-C-0003, VA797N-15-C-0004, VA797N-15-C-0005, VA797N-15-C-0006, VA797N-15-C-0007, VA797N-15-C-0008, and VA797N-15-C-0009.  

In preparation for the continuation of the MSPV Program, the Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) assumed responsibility to award the new MSPV contracts in 2014.  Due to a protest and continued technical evaluations, the SAC Contracting Officer determined that a second set of bridge contracts would be required to ensure continuity of services and the continuance of healthcare support throughout the VA community beyond the bridge contracts' expiration on April 19, 2016.  In February 2016, the SAC awarded the second set of bridge contracts.  They are as follows:  VA119-16-D-0007, VA119-16-D-0008, VA119-16-D-0009, VA119-16-D-0010, VA119-16-D-0011, VA119-16-D-0012, and VA119-16-D-0013.  The period of performance for the second SAC bridge contracts began April 20, 2016, and will expire no later than April 19, 2017.

Leveraging the NAC's lessons learned, VHA and SAC developed a procurement strategy for a complete VA-wide MSPV formulary of approved supplies by April 2016.  To execute this plan, VHA and SAC formed a team in February 2015, to initiate development of the MSPV formulary.  The goal of this team was to solicit and award approximately 7,000 individual line-items, identified as an optimal initial level, for the pending MSPV formulary.  The team developed a streamlined approach to solicit and award these items, which involved VHA providing salient characteristics for all 7,000 line-items, and SAC awarding competitive BPAs based on those salient characteristics.  

Between April 2015 and January 2016, VHA forwarded to SAC approximately 4,400 individual procurement packages consisting of both single and multiple line-items, of which approximately 3,500 were solicited and 900 returned to VHA for inclusion in future grouping efforts.  Although SAC issued multiple Requests for Quotations (RFQs), vendor response rates averaged less than 30 percent.  Due to lack of response, SAC and VHA sought input from industry via a series of MSPV Industry Days.  When queried, industry partners indicated two main problems: (1) VHA's salient characteristics were flawed and/or insufficient.  They did not appear to be based on clinical input, and often cited unnecessary manufacturer-specific features.  This prohibited timely and quality responses, or no responses at all in many cases; (2) Industry also indicated the administrative burden of providing quotes for single-item BPA awards was not cost effective enough for them to provide quotes. 

In order to obtain a better success rate, and work on completing new MSPV contracts, two possible strategies were identified:  (1) VHA created supply-line commodity teams, and began seeking clinical input for the development of salient characteristics.  Additionally, logical commodity groupings were developed; and (2) moving forward, VHA's Program Management Office was to group line-items by supply-line categories, or by United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes.  Supply-line categories were found to be the most favored by industry.  In an effort to validate this, a Request for Information (RFI) was issued to industry in February 2016.  The RFI results confirmed the supply-line category approach as the most appropriate method to solicit BPAs for item inclusion in the approved formulary.  

On February 24, 2016, awards were made to four MSPV distributors, with an estimated performance starting 120 days after notice to proceed.  The period of performance under these contracts are scheduled to begin on August 20, 2016.  It was anticipated the distributors would have a full-line of 7,000 competitively awarded BPA formulary line-items to populate their electronic catalogs (e-catalog).  Due to lack of vendor response, the formulary fell short of the necessary items required to complete the Prime Vendor's e-catalog.  In an attempt to resolve the shortfall identified above, numerous changes in VA's strategy for populating the formulary were considered.  This directly resulted in the need to establish additional MSPV bridge distribution contracts to ensure continuation of service.  The MSPV bridge contracts were awarded with a start date of April 20, 2016.  This included a 3-month base period of performance, and three 3-month option periods.  The final period of performance expiration date is not-to-exceed 12 months.  

4.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The MSPV formulary will consist of two tiers:  1) the 1,600 line items previously competed by the SAC and NAC, which is being automatically populated into the MSPV formulary and estimated to be ready for use by October 20, 2016; and 2) the additional VA FSS items identified to be procured under this LSJ.  The full list of items covered under this LSJ is as follows:
Part Number	Item Description	Package Description	Estimated Quantity
UC-351	SCALE,BODY,WEIGHT,DIGITAL,CAPACITY 400 POUNDS,THIN PLATFORM	EA	6000
UC-321PL-K	MT PRECISION 450LBS DIGITAL SCALE TAA	EA	1000
TM-2430-DP3	AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR WITH ANALYSIS SOFTWARE	EA	10
XL-15	DIGITAL PEDOMETER	EA	2500
UA-651S-V	AUTOMATIC BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR WITH SMALL CUFF	EA	5200
UA-651M-V	AUTOMATIC BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR WITH MEDIUM CUFF	EA	200000
UA-651L-V	AUTOMATIC BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR WITH LARGE CUFF	EA	34000
UA-651W-V	AUTOMATIC BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR WITH WIDE RANGE CUFF	EA	72000
The reprieve offered by this LSJ will allow VHA to continue placing orders under the MSPV contracts on a temporary basis and avoid an interruption in the healthcare supply chain while SAC pursues competitive procurements for the MSPV formulary items.  

The proposed digital scales and blood pressure monitors will be ordered under the authority of this LSJ.  These items have been identified as high-use medical items vital to the successful implementation of the MSPV program.  VHA analyzed the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Medical Products Data Bank, focusing on the top high-volume purchases and identified two (2) types of critically needed digital scales distributed by A & D Engineering.  However, A & D Engineering provided quotes for an additional six (6) line items on their VA FSS. The Contractor identified these additional items as "high use" frequently ordered items, frequently ordered in conjunction with the initially proposed items.  The Contractor was cautioned that the VHA Program Office and the Contracting Officer will determine the viability of these items for inclusion in the MSPV catalog.  If accepted, the items will be considered in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation for inclusion in the proposed BPA.  

Until the MSPV formulary is competed, VHA's ordering officers will be allowed to place orders for the required medical instruments and accessories.  The anticipated total value of the proposed BPA over the life of the agreement is $XXXXXXXX.  The period of performance is not to exceed 12 months.  

5.  Statutory Authority and Supporting Rationale:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), Urgent and Compelling. 

6.  Rationale Supporting the Authority Cited Above:  Urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect the interest of the Government will not permit competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)". Significant adverse consequences will occur if the LSJ is not approved as the VA health care supply chain will be negatively impacted. Continuance of the MSPV Distribution Program is vital; any delay of distribution will directly impair the delivery of healthcare and services to approximately 9.5 million Veterans currently receiving care through the VA Healthcare System. A break in the health care supply chain will hinder or halt the delivery of essential medical, surgical, dental, and laboratory supplies and other contracted medical/surgical, cleaning, rescue and safety supplies and services used in the direct delivery of patient care.  

The VA Healthcare System receives approximately 40% of its medical and surgical supply support through the national MSPV Program.  Many of these items are standardized throughout the VA Healthcare System, and are a part of the formulary being developed for use in the VA. The formulary drives efficiency and familiarity in clinical practice which leads to improved patient outcomes and safety. It also decreases variation, thus reducing time to train and results in less misunderstanding when providing care. Standardization provides healthcare system benefits that are maximized because standardized items are interoperable. Facilities can then reinvest the savings earned into equipment and personnel that further enhance patient care.

Estimated cost reduction for purchase of individual items through the MSPV formulary is approximately $4M over the course of the twelve months proposed under this LSJ. The $4M estimate does not account for efficiencies in the ordering and inventory management processes. Overall annual inventory reduction specifically attributable to MSPV is estimated at approximately $40M.  

Disapproval of the LSJ will result in a disruption in the health care supply chain and negate these potential savings as facilities source supplies through other means.  Workload, man-hours, and cost of operations will increase as already depleting resources are lost and the agency will revert to the inefficient means of sourcing medical supplies as before the introduction of the national MSPV program in 2005.  Those methods include use of purchase cards and local VHA contracting.  

Use of purchase cards as an ordering method has shown to be more than 5 times the workload burden of using the delivery order method under the MSPV program.  In addition, there are approximately 2000 contracting staff in VHA, processing 576,134 actions annually.  If the MSPV Ordering Officers were unable to place orders, and those transactions were added to the workload of an already overburdened contracting staff, the result would be catastrophic.  

Lead times through contracting for other than emergency orders are 45 days.  All orders would become emergencies.  Past examples of canceled surgeries due to lengthy supply lead times would become the norm, adversely affecting timely access to care.  Items critical to immediate care will be jeopardized, and will impact the life safety of Veterans.  

VA has a critical role in the comprehensive emergency response to support local, regional, or national emergencies or disasters.  VA is charged with the delivery and coordination of support missions for VA facilities affected by disasters, and also performs missions assigned to VA by FEMA or US Dept. of Health & Human Services for response to and recovery from nationally-declared emergencies and disasters.  The Prime Vendor Program is critical to ensure VA provides a full range of support to healthcare facilities to ensure resiliency, continuity and rapid recovery of healthcare services during disasters and other potential disruptions to healthcare service delivery.  VAMCs and other select Federal facilities are designated Federal Emergency Medical Facilities with significant contingency and emergency response roles.  Accordingly, the MSPVs provide emergency supply support during major catastrophic events.  Any interruption in the health care supply chain significantly jeopardizes the ability of VA to ensure minimum disruption to delivery of critical services in a contingency situation.

Other alternatives were considered, including utilization of both the legacy bridge contracts and the MSPV contract concurrently while all of the supplies are competitively awarded.  The confusion this would create in the field is insurmountable.  A well coordinate supply chain is necessary to ensure facilities are supported, and Veterans are cared for timely.  There are no reasonable alternatives that would adequately address the circumstances presented. Any financial costs incurred by the Government to execute the BPAs under the authority of the LSJ and any potential costs or cost avoidance not realized through competition would not outweigh the benefits received through continuance of the health care supply chain. Approval of the LSJ is in the best interests of the Government and is justified by the urgency of the circumstances. 

The cost to the Government if the LSJ is not approved would not be primarily financial, although it is significant. The non-monetary costs of the health, welfare and safety of millions of Veterans cannot be quantified.  Every effort was made to compare these costs, benefits and other options; the VA cannot rationally find any other reasonable alternative.

VA considered the cost to the integrity of the procurement system and VA acknowledges the importance of protecting the integrity of the procurement system. However, VA feels this is an extraordinary situation and maintains that due to an already constricted schedule and the significant impact of these BPAs on the delivery of medical and surgical supplies and services to millions of Veterans, the facts of this case justify the unusual measure proposed under this LSJ.  VA considered the balance of the integrity of the procurement system and the interest of the Government and determined that the issuance of the BPAs under the authority of this LSJ is mitigated and justified.  A break in the health care supply chain will be costly and detrimentally disruptive to VA operations and delivery of critical healthcare services to 9.5 million Veterans.  

This action is vital to support VA's nationwide healthcare system and prevent disruptions to Veteran care.  The identified medical items represent supplies collectively determined essential by VHA medical centers to meet VA patient care needs.  Continued use of these products and source of supply will ensure timely delivery and minimize VA supply chain interruptions.  The vendor for these items was selected through use of data analytics tools and the Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB).  

The MSPV program is the primary means to obtain medical supplies; these items are regarded as critical to patient care.  These items are currently available under the legacy MSPV contracts.  Failure to make them available under MSPV would have catastrophic effects on the field's ability to support medical centers.  Each item would have to be purchased individually either via purchase card, or through local VHA Contracting Offices, with lead times of up to 45 days.  VHA Logistics and Contracting do not have the capacity to meet the constant throughput of high cost/high volume daily individual orders required to meet clinical care needs.  Bottlenecks resulting from capacity issues would result in insufficient inventory to meet critical needs for Veteran patients, and will have a significant patient safety impact.  It is imperative that VA transition from the present way of doing business under the current MSPV program to the new and revised mandatory MSPV program.  In executing this change the following improvements will be realized:

a.	The MSPV distributors shall not ship any medical/surgical or any other supplies that are not on the Government-provided MSPV formulary of approved medical/surgical supplies.
b.	The MSPV distributors shall not charge any VA formulary approved suppliers to handle their product in conjunction with the contract.
c.	The Government mandates all distributors to be Electronic Data Interchange compliant and it is in the BPAs/contracts. 
d.	The MSPV distributors shall not require product suppliers to carry liability insurance in excess of $1,000,000, charge tracking fees, and/or require additional discounts from product suppliers.
 
7.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  MSPV distribution contracts were awarded on February 24, 2016, and performance is scheduled to begin in October 2016.  The MSPV distributors require VA's formulary in order to fulfill the medical requirements at VA hospitals and clinics.  As stated previously, the Government intends to compete all line items within the next 12 months.  Market research shows there is adequate competition in support of the new requirements.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2), these actions will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO).  

8.  Determination of Best Value:  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d), the prices for supplies offered on FSS have already been determined to be fair and reasonable by NAC Contracting Officers.  Given VHA's critical need for the previously identified formulary supplies, and the short turn-around time until the MSPV formulary is fully implemented, VA intends to select the lowest published FSS vendor and seek additional discounts.  To compete these items would result in unacceptable delays, and potential mission failure.  In the future, additional discounts will be sought through competition for these products as part of the transition to the MSPV formulary.  

9.  Market Research:  The market research conducted for the MSPV requirement showed there are multiple suppliers capable of providing medical products however; performance is required by October 2016, and VA does not have adequate resources for timely completion of the required items. VA has a need to have consistent, uninterrupted sources of supply that meets system-wide requirements without compromising direct patient care to VA medical centers and/or related facilities.  VA has a plan to compete these items and market research supports this acquisition strategy.  

10.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:  SAC is currently establishing competitive single-award BPAs that are beginning to populate the MSPV formulary.  Competition is on-going; however, at the onset of MSPV's period of performance, the formulary will not have sufficient breadth of medical products to meet the operational needs of VA.  It is anticipated the MSPV distributors will begin accepting and delivering orders in October 2016 for all items covered in this LSJ. 

11. Actions to Increase Competition:  As described above, VA will compete future requirements and continuously add necessary products to the MSPV formulary.  SAC will work with VHA's program office to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions.  VA has and will continue to meet with industry on a periodic basis for continued input and feedback on acquisition strategies.  All future acquisitions of MSPV BPAs will be solicited and awarded in a manner that promotes competition to greatest extent practicable.

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for power injector syringes, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6, "Limited Sources." The required items are supplied by 1st American Medical Distributor, located at 152 Heritage Park Drive, Suite 20, Murfreesboro, TN  37129-1204. These items will be procured via the VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) V797P-4109B to populate the MSPV-NG formulary with mandatory health care supplies.  The MSPV-NG formulary is a list of approved healthcare commodities including medical, surgical, dental, laboratory, facilities/cleaning products, and textiles.  This LSJ will supply the MSPV-NG formulary with medical instrument and accessories distributed by 1st American Medical Distributor on a not-to-exceed 12-month period of performance until these items can be competed in accordance with FAR 8.405-3.  As the identified required items are competed, they will no longer be acquired under the LSJ; thus, bringing the MSPV-NG formulary in compliance with the FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements".

Since that time, VHA and NAC have successfully executed two long-term, multiple-award 5-year contracts in support of the MSPV program.  In 2015, upon expiration of the second MSPV program, a set of bridge contracts were executed by the NAC extending the period of performance to April 19, 2016.  Those bridge contracts were as follows:  VA797N-15-C-0003, VA797N-15-C-0004, VA797N-15-C-0005, VA797N-15-C-0006, VA797N-15-C-0007, VA797N-15-C-0008, and VA797N-15-C-0009.  

In preparation for the continuation of the MSPV Program, the Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) assumed responsibility to award the new MSPV-NG contracts in 2014.  Due to a protest and continued technical evaluations, the SAC Contracting Officer determined that a second set of bridge contracts would be required to ensure continuity of services and the continuance of healthcare support throughout the VA community beyond the bridge contracts' expiration on April 19, 2016.  In February 2016, the SAC awarded the second set of bridge contracts.  They are as follows:  VA119-16-D-0007, VA119-16-D-0008, VA119-16-D-0009, VA119-16-D-0010, VA119-16-D-0011, VA119-16-D-0012, and VA119-16-D-0013.  The period of performance for the second SAC bridge contracts began April 20, 2016, and will expire no later than April 19, 2017.

Leveraging the NAC's lessons learned, VHA and SAC developed a procurement strategy for a complete VA-wide MSPV formulary of approved supplies by April 2016.  To execute this plan, VHA and SAC formed a team in February 2015, to initiate development of the MSPV-NG formulary.  The goal of this team was to solicit and award approximately 7,000 individual line-items, identified as an optimal initial level, for the pending MSPV-NG formulary.  The team developed a streamlined approach to solicit and award these items, which involved VHA providing salient characteristics for all 7,000 line-items, and SAC awarding competitive BPAs based on those salient characteristics.  

Between April 2015 and January 2016, VHA forwarded to SAC approximately 4,400 individual procurement packages consisting of both single and multiple line-items, of which approximately 3,500 were solicited and 900 returned to VHA for inclusion in future grouping efforts.  Although SAC issued multiple Requests for Quotations (RFQs), vendor response rates averaged less than 30 percent.  Due to lack of response, SAC and VHA sought input from industry via a series of MSPV-NG Industry Days.  When queried, industry partners indicated two main problems: (1) VHA's salient characteristics were flawed and/or insufficient.  They did not appear to be based on clinical input, and often cited unnecessary manufacturer-specific features.  This prohibited timely and quality responses, or no responses at all in many cases; (2) Industry also indicated the administrative burden of providing quotes for single-item BPA awards was not cost effective enough for them to provide quotes. 

In order to obtain a better success rate, and work on completing new MSPV-NG contracts, two possible strategies were identified:  (1) VHA created supply-line commodity teams, and began seeking clinical input for the development of salient characteristics.  Additionally, logical commodity groupings were developed; and (2) moving forward, VHA's Program Management Office was to group line-items by supply-line categories, or by United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes.  Supply-line categories were found to be the most favored by industry.  In an effort to validate this, a Request for Information (RFI) was issued to industry in February 2016.  The RFI results confirmed the supply-line category approach as the most appropriate method to solicit BPAs for item inclusion in the approved formulary.  

On February 24, 2016, awards were made to four MSPV-NG distributors, with an estimated performance starting 120 days after notice to proceed.  The period of performance under these contracts are scheduled to begin on August 20, 2016.  It was anticipated the distributors would have a full-line of 7,000 competitively awarded BPA formulary line-items to populate their electronic catalogs (e-catalog).  Due to lack of vendor response, the formulary fell short of the necessary items required to complete the Prime Vendor's e-catalog.  In an attempt to resolve the shortfall identified above, numerous changes in VA's strategy for populating the formulary were considered.  This directly resulted in the need to establish additional MSPV bridge distribution contracts to ensure continuation of service.  The MSPV bridge contracts were awarded with a start date of April 20, 2016.  This included a 3-month base period of performance, and three 3-month option periods.  The final period of performance expiration date is not-to-exceed 12 months.  

4.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The MSPV-NG formulary will consist of two tiers:  1) the 1,600 line items previously competed by the SAC and NAC, which is being automatically populated into the MSPV-NG formulary and estimated to be ready for use by October 2016; and 2) the additional VA FSS items identified by VHA to be procured under this LSJ.  This group includes the six (6) types of instruments and accessories distributed by 1st American Medical Distributor. The full list of items covered under this LSJ is as follows: 

Part Number	Item Description	Estimated Quantity
150-FT-Q	SYRINGE POWER INJECTOR 150ML SINGLE SYRINGE FASTURN W/FILL TUBE F/MARK V	299 CA of 50

The reprieve offered by this LSJ will allow VHA to continue placing orders under the MSPV-NG contracts on a temporary basis, and avoid an interruption in the healthcare supply chain while SAC pursues competitive procurements for the MSPV-NG formulary items.  

The proposed six (6) types of power injector syringes will be ordered under the authority of this LSJ.  These items have been identified as high-use medical items vital to the successful implementation of the MSPV-NG program.  VHA analyzed the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Medical Products Data Bank, focusing on the top high-volume purchases and identified six (6) types of critically needed medical supplies distributed by 1st American Medical Distributor.  Until the MSPV formulary is completed, VHA's ordering officers will be allowed to place orders for the required medical instruments and accessories.  The anticipated total value of the proposed BPA over the life of the agreement is $XX XXXXXXX.  The period of performance is not to exceed 12 months.  

5.  Statutory Authority and Supporting Rationale:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), an urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

6.  Rationale Supporting the Authority Cited Above:  Urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect the interest of the Government will not permit competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)". Significant adverse consequences will occur if the LSJ is not approved as the VA health care supply chain will be negatively impacted. Continuance of the MSPV Distribution Program is vital; any delay of distribution will directly impair the delivery of healthcare and services to approximately 9.5 million Veterans currently receiving care through the VA Healthcare System. A break in the health care supply chain will hinder or halt the delivery of essential medical, surgical, dental, and laboratory supplies and other contracted medical/surgical, cleaning, rescue and safety supplies and services used in the direct delivery of patient care.  

The VA Healthcare System receives approximately 40% of its medical and surgical supply support through the national MSPV Program.  Many of these items are standardized throughout the VA Healthcare System, and are a part of the formulary being developed for use in the VA. The formulary drives efficiency and familiarity in clinical practice which leads to improved patient outcomes and safety. It also decreases variation, thus reducing time to train and results in fewer errors when providing care. Standardization provides healthcare system benefits that are maximized because standardized items are interoperable. Facilities can then reinvest the savings earned into equipment and personnel that further enhance patient care.

Estimated cost reduction for purchase of individual items through the MSPV formulary is approximately $4M over the course of the twelve months proposed under this LSJ. The $4M estimate does not account for efficiencies in the ordering and inventory management processes. Overall annual inventory reduction specifically attributable to MSPV is estimated at approximately $40M.  

Disapproval of the LSJ will result in a disruption in the health care supply chain and negate these potential savings as facilities source supplies through other means.  Workload, man-hours, and cost of operations will increase as already depleting resources are lost and the agency will revert to the inefficient means of sourcing medical supplies as before the introduction of the national MSPV program in 2005.  Those inefficient methods include use of purchase cards and local VHA contracting.  

Use of purchase cards as an ordering method has shown to be more than 5 times the workload burden of using the delivery order method under the MSPV program.  In addition, there are approximately 2000 contracting staff in VHA, processing 576,134 formal contracting actions annually.  If the MSPV Ordering Officers were unable to place orders via MSPV, and those transactions were added to the workload of an already overburdened contracting staff, the result would be catastrophic.  

Lead times to procure these items through contracting for other than emergency orders are 45 days; emergency orders require action within three (3) days.  All orders would become emergencies to ensure timely delivery of healthcare to Veterans.  Canceled surgeries due to lengthy supply lead times would possibly become the norm, and thus, adversely affecting timely access to care.  Items critical to provide immediate care will be jeopardized, and will directly impact the safety and lives of Veterans.  

VA has a critical role in the comprehensive emergency response to support local, regional, or national emergencies or disasters.  VA is charged with the delivery and coordination of support missions for VA facilities affected by disasters, and also performs missions assigned to VA by FEMA or US Dept. of Health & Human Services for response to and recovery from nationally-declared emergencies and disasters.  The Prime Vendor Program is critical to ensure VA provides a full range of support to healthcare facilities to ensure resiliency, continuity and rapid recovery of healthcare services during disasters and other potential disruptions to healthcare service delivery.  VAMCs and other select Federal facilities are designated Federal Emergency Medical Facilities with significant contingency and emergency response roles.  Accordingly, the MSPVs provide emergency supply support during major catastrophic events.  Any interruption in the health care supply chain significantly jeopardizes the ability of VA to ensure minimum disruption to delivery of critical services in a contingency situation. This would directly impact healthcare delivery to our nation's Veterans.

Other alternatives were considered, including using both the legacy bridge contracts, and the MSPV contract concurrently until all of the required items can be competitively awarded.  The confusion this would create in the field is insurmountable, as field staff will face the uncertainty of which contracts to use and when.   A well-coordinated supply chain is necessary to ensure facilities are supported, and Veterans are cared for timely.  There are no reasonable alternatives that would adequately address the circumstances presented. Any financial costs incurred by the Government to execute the BPAs under the authority of the LSJ, and any potential costs or cost avoidance not realized through competition would not outweigh the benefits received through continuance of the health care supply chain. Approval of the LSJ is in the best interests of the Government and is justified by the urgency of the circumstances. 

The cost to the Government if the LSJ is not approved would not be primarily financial, although it is significant. The non-monetary costs of the health, welfare and safety of millions of Veterans cannot be quantified.  Every effort was made to compare these costs, benefits and other options; the VA cannot rationally find any other reasonable or timely alternative.

VA considered the cost to the integrity of the procurement system and VA acknowledges the importance of protecting the integrity of the procurement system. However, VA feels this is an extraordinary situation, and maintains that due to an already constricted schedule, and the significant impact of these BPAs on the delivery of medical and surgical supplies and services to millions of Veterans, the facts of this case justify the unusual measure proposed under this LSJ.  VA considered the balance of the integrity of the procurement system, and the interest of the Government and determined that the issuance of the BPAs under the authority of this LSJ is mitigated and justified.  A break in the health care supply chain will be costly and detrimentally disruptive to VA operations and delivery of critical healthcare services to 9.5 million Veterans. Items procured under the authority of this LSJ will be included in the MSPV supply chain for a maximum period of twelve months until the item can be competitively awarded.  At such time the item will be removed from the supply chain and replaced with the competitively awarded functional equivalent.

This action is vital to support VA's nationwide healthcare system and prevent disruptions to Veteran care.  The identified medical items represent supplies collectively determined essential by VHA medical centers to meet VA patient care needs.  Continued use of these products and source of supply will ensure timely delivery and minimize VA supply chain interruptions.  The vendor for these items was selected through use of data analytics tools and the Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB).  

The MSPV-NG program is the primary means to obtain medical supplies; these items are regarded as critical to patient care.  These items are currently available under the legacy MSPV contracts.  Failure to make them available under MSPV-NG would have catastrophic effects on the field's ability to support medical centers.  Each item would have to be purchased individually either via purchase card, or through local VHA Contracting Offices, with lead times of up to 45 days.  VHA Logistics and Contracting do not have the capacity to meet the constant throughput of high cost/high volume daily individual orders required to meet clinical care needs.  Bottlenecks resulting from capacity issues would result in insufficient inventory to meet critical needs for Veteran patients, and will have a significant patient safety impact.  It is imperative that VA transition from the present way of doing business under the current MSPV program to the new and revised mandatory MSPV-NG program.  In executing this change the following improvements will be realized:

a.	The MSPV distributors shall not ship any medical/surgical or any other supplies that are not on the Government-provided MSPV-NG formulary of approved medical/surgical supplies.
b.	The MSPV distributors shall not charge any VA formulary approved suppliers to handle their product in conjunction with the contract.
c.	The Government mandates all distributors to be Electronic Data Interchange compliant and it is in the BPAs/contracts. 
d.	The MSPV distributors shall not require product suppliers to carry liability insurance in excess of $1,000,000, charge tracking fees, and/or require additional discounts from product suppliers.
 
7.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  MSPV distribution contracts were awarded on February 24, 2016, and performance is scheduled to begin October 2016.  The MSPV distributors require VA's formulary in order to fulfill the medical requirements at VA hospitals and clinics.  As stated previously, the Government intends to compete all line items within the next 12 months.  Market research shows there is adequate competition in support of the new requirements.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2), these actions will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO).  

8.  Determination of Best Value:  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d), the prices for supplies offered on FSS have already been determined to be fair and reasonable by NAC Contracting Officers.  Given VHA's critical need for the previously identified formulary supplies, and the short turn-around time until the MSPV-NG formulary is fully implemented, VA intends to select the lowest published FSS vendor and seek additional discounts.  To compete these items would result in unacceptable delays, and potential mission failure.  In the future, additional discounts will be sought through competition for these products as part of the transition to the MSPV-NG formulary.  

9.  Market Research:  The market research conducted for the MSPV-NG requirement showed there are multiple suppliers capable of providing medical products however; performance is required by July 2016, and VA does not have adequate resources for timely completion of the required items. VA has a need to have consistent, uninterrupted sources of supply that meets system-wide requirements without compromising direct patient care to VA medical centers and/or related facilities.  VA has a plan to compete these items and market research supports this acquisition strategy.  

10.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:  SAC is currently establishing competitive single-award BPAs that are beginning to populate the MSPV-NG formulary.  Competition is on-going; however, at the onset of MSPV-NG's period of performance, the formulary will not have sufficient breadth of medical products to meet the operational needs of VA.  It is anticipated the MSPV-NG distributors will begin accepting and delivering orders on approximately October 2016, for all items covered in this LSJ. 

11. Actions to Increase Competition:  As described above, VA will compete future requirements and continuously add necessary products to the MSPV-NG formulary.  SAC will work with VHA's program office to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions.  VA has and will continue to meet with industry on a periodic basis for continued input and feedback on acquisition strategies.  All future acquisitions of MSPV BPAs will be solicited and awarded in a manner that promotes competition to greatest extent practicable.

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for catheters, kits, and fasteners under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.406-6, "Limited Sources". The required items are distributed by Americare, LLC, a small business, located at 1256 Oakbrook Drive, Suite D, Norcross, GA, 30093.  These items will be procured via VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) V797P-4235B to populate the MSPV formulary with mandatory health care supplies.  The MSPV formulary is a list of approved healthcare commodities including medical, surgical, dental, laboratory, facilities/cleaning products, and textiles.  This LSJ will supply the MSPV formulary with catheters supplied by Americare on a not-to-exceed 12-month period of performance until these items can be competed in accordance with FAR 8.405-3.  As the identified required items are competed, they will no longer be acquired under the LSJ; thus, bringing the MSPV formulary in compliance with the FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements".

3.  Acquisition History:  VHA manages the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.  In 2013, the system consisted of 21 Veterans Integrated Services Networks with approximately 150 medical centers, 820 outpatient clinics, and various other facilities to include Community Living Centers, Veteran Centers and Domiciliaries.  Together, these health care facilities, and the more than 53,000 independent licensed health care practitioners who work within them, provide comprehensive care to about 9.3 million enrolled Veterans.  The MSPV Program is the primary means to obtain medical and surgical supply support for the VA healthcare system through contract support.  VHA, in cooperation with VA's National Acquisition Center (NAC), initiated contract support for the MSPV program in 2005.  The result was the first generation of seven prime vendor distributor contracts that not only support VHA, but also support the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of State, Indian Health Service, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Since that time, VHA and NAC have successfully executed two long-term, multiple-award 5-year contracts in support of the MSPV program.  In 2015, upon expiration of the second MSPV program, a set of bridge contracts were executed by the NAC extending the period of performance to April 19, 2016.  Those bridge contracts were as follows:  VA797N-15-C-0003, VA797N-15-C-0004, VA797N-15-C-0005, VA797N-15-C-0006, VA797N-15-C-0007, VA797N-15-C-0008, and VA797N-15-C-0009.  

In preparation for the continuation of the MSPV Program, the Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) assumed responsibility to award the new MSPV contracts in 2014.  Due to a protest and continued technical evaluations, the SAC Contracting Officer determined that a second set of bridge contracts would be required to ensure continuity of services and the continuance of healthcare support throughout the VA community beyond the bridge contracts' expiration on April 19, 2016.  In February 2016, the SAC awarded the second set of bridge contracts.  They are as follows:  VA119-16-D-0007, VA119-16-D-0008, VA119-16-D-0009, VA119-16-D-0010, VA119-16-D-0011, VA119-16-D-0012, and VA119-16-D-0013.  The period of performance for the second SAC bridge contracts began April 20, 2016, and will expire no later than April 19, 2017.

Leveraging the NAC's lessons learned, VHA and SAC developed a procurement strategy for a complete VA-wide MSPV formulary of approved supplies by April 2016.  To execute this plan, VHA and SAC formed a team in February 2015, to initiate development of the MSPV formulary.  The goal of this team was to solicit and award approximately 7,000 individual line-items, identified as an optimal initial level, for the pending MSPV formulary.  The team developed a streamlined approach to solicit and award these items, which involved VHA providing salient characteristics for all 7,000 line-items, and SAC awarding competitive BPAs based on those salient characteristics.  

Between April 2015 and January 2016, VHA forwarded to SAC approximately 4,400 individual procurement packages consisting of both single and multiple line-items, of which approximately 3,500 were solicited and 900 returned to VHA for inclusion in future grouping efforts.  Although SAC issued multiple Requests for Quotations (RFQs), vendor response rates averaged less than 30 percent.  Due to lack of response, SAC and VHA sought input from industry via a series of MSPV Industry Days.  When queried, industry partners indicated two main problems: (1) VHA's salient characteristics were flawed and/or insufficient.  They did not appear to be based on clinical input, and often cited unnecessary manufacturer-specific features.  This prohibited timely and quality responses, or no responses at all in many cases; (2) Industry also indicated the administrative burden of providing quotes for single-item BPA awards was not cost effective enough for them to provide quotes. 

In order to obtain a better success rate, and work on completing new MSPV contracts, two possible strategies were identified:  (1) VHA created supply-line commodity teams, and began seeking clinical input for the development of salient characteristics.  Additionally, logical commodity groupings were developed; and (2) moving forward, VHA's Program Management Office was to group line-items by supply-line categories, or by United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes.

The RFI results confirmed the supply-line category approach as the most appropriate method to solicit BPAs for item inclusion in the approved formulary.  

On February 24, 2016, awards were made to four MSPV distributors, with an estimated performance starting 120 days after notice to proceed.  The period of performance under these contracts are scheduled to begin October 2016.  It was anticipated the distributors would have a full-line of 7,000 competitively awarded BPA formulary line-items to populate their electronic catalogs (e-catalog).  Due to lack of vendor response, the formulary fell short of the necessary items required to complete the Prime Vendor's e-catalog.  In an attempt to resolve the shortfall identified above, numerous changes in VA's strategy for populating the formulary were considered.  This directly resulted in the need to establish additional MSPV bridge distribution contracts to ensure continuation of service.  The MSPV bridge contracts were awarded with a start date in April 2016.  This included a 3-month base period of performance, and three 3-month option periods.  The final period of performance expiration date is not-to-exceed 12 months.  

4.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The MSPV formulary will consist of two tiers:  1) the 1,600 line items previously competed by the SAC and NAC, which is being automatically populated into the MSPV formulary and estimated to be ready for use by August 20, 2016; and 2) the additional VA FSS items identified by VHA to be procured under this LSJ.  This group includes the catheters, kits and fasteners distributed by Americare. The items covered under this LSJ are as follows:

Italicized items were not on the initial RFQ, but, added by the Contractor during the procurement phase.

The reprieve offered by this LSJ will allow VHA to continue placing orders under the MSPV contracts on a temporary basis and avoid an interruption in the healthcare supply chain while SAC pursues competitive procurements for the MSPV formulary items.  

The required medical supplies will be ordered under the authority of this LSJ.  These items have been identified as high-use medical items vital to the successful implementation of the MSPV program.  VHA analyzed the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Medical Products Data Bank, focusing on the top high-volume purchases and identified 46 types of critically needed catheters distributed by Americare.  During the procurement phase, Americare provided quotes for an additional twenty (20) line items on their VA FSS. The Contractor identified the additional items as "high use" frequently ordered items, commonly ordered in conjunction with the initially proposed items. Four (4) of the Contractor added items are priced higher than the current FSS and were removed from consideration. Americare explained that they submitted a price change for these items; the request is currently pending at the NAC. The Contracting Officer determined that the inclusion of the remaining sixteen (16) items is in the best interest of the Government.  The items were further categorized into two separate actions:  "Catheter Kits and Fasteners" and "SureStep and StatLock Stabilization Devices".  This LSJ has been updated accordingly to account for the "Catheter Kits and Fasteners". The Contractor was cautioned that the VHA Program Office and the Contracting Officer will determine the viability of all items for inclusion in the MSPV catalog.  If accepted, all items quoted will be considered, in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation, for inclusion in the proposed BPA.  

Until the MSPV formulary is completed, VHA's ordering officers will be allowed to the agreement is $XXXXXXXXXX.  The period of performance is not to exceed 12 months.  

5.  Statutory Authority and Supporting Rationale:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), Urgent and Compelling. 

6.  Rationale Supporting the Authority Cited Above:  Urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect the interest of the Government will not permit competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)". Significant adverse consequences will occur if the LSJ is not approved as the VA health care supply chain will be negatively impacted. Continuance of the MSPV Distribution Program is vital; any delay of distribution will directly impair the delivery of healthcare and services to approximately 9.5 million Veterans currently receiving care through the VA Healthcare System. A break in the health care supply chain will hinder or halt the delivery of essential medical, surgical, dental, and laboratory supplies and other contracted medical/surgical, cleaning, rescue and safety supplies and services used in the direct delivery of patient care.  

The VA Healthcare System receives approximately 40% of its medical and surgical supply support through the national MSPV Program.  Many of these items are standardized throughout the VA Healthcare System, and are a part of the formulary being developed for use in the VA. The formulary drives efficiency and familiarity in clinical practice which leads to improved patient outcomes and safety. It also decreases variation, thus reducing time to train and results in fewer errors when providing care. Standardization provides healthcare system benefits that are maximized because standardized items are interoperable. Facilities can then reinvest the savings earned into equipment and personnel that further enhance patient care.

Estimated cost reduction for purchase of individual items through the MSPV formulary is approximately $4M over the course of the twelve months proposed under this LSJ. The $4M estimate does not account for efficiencies in the ordering and inventory management processes. Overall annual inventory reduction specifically attributable to MSPV is estimated at approximately $40M.  

Disapproval of the LSJ will result in a disruption in the health care supply chain and negate these potential savings as facilities source supplies through other means.  Workload, man-hours, and cost of operations will increase as already depleting resources are lost and the agency will revert to the inefficient means of sourcing medical supplies as before the introduction of the national MSPV program in 2005.  Those inefficient methods include use of purchase cards and local VHA contracting.  

Use of purchase cards as an ordering method has shown to be more than 5 times the workload burden of using the delivery order method under the MSPV program.  In addition, there are approximately 2000 contracting staff in VHA, processing 576,134 formal contracting actions annually.  If the MSPV Ordering Officers were unable to place orders via MSPV, and those transactions were added to the workload of an already overburdened contracting staff, the result would be catastrophic.  

Lead times to procure these items through contracting for other than emergency orders are 45 days; emergency orders require action within three days.  All orders would become emergencies to ensure timely delivery of healthcare to Veterans.  C canceled surgeries due to lengthy supply lead times would possibly become the norm, and thus, adversely affecting timely access to care.  Items critical to provide immediate care will be jeopardized, and will directly impact the safety and lives of Veterans.  

VA has a critical role in the comprehensive emergency response to support local, regional, or national emergencies or disasters.  VA is charged with the delivery and coordination of support missions for VA facilities affected by disasters, and also performs missions assigned to VA by FEMA or US Dept. of Health & Human Services for response to and recovery from nationally-declared emergencies and disasters.  The Prime Vendor Program is critical to ensure VA provides a full range of support to healthcare facilities to ensure resiliency, continuity and rapid recovery of healthcare services during disasters and other potential disruptions to healthcare service delivery.  VAMCs and other select Federal facilities are designated Federal Emergency Medical Facilities with significant contingency and emergency response roles.  Accordingly, the MSPVs provide emergency supply support during major catastrophic events.  Any interruption in the health care supply chain significantly jeopardizes the ability of VA to ensure minimum disruption to delivery of critical services in a contingency situation. This would directly impact healthcare delivery to our nation's Veterans.

Other alternatives were considered, including using both the legacy bridge contracts, and the MSPV contract concurrently until all of the required items can be competitively awarded.  The confusion this would create in the field is insurmountable, as field staff will face the uncertainty of which contracts to use and when.   A well-coordinated supply chain is necessary to ensure facilities are supported, and Veterans are cared for timely.  There are no reasonable alternatives that would adequately address the circumstances presented. Any financial costs incurred by the Government to execute the BPAs under the authority of the LSJ, and any potential costs or cost avoidance not realized through competition would not outweigh the benefits received through continuance of the health care supply chain. Approval of the LSJ is in the best interests of the Government and is justified by the urgency of the circumstances. 

The cost to the Government if the LSJ is not approved would not be primarily financial, although it is significant. The non-monetary costs of the health, welfare and safety of millions of Veterans cannot be quantified.  Every effort was made to compare these costs, benefits and other options; the VA cannot rationally find any other reasonable or timely alternative.

VA considered the cost to the integrity of the procurement system and VA acknowledges the importance of protecting the integrity of the procurement system. However, VA feels this is an extraordinary situation, and maintains that due to an already constricted schedule, and the significant impact of these BPAs on the delivery of medical and surgical supplies and services to millions of Veterans, the facts of this case justify the unusual measure proposed under this LSJ.  VA considered the balance of the integrity of the procurement system, and the interest of the Government and determined that the issuance of the BPAs under the authority of this LSJ is mitigated and justified.  A break in the health care supply chain will be costly and detrimentally disruptive to VA operations and delivery of critical healthcare services to 9.5 million Veterans. Items procured under the authority of this LSJ will be included in the MSPV supply chain for a maximum period of twelve months until the item can be competitively awarded.  At such time the item will be removed from the supply chain and replaced with the competitively awarded functional equivalent.

This action is vital to support VA's nationwide healthcare system and prevent disruptions to Veteran care.  The identified medical items represent supplies collectively determined essential by VHA medical centers to meet VA patient care needs.  Continued use of these products and source of supply will ensure timely delivery and minimize VA supply chain interruptions.  The vendor for these items was selected through use of data analytics tools and the Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB).  

The MSPV program is the primary means to obtain medical supplies; these items are regarded as critical to patient care.  These items are currently available under the legacy MSPV contracts.  Failure to make them available under MSPV would have catastrophic effects on the field's ability to support medical centers.  Each item would have to be purchased individually either via purchase card, or through local VHA Contracting Offices, with lead times of up to 45 days.  VHA Logistics and Contracting do not have the capacity to meet the constant throughput of high cost/high volume daily individual orders required to meet clinical care needs.  Bottlenecks resulting from capacity issues would result in insufficient inventory to meet critical needs for Veteran patients, and will have a significant patient safety impact.  It is imperative that VA transition from the present way of doing business under the current MSPV program to the new and revised mandatory MSPV program.  In executing this change the following improvements will be realized:

a.	The MSPV distributors shall not ship any medical/surgical or any other supplies that are not on the Government-provided MSPV formulary of approved medical/surgical supplies.
b.	The MSPV distributors shall not charge any VA formulary approved suppliers to handle their product in conjunction with the contract.
c.	The Government mandates all distributors to be Electronic Data Interchange compliant and it is in the BPAs/contracts. 
d.	The MSPV distributors shall not require product suppliers to carry liability insurance in excess of $1,000,000, charge tracking fees, and/or require additional discounts from product suppliers.
 
7.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  MSPV distribution contracts were awarded on February 24, 2016, and performance is scheduled to begin in October 2016.  The MSPV distributors require VA's formulary in order to fulfill the medical requirements at VA hospitals and clinics.  As stated previously, the Government intends to compete all line items within the next 12 months.  Market research shows there is adequate competition in support of the new requirements.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2), these actions will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO).  

8.  Determination of Best Value:  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d), the prices for supplies offered on FSS have already been determined to be fair and reasonable by NAC Contracting Officers.  Given VHA's critical need for the previously identified formulary supplies, and the short turn-around time until the MSPV formulary is fully implemented, VA intends to select the lowest published FSS vendor and seek additional discounts.  To compete these items would result in unacceptable delays, and potential mission failure.  In the future, additional discounts will be sought through competition for these products as part of the transition to the MSPV formulary.  

9.  Market Research:  The market research conducted for the MSPV requirement showed there are multiple suppliers capable of providing medical products however; performance is required by October 2016, and VA does not have adequate resources for timely completion of the required items. VA has a need to have consistent, uninterrupted sources of supply that meets system-wide requirements without compromising direct patient care to VA medical centers and/or related facilities.  VA has a plan to compete these items and market research supports this acquisition strategy.  

10.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:  SAC is currently establishing competitive single-award BPAs that are beginning to populate the MSPV formulary.  Competition is on-going; however, at the onset of MSPV's period of performance, the formulary will not have sufficient breadth of medical products to meet the operational needs of VA.  It is anticipated the MSPV distributors will begin accepting and delivering orders in October 2016 for all items covered in this LSJ. 

11. Actions to Increase Competition:  As described above, VA will compete future requirements and continuously add necessary products to the MSPV formulary.  SAC will work with VHA's program office to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions.  VA has and will continue to meet with industry on a periodic basis for continued input and feedback on acquisition strategies.  All future acquisitions of MSPV BPAs will be solicited and awarded in a manner that promotes competition to greatest extent practicable.

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for catheters under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.406-6, "Limited Sources". The required items are distributed by Americare, LLC, a small business, located at 1256 Oakbrook Drive, Suite D, Norcross, GA, 30093.  These items will be procured via VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) V797P-4235B to populate the MSPV formulary with mandatory health care supplies.  The MSPV formulary is a list of approved healthcare commodities including medical, surgical, dental, laboratory, facilities/cleaning products, and textiles.  This LSJ will supply the MSPV formulary with catheters supplied by Americare on a not-to-exceed 12-month period of performance until these items can be competed in accordance with FAR 8.405-3.  As the identified required items are competed, they will no longer be acquired under the LSJ; thus, bringing the MSPV formulary in compliance with the FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements".

3.  Acquisition History:  VHA manages the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.  In 2013, the system consisted of 21 Veterans Integrated Services Networks with approximately 150 medical centers, 820 outpatient clinics, and various other facilities to include Community Living Centers, Veteran Centers and Domiciliaries.  Together, these health care facilities, and the more than 53,000 independent licensed health care practitioners who work within them, provide comprehensive care to about 9.3 million enrolled Veterans.  The MSPV Program is the primary means to obtain medical and surgical supply support for the VA healthcare system through contract support.  VHA, in cooperation with VA's National Acquisition Center (NAC), initiated contract support for the MSPV program in 2005.  The result was the first generation of seven prime vendor distributor contracts that not only support VHA, but also support the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of State, Indian Health Service, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Since that time, VHA and NAC have successfully executed two long-term, multiple-award 5-year contracts in support of the MSPV program.  In 2015, upon expiration of the second MSPV program, a set of bridge contracts were executed by the NAC extending the period of performance to April 19, 2016.  Those bridge contracts were as follows:  VA797N-15-C-0003, VA797N-15-C-0004, VA797N-15-C-0005, VA797N-15-C-0006, VA797N-15-C-0007, VA797N-15-C-0008, and VA797N-15-C-0009.  

In preparation for the continuation of the MSPV Program, the Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) assumed responsibility to award the new MSPV contracts in 2014.  Due to a protest and continued technical evaluations, the SAC Contracting Officer determined that a second set of bridge contracts would be required to ensure continuity of services and the continuance of healthcare support throughout the VA community beyond the bridge contracts' expiration on April 19, 2016.  In February 2016, the SAC awarded the second set of bridge contracts.  They are as follows:  VA119-16-D-0007, VA119-16-D-0008, VA119-16-D-0009, VA119-16-D-0010, VA119-16-D-0011, VA119-16-D-0012, and VA119-16-D-0013.  The period of performance for the second SAC bridge contracts began April 20, 2016, and will expire no later than April 19, 2017.

Leveraging the NAC's lessons learned, VHA and SAC developed a procurement strategy for a complete VA-wide MSPV formulary of approved supplies by April 2016.  To execute this plan, VHA and SAC formed a team in February 2015, to initiate development of the MSPV formulary.  The goal of this team was to solicit and award approximately 7,000 individual line-items, identified as an optimal initial level, for the pending MSPV formulary.  The team developed a streamlined approach to solicit and award these items, which involved VHA providing salient characteristics for all 7,000 line-items, and SAC awarding competitive BPAs based on those salient characteristics.  

Between April 2015 and January 2016, VHA forwarded to SAC approximately 4,400 individual procurement packages consisting of both single and multiple line-items, of which approximately 3,500 were solicited and 900 returned to VHA for inclusion in future grouping efforts.  Although SAC issued multiple Requests for Quotations (RFQs), vendor response rates averaged less than 30 percent.  Due to lack of response, SAC and VHA sought input from industry via a series of MSPV Industry Days.  When queried, industry partners indicated two main problems: (1) VHA's salient characteristics were flawed and/or insufficient.  They did not appear to be based on clinical input, and often cited unnecessary manufacturer-specific features.  This prohibited timely and quality responses, or no responses at all in many cases; (2) Industry also indicated the administrative burden of providing quotes for single-item BPA awards was not cost effective enough for them to provide quotes. 

In order to obtain a better success rate, and work on completing new MSPV contracts, two possible strategies were identified:  (1) VHA created supply-line commodity teams, and began seeking clinical input for the development of salient characteristics.  Additionally, logical commodity groupings were developed; and (2) moving forward, VHA's Program Management Office was to group line-items by supply-line categories, or by United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes.  Supply-line categories were found to be the most favored by industry.  In an effort to validate this, a Request for Information (RFI) was issued to industry in February 2016.  The RFI results confirmed the supply-line category approach as the most appropriate method to solicit BPAs for item inclusion in the approved formulary.  

On February 24, 2016, awards were made to four MSPV distributors, with an estimated performance starting 120 days after notice to proceed.  The period of performance under these contracts are scheduled to begin October 2016.  It was anticipated the distributors would have a full-line of 7,000 competitively awarded BPA formulary line-items to populate their electronic catalogs (e-catalog).  Due to lack of vendor response, the formulary fell short of the necessary items required to complete the Prime Vendor's e-catalog.  In an attempt to resolve the shortfall identified above, numerous changes in VA's strategy for populating the formulary were considered.  This directly resulted in the need to establish additional MSPV bridge distribution contracts to ensure continuation of service.  The MSPV bridge contracts were awarded with a start date in April 2016.  This included a 3-month base period of performance, and three 3-month option periods.  The final period of performance expiration date is not-to-exceed 12 months.  

4.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The MSPV formulary will consist of two tiers:  1) the 1,600 line items previously competed by the SAC and NAC, which is being automatically populated into the MSPV formulary and estimated to be ready for use by August 20, 2016; and 2) the additional VA FSS items identified by VHA to be procured under this LSJ.  This group includes the catheters distributed by Americare. The items covered under this LSJ are as follows:

Italicized items were not on the initial RFQ, but, added by the Contractor during the procurement phase.

The reprieve offered by this LSJ will allow VHA to continue placing orders under the MSPV contracts on a temporary basis and avoid an interruption in the healthcare supply chain while SAC pursues competitive procurements for the MSPV formulary items.  

The required medical supplies will be ordered under the authority of this LSJ.  These items have been identified as high-use medical items vital to the successful implementation of the MSPV program.  VHA analyzed the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Medical Products Data Bank, focusing on the top high-volume purchases and identified 46 types of critically needed catheters distributed by Americare.  During the procurement phase, Americare provided quotes for an additional twenty (20) line items on their VA FSS. The Contractor identified the additional items as "high use" frequently ordered items, commonly ordered in conjunction with the initially proposed items. Four (4) of the Contractor added items are priced higher than the current FSS and were removed from consideration. Americare explained that they submitted a price change for these items; the request is currently pending at the NAC. The Contracting Officer determined that the inclusion of the remaining sixteen (16) items is in the best interest of the Government.  The items were further categorized into two actions: "Catheters, Kits and Fasteners" and "SureStep and StatLock Stabilization Devices".  This LSJ has been updated accordingly to account for the following "SureStep and StatLock Stabilization Devices".

The Contractor was cautioned that the VHA Program Office and the Contracting Officer will determine the viability of all items for inclusion in the MSPV catalog.  If accepted, all items quoted will be considered, in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation, for inclusion in the proposed BPA.  

Until the MSPV formulary is completed, VHA's ordering officers will be allowed to the agreement is $XXXXXXXXXX.  The period of performance is not to exceed 12 months.  

5.  Statutory Authority and Supporting Rationale:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), Urgent and Compelling. 

6.  Rationale Supporting the Authority Cited Above:  Urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect the interest of the Government will not permit competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)". Significant adverse consequences will occur if the LSJ is not approved as the VA health care supply chain will be negatively impacted. Continuance of the MSPV Distribution Program is vital; any delay of distribution will directly impair the delivery of healthcare and services to approximately 9.5 million Veterans currently receiving care through the VA Healthcare System. A break in the health care supply chain will hinder or halt the delivery of essential medical, surgical, dental, and laboratory supplies and other contracted medical/surgical, cleaning, rescue and safety supplies and services used in the direct delivery of patient care.  

The VA Healthcare System receives approximately 40% of its medical and surgical supply support through the national MSPV Program.  Many of these items are standardized throughout the VA Healthcare System, and are a part of the formulary being developed for use in the VA. The formulary drives efficiency and familiarity in clinical practice which leads to improved patient outcomes and safety. It also decreases variation, thus reducing time to train and results in fewer errors when providing care. Standardization provides healthcare system benefits that are maximized because standardized items are interoperable. Facilities can then reinvest the savings earned into equipment and personnel that further enhance patient care.

Estimated cost reduction for purchase of individual items through the MSPV formulary is approximately $4M over the course of the twelve months proposed under this LSJ. The $4M estimate does not account for efficiencies in the ordering and inventory management processes. Overall annual inventory reduction specifically attributable to MSPV is estimated at approximately $40M.  

Disapproval of the LSJ will result in a disruption in the health care supply chain and negate these potential savings as facilities source supplies through other means.  Workload, man-hours, and cost of operations will increase as already depleting resources are lost and the agency will revert to the inefficient means of sourcing medical supplies as before the introduction of the national MSPV program in 2005.  Those inefficient methods include use of purchase cards and local VHA contracting.  

Use of purchase cards as an ordering method has shown to be more than 5 times the workload burden of using the delivery order method under the MSPV program.  In addition, there are approximately 2000 contracting staff in VHA, processing 576,134 formal contracting actions annually.  If the MSPV Ordering Officers were unable to place orders via MSPV, and those transactions were added to the workload of an already overburdened contracting staff, the result would be catastrophic.  

Lead times to procure these items through contracting for other than emergency orders are 45 days; emergency orders require action within three days.  All orders would become emergencies to ensure timely delivery of healthcare to Veterans.  C canceled surgeries due to lengthy supply lead times would possibly become the norm, and thus, adversely affecting timely access to care.  Items critical to provide immediate care will be jeopardized, and will directly impact the safety and lives of Veterans.  

VA has a critical role in the comprehensive emergency response to support local, regional, or national emergencies or disasters.  VA is charged with the delivery and coordination of support missions for VA facilities affected by disasters, and also performs missions assigned to VA by FEMA or US Dept. of Health & Human Services for response to and recovery from nationally-declared emergencies and disasters.  The Prime Vendor Program is critical to ensure VA provides a full range of support to healthcare facilities to ensure resiliency, continuity and rapid recovery of healthcare services during disasters and other potential disruptions to healthcare service delivery.  VAMCs and other select Federal facilities are designated Federal Emergency Medical Facilities with significant contingency and emergency response roles.  Accordingly, the MSPVs provide emergency supply support during major catastrophic events.  Any interruption in the health care supply chain significantly jeopardizes the ability of VA to ensure minimum disruption to delivery of critical services in a contingency situation. This would directly impact healthcare delivery to our nation's Veterans.

Other alternatives were considered, including using both the legacy bridge contracts, and the MSPV contract concurrently until all of the required items can be competitively awarded.  The confusion this would create in the field is insurmountable, as field staff will face the uncertainty of which contracts to use and when.   A well-coordinated supply chain is necessary to ensure facilities are supported, and Veterans are cared for timely.  There are no reasonable alternatives that would adequately address the circumstances presented. Any financial costs incurred by the Government to execute the BPAs under the authority of the LSJ, and any potential costs or cost avoidance not realized through competition would not outweigh the benefits received through continuance of the health care supply chain. Approval of the LSJ is in the best interests of the Government and is justified by the urgency of the circumstances. 

The cost to the Government if the LSJ is not approved would not be primarily financial, although it is significant. The non-monetary costs of the health, welfare and safety of millions of Veterans cannot be quantified.  Every effort was made to compare these costs, benefits and other options; the VA cannot rationally find any other reasonable or timely alternative.

VA considered the cost to the integrity of the procurement system and VA acknowledges the importance of protecting the integrity of the procurement system. However, VA feels this is an extraordinary situation, and maintains that due to an already constricted schedule, and the significant impact of these BPAs on the delivery of medical and surgical supplies and services to millions of Veterans, the facts of this case justify the unusual measure proposed under this LSJ.  VA considered the balance of the integrity of the procurement system, and the interest of the Government and determined that the issuance of the BPAs under the authority of this LSJ is mitigated and justified.  A break in the health care supply chain will be costly and detrimentally disruptive to VA operations and delivery of critical healthcare services to 9.5 million Veterans. Items procured under the authority of this LSJ will be included in the MSPV supply chain for a maximum period of twelve months until the item can be competitively awarded.  At such time the item will be removed from the supply chain and replaced with the competitively awarded functional equivalent.

This action is vital to support VA's nationwide healthcare system and prevent disruptions to Veteran care.  The identified medical items represent supplies collectively determined essential by VHA medical centers to meet VA patient care needs.  Continued use of these products and source of supply will ensure timely delivery and minimize VA supply chain interruptions.  The vendor for these items was selected through use of data analytics tools and the Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB).  

The MSPV program is the primary means to obtain medical supplies; these items are regarded as critical to patient care.  These items are currently available under the legacy MSPV contracts.  Failure to make them available under MSPV would have catastrophic effects on the field's ability to support medical centers.  Each item would have to be purchased individually either via purchase card, or through local VHA Contracting Offices, with lead times of up to 45 days.  VHA Logistics and Contracting do not have the capacity to meet the constant throughput of high cost/high volume daily individual orders required to meet clinical care needs.  Bottlenecks resulting from capacity issues would result in insufficient inventory to meet critical needs for Veteran patients, and will have a significant patient safety impact.  It is imperative that VA transition from the present way of doing business under the current MSPV program to the new and revised mandatory MSPV program.  In executing this change the following improvements will be realized:

a.	The MSPV distributors shall not ship any medical/surgical or any other supplies that are not on the Government-provided MSPV formulary of approved medical/surgical supplies.
b.	The MSPV distributors shall not charge any VA formulary approved suppliers to handle their product in conjunction with the contract.
c.	The Government mandates all distributors to be Electronic Data Interchange compliant and it is in the BPAs/contracts. 
d.	The MSPV distributors shall not require product suppliers to carry liability insurance in excess of $1,000,000, charge tracking fees, and/or require additional discounts from product suppliers.
 
7.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  MSPV distribution contracts were awarded on February 24, 2016, and performance is scheduled to begin in October 2016.  The MSPV distributors require VA's formulary in order to fulfill the medical requirements at VA hospitals and clinics.  As stated previously, the Government intends to compete all line items within the next 12 months.  Market research shows there is adequate competition in support of the new requirements.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2), these actions will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO).  

8.  Determination of Best Value:  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d), the prices for supplies offered on FSS have already been determined to be fair and reasonable by NAC Contracting Officers.  Given VHA's critical need for the previously identified formulary supplies, and the short turn-around time until the MSPV formulary is fully implemented, VA intends to select the lowest published FSS vendor and seek additional discounts.  To compete these items would result in unacceptable delays, and potential mission failure.  In the future, additional discounts will be sought through competition for these products as part of the transition to the MSPV formulary.  

9.  Market Research:  The market research conducted for the MSPV requirement showed there are multiple suppliers capable of providing medical products however; performance is required by October 2016, and VA does not have adequate resources for timely completion of the required items. VA has a need to have consistent, uninterrupted sources of supply that meets system-wide requirements without compromising direct patient care to VA medical centers and/or related facilities.  VA has a plan to compete these items and market research supports this acquisition strategy.  

10.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:  SAC is currently establishing competitive single-award BPAs that are beginning to populate the MSPV formulary.  Competition is on-going; however, at the onset of MSPV's period of performance, the formulary will not have sufficient breadth of medical products to meet the operational needs of VA.  It is anticipated the MSPV distributors will begin accepting and delivering orders in October 2016 for all items covered in this LSJ. 

11. Actions to Increase Competition:  As described above, VA will compete future requirements and continuously add necessary products to the MSPV formulary.  SAC will work with VHA's program office to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions.  VA has and will continue to meet with industry on a periodic basis for continued input and feedback on acquisition strategies.  All future acquisitions of MSPV BPAs will be solicited and awarded in a manner that promotes competition to greatest extent practicable.

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for Caviwipes and Cavicide, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6, "Limited Sources". The required items are supplied by Avkare, Inc., a Small Business, located at 615 N 1 St. Pulaski, TN 38478. These items will be procured via VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) V797P-4076B to populate the MSPV-NG formulary with mandatory health care supplies.  The MSPV-NG formulary is a list of approved healthcare commodities including medical, surgical, dental, laboratory, facilities/cleaning products, and textiles.  This LSJ will supply the MSPV-NG formulary with medical supplies and accessories distributed by Avkare on a not-to-exceed 12-month period of performance until these items can be competed in accordance with FAR 8.405-3.  As the identified required items are competed, the item will no longer be acquired under the LSJ; thus, bringing the MSPV-NG formulary in compliance with the competition requirements of FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements".

3.  Acquisition History:  VHA manages the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.  In 2013, the system consisted of 21 Veterans Integrated Services Networks with approximately 150 medical centers, 820 outpatient clinics, and various other facilities to include Community Living Centers, Veteran Centers and Domiciliaries.  Together, these health care facilities, and the more than 53,000 independent licensed health care practitioners who work within them, provide comprehensive care to about 9.3 million enrolled Veterans.  The MSPV Program is the primary means to obtain medical and surgical supply support for the VA healthcare system through contract support.  VHA, in cooperation with VA's National Acquisition Center (NAC), initiated contract support for the MSPV program in 2005.  The result was the first generation of seven prime vendor distributor contracts that not only support VHA, but also support the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of State, Indian Health Service, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Since that time, VHA and NAC have successfully executed two long-term, multiple-award 5-year contracts in support of the MSPV program.  In 2015, upon expiration of the second MSPV program, a set of bridge contracts were executed by the NAC extending the period of performance to April 19, 2016.  Those bridge contracts were as follows:  VA797N-15-C-0003, VA797N-15-C-0004, VA797N-15-C-0005, VA797N-15-C-0006, VA797N-15-C-0007, VA797N-15-C-0008, and VA797N-15-C-0009.  

In preparation for the continuation of the MSPV Program, the Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) assumed responsibility to award the new MSPV-NG contracts in 2014.  Due to a protest and continued technical evaluations, the SAC Contracting Officer determined that a second set of bridge contracts would be required to ensure continuity of services and the continuance of healthcare support throughout the VA community beyond the bridge contracts' expiration on April 19, 2016.  In February 2016, the SAC awarded the second set of bridge contracts.  They are as follows:  VA119-16-D-0007, VA119-16-D-0008, VA119-16-D-0009, VA119-16-D-0010, VA119-16-D-0011, VA119-16-D-0012, and VA119-16-D-0013.  The period of performance for the second SAC bridge contracts began April 20, 2016, and will expire no later than April 19, 2017.

Leveraging the NAC's lessons learned, VHA and SAC developed a procurement strategy for a complete VA-wide MSPV formulary of approved supplies by April 2016.  To execute this plan, VHA and SAC formed a team in February 2015, to initiate development of the MSPV-NG formulary.  The goal of this team was to solicit and award approximately 7,000 individual line-items, identified as an optimal initial level, for the pending MSPV-NG formulary.  The team developed a streamlined approach to solicit and award these items, which involved VHA providing salient characteristics for all 7,000 line-items, and SAC awarding competitive BPAs based on those salient characteristics.  

Between April 2015 and January 2016, VHA forwarded to SAC approximately 4,400 individual procurement packages consisting of both single and multiple line-items, of which approximately 3,500 were solicited and 900 returned to VHA for inclusion in future grouping efforts.  Although SAC issued multiple Requests for Quotations (RFQs), vendor response rates averaged less than 30 percent.  Due to lack of response, SAC and VHA sought input from industry via a series of MSPV-NG Industry Days.  When queried, industry partners indicated two main problems: (1) VHA's salient characteristics were flawed and/or insufficient.  They did not appear to be based on clinical input, and often cited unnecessary manufacturer-specific features.  This prohibited timely and quality responses, or no responses at all in many cases; (2) Industry also indicated the administrative burden of providing quotes for single-item BPA awards was not cost effective enough for them to provide quotes. 

In order to obtain a better success rate, and work on completing new MSPV-NG contracts, two possible strategies were identified:  (1) VHA created supply-line commodity teams, and began seeking clinical input for the development of salient characteristics.  Additionally, logical commodity groupings were developed; and (2) moving forward, VHA's Program Management Office was to group line-items by supply-line categories, or by United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes.  Supply-line categories were found to be the most favored by industry.  In an effort to validate this, a Request for Information (RFI) was issued to industry in February 2016.  The RFI results confirmed the supply-line category approach as the most appropriate method to solicit BPAs for item inclusion in the approved formulary.  

On February 24, 2016, awards were made to four MSPV-NG distributors, with an estimated performance starting 120 days after notice to proceed.  The period of performance under these contracts are scheduled to begin on August 20, 2016.  It was anticipated the distributors would have a full-line of 7,000 competitively awarded BPA formulary line-items to populate their electronic catalogs (e-catalog).  Due to lack of vendor response, the formulary fell short of the necessary items required to complete the Prime Vendor's e-catalog.  In an attempt to resolve the shortfall identified above, numerous changes in VA's strategy for populating the formulary were considered.  This directly resulted in the need to establish additional MSPV bridge distribution contracts to ensure continuation of service.  The MSPV bridge contracts were awarded with a start date of April 20, 2016.  This included a 3-month base period of performance, and three 3-month option periods.  The final period of performance expiration date is not-to-exceed 12 months.  

4.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The MSPV-NG formulary will consist of two tiers:  1) the 1,600 line items previously competed by the SAC and NAC, which is being automatically populated into the MSPV-NG formulary and estimated to be ready for use by October 20, 2016; and 2) the additional VA FSS items identified by VHA to be procured under this LSJ.  This group includes the Caviwipes and Cavicide distributed by Avkare. The full list of items covered under this LSJ is as follows:

The reprieve offered by this LSJ will allow VHA to continue placing orders under the MSPV-NG contracts on a temporary basis and avoid an interruption in the healthcare supply chain while SAC pursues competitive procurements for the MSPV-NG formulary items.  

The listed Caviwipews and Cavicide will be ordered under the authority of this LSJ.  These items have been identified as high-use medical items vital to the successful implementation of the MSPV-NG program.  VHA analyzed the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Medical Products Data Bank, focusing on the top high-volume purchases and identified 70 types of critical wraps and blood pressure cuffs distributed by Avkare.  
During the procurement phase, Avkare provided quotes for an additional 84 line items on their VA FSS which included the listed Caviwipes and Cavicide. The Contractor identified the additional items as "high use" frequently ordered items, commonly ordered in conjunction with the initially proposed items.  Based on the estimated annual quantities, the Contracting Officer determined that a BPA for Caviwipes and Cavicide are in the best interest of the Government.  This LSJ has been developed accordingly to account for the supply of the proposed line items. The Contractor was cautioned that the VHA Program Office and the Contracting Officer will determine the viability of all items for inclusion in the MSPV catalog.  All items quoted will be considered in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation.  

Until the MSPV-NG formulary is completed, VHA's ordering officers will be allowed to place orders for the required medical instruments and accessories.  The anticipated total value of the proposed BPA over the life of the agreement is $XXXXXXXX.  The period of performance is not to exceed 12 months.  

5.  Statutory Authority and Supporting Rationale:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), Urgent and Compelling. 

6.  Rationale Supporting the Authority Cited Above:  Urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect the interest of the Government will not permit competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)". Significant adverse consequences will occur if the LSJ is not approved as the VA health care supply chain will be negatively impacted. Continuance of the MSPV Distribution Program is vital; any delay of distribution will directly impair the delivery of healthcare and services to approximately 9.5 million Veterans currently receiving care through the VA Healthcare System. A break in the health care supply chain will hinder or halt the delivery of essential medical, surgical, dental, and laboratory supplies and other contracted medical/surgical, cleaning, rescue and safety supplies and services used in the direct delivery of patient care.  

The VA Healthcare System receives approximately 40% of its medical and surgical supply support through the national MSPV Program.  Many of these items are standardized throughout the VA Healthcare System, and are a part of the formulary being developed for use in the VA. The formulary drives efficiency and familiarity in clinical practice which leads to improved patient outcomes and safety. It also decreases variation, thus reducing time to train and results in less misunderstanding when providing care. Standardization provides healthcare system benefits that are maximized because standardized items are interoperable. Facilities can then reinvest the savings earned into equipment and personnel that further enhance patient care.

Estimated cost reduction for purchase of individual items through the MSPV formulary is approximately $4M over the course of the twelve months proposed under this LSJ. The $4M estimate does not account for efficiencies in the ordering and inventory management processes. Overall annual inventory reduction specifically attributable to MSPV is estimated at approximately $40M.  

Disapproval of the LSJ will result in a disruption in the health care supply chain and negate these potential savings as facilities source supplies through other means.  Workload, man-hours, and cost of operations will increase as already depleting resources are lost and the agency will revert to the inefficient means of sourcing medical supplies as before the introduction of the national MSPV program in 2005.  Those methods include use of purchase cards and local VHA contracting.  

Use of purchase cards as an ordering method has shown to be more than 5 times the workload burden of using the delivery order method under the MSPV program.  In addition, there are approximately 2000 contracting staff in VHA, processing 576,134 actions annually.  If the MSPV Ordering Officers were unable to place orders, and those transactions were added to the workload of an already overburdened contracting staff, the result would be catastrophic.  

Lead times through contracting for other than emergency orders are 45 days.  All orders would become emergencies.  Past examples of canceled surgeries due to lengthy supply lead times would become the norm, adversely affecting timely access to care.  Items critical to immediate care will be jeopardized, and will impact the life safety of Veterans.  

VA has a critical role in the comprehensive emergency response to support local, regional, or national emergencies or disasters.  VA is charged with the delivery and coordination of support missions for VA facilities affected by disasters, and also performs missions assigned to VA by FEMA or US Dept. of Health & Human Services for response to and recovery from nationally-declared emergencies and disasters.  The Prime Vendor Program is critical to ensure VA provides a full range of support to healthcare facilities to ensure resiliency, continuity and rapid recovery of healthcare services during disasters and other potential disruptions to healthcare service delivery.  VAMCs and other select Federal facilities are designated Federal Emergency Medical Facilities with significant contingency and emergency response roles.  Accordingly, the MSPVs provide emergency supply support during major catastrophic events.  Any interruption in the health care supply chain significantly jeopardizes the ability of VA to ensure minimum disruption to delivery of critical services in a contingency situation.

Other alternatives were considered, including utilization of both the legacy bridge contracts and the MSPV-NG contract concurrently while all of the supplies are competitively awarded.  The confusion this would create in the field is insurmountable.  A well coordinate supply chain is necessary to ensure facilities are supported, and Veterans are cared for timely.  There are no reasonable alternatives that would adequately address the circumstances presented. Any financial costs incurred by the Government to execute the BPAs under the authority of the LSJ and any potential costs or cost avoidance not realized through competition would not outweigh the benefits received through continuance of the health care supply chain. Approval of the LSJ is in the best interests of the Government and is justified by the urgency of the circumstances. 

The cost to the Government if the LSJ is not approved would not be primarily financial, although it is significant. The non-monetary costs of the health, welfare and safety of millions of Veterans cannot be quantified.  Every effort was made to compare these costs, benefits and other options; the VA cannot rationally find any other reasonable alternative.

VA considered the cost to the integrity of the procurement system and VA acknowledges the importance of protecting the integrity of the procurement system. However, VA feels this is an extraordinary situation and maintains that due to an already constricted schedule and the significant impact of these BPAs on the delivery of medical and surgical supplies and services to millions of Veterans, the facts of this case justify the unusual measure proposed under this LSJ.  VA considered the balance of the integrity of the procurement system and the interest of the Government and determined that the issuance of the BPAs under the authority of this LSJ is mitigated and justified.  A break in the health care supply chain will be costly and detrimentally disruptive to VA operations and delivery of critical healthcare services to 9.5 million Veterans.  

This action is vital to support VA's nationwide healthcare system and prevent disruptions to Veteran care.  The identified medical items represent supplies collectively determined essential by VHA medical centers to meet VA patient care needs.  Continued use of these products and source of supply will ensure timely delivery and minimize VA supply chain interruptions.  The vendor for these items was selected through use of data analytics tools and the Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB).  

The MSPV-NG program is the primary means to obtain medical supplies; these items are regarded as critical to patient care.  These items are currently available under the legacy MSPV contracts.  Failure to make them available under MSPV-NG would have catastrophic effects on the field's ability to support medical centers.  Each item would have to be purchased individually either via purchase card, or through local VHA Contracting Offices, with lead times of up to 45 days.  VHA Logistics and Contracting do not have the capacity to meet the constant throughput of high cost/high volume daily individual orders required to meet clinical care needs.  Bottlenecks resulting from capacity issues would result in insufficient inventory to meet critical needs for Veteran patients, and will have a significant patient safety impact.  It is imperative that VA transition from the present way of doing business under the current MSPV program to the new and revised mandatory MSPV-NG program.  In executing this change the following improvements will be realized:

a.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not ship any medical/surgical or any other supplies that are not on the Government-provided MSPV-NG formulary of approved medical/surgical supplies.
b.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not charge any VA formulary approved suppliers to handle their product in conjunction with the contract.
c.	The Government mandates all distributors to be Electronic Data Interchange compliant and it is in the BPAs/contracts. 
d.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not require product suppliers to carry liability insurance in excess of $1,000,000, charge tracking fees, and/or require additional discounts from product suppliers.
 
7.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  MSPV-NG distribution contracts were awarded on February 24, 2016, and performance is scheduled to begin in October 2016.  The MSPV-NG distributors require VA's formulary in order to fulfill the medical requirements at VA hospitals and clinics.  As stated previously, the Government intends to compete all line items within the next 12 months.  Market research shows there is adequate competition in support of the new requirements.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2), these actions will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO).  

8.  Determination of Best Value:  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d), the prices for supplies offered on FSS have already been determined to be fair and reasonable by NAC Contracting Officers.  Given VHA's critical need for the previously identified formulary supplies, and the short turn-around time until the MSPV-NG formulary is fully implemented, VA intends to select the lowest published FSS vendor and seek additional discounts.  To compete these items would result in unacceptable delays, and potential mission failure.  In the future, additional discounts will be sought through competition for these products as part of the transition to the MSPV-NG formulary.  

9.  Market Research:  The market research conducted for the MSPV-NG requirement showed there are multiple suppliers capable of providing medical products however; performance is required by October 2016, and VA does not have adequate resources for timely completion of the required items. VA has a need to have consistent, uninterrupted sources of supply that meets system-wide requirements without compromising direct patient care to VA medical centers and/or related facilities.  VA has a plan to compete these items and market research supports this acquisition strategy.  

10.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:  SAC is currently establishing competitive single-award BPAs that are beginning to populate the MSPV-NG formulary.  Competition is on-going; however, at the onset of MSPV-NG's period of performance, the formulary will not have sufficient breadth of medical products to meet the operational needs of VA.  It is anticipated the MSPV-NG distributors will begin accepting and delivering orders in October 2016 for all items covered in this LSJ. 

11. Actions to Increase Competition:  As described above, VA will compete future requirements and continuously add necessary products to the MSPV-NG formulary.  SAC will work with VHA's program office to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions.  VA has and will continue to meet with industry on a periodic basis for continued input and feedback on acquisition strategies.  All future acquisitions of MSPV-NG BPAs will be solicited and awarded in a manner that promotes competition to greatest extent practicable.

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for medical equipment and accessories, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6, "Limited Sources." The required items are supplied by Medline Industries, Inc., located at One Medline Place Mundelein, IL 60060. These items will be procured via the VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) V797P-4444B to populate the MSPV-NG formulary with mandatory health care supplies.  The MSPV-NG formulary is a list of approved healthcare commodities including medical, surgical, dental, laboratory, facilities/cleaning products, and textiles.  This LSJ will supply the MSPV-NG formulary with medical equipment and accessories distributed by Medline Industries on a not-to-exceed 12-month period of performance until these items can be competed in accordance with FAR 8.405-3.  As the identified required items are competed, they will no longer be acquired under the LSJ; thus, bringing the MSPV-NG formulary in compliance with the FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements".

3.  Acquisition History:  VHA manages the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.  In 2013, the system consisted of 21 Veterans Integrated Services Networks with approximately 150 medical centers, 820 outpatient clinics, and various other facilities to include Community Living Centers, Veteran Centers and Domiciliaries.  Together, these health care facilities, and the more than 53,000 independent licensed health care practitioners who work within them, provide comprehensive care to about 9.3 million enrolled Veterans.  The MSPV Program is the primary means to obtain medical and surgical supply support for the VA healthcare system through contract support.  VHA, in cooperation with VA's National Acquisition Center (NAC), initiated contract support for the MSPV program in 2005.  The result was the first generation of seven prime vendor distributor contracts that not only support VHA, but also support the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of State, Indian Health Service, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Since that time, VHA and NAC have successfully executed two long-term, multiple-award 5-year contracts in support of the MSPV program.  In 2015, upon expiration of the second MSPV program, a set of bridge contracts were executed by the NAC extending the period of performance to April 19, 2016.  Those bridge contracts were as follows:  VA797N-15-C-0003, VA797N-15-C-0004, VA797N-15-C-0005, VA797N-15-C-0006, VA797N-15-C-0007, VA797N-15-C-0008, and VA797N-15-C-0009.  

In preparation for the continuation of the MSPV Program, the Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) assumed responsibility to award the new MSPV-NG contracts in 2014.  Due to a protest and continued technical evaluations, the SAC Contracting Officer determined that a second set of bridge contracts would be required to ensure continuity of services and the continuance of healthcare support throughout the VA community beyond the bridge contracts' expiration on April 19, 2016.  In February 2016, SAC awarded the second set of bridge contracts.  They are as follows:  VA119-16-D-0007, VA119-16-D-0008, VA119-16-D-0009, VA119-16-D-0010, VA119-16-D-0011, VA119-16-D-0012, and VA119-16-D-0013.  The period of performance for the second SAC bridge contracts began April 20, 2016, and will expire no later than April 19, 2017.

Leveraging the NAC's lessons learned, VHA and SAC developed a procurement strategy for a complete VA-wide MSPV formulary of approved supplies by April 2016.  To execute this plan, VHA and SAC formed a team in February 2015, to initiate development of the MSPV-NG formulary.  The goal of this team was to solicit and award approximately 7,000 individual line-items, identified as an optimal initial level, for the pending MSPV-NG formulary.  The team developed a streamlined approach to solicit and award these items, which involved VHA providing salient characteristics for all 7,000 line-items, and SAC awarding competitive BPAs based on those salient characteristics.  

Between April 2015 and January 2016, VHA forwarded to SAC approximately 4,400 individual procurement packages consisting of both single and multiple line-items, of which approximately 3,500 were solicited and 900 returned to VHA for inclusion in future grouping efforts.  Although SAC issued multiple Requests for Quotations (RFQs), vendor response rates averaged less than 30 percent.  Due to lack of response, SAC and VHA sought input from industry via a series of MSPV-NG Industry Days.  When queried, industry partners indicated two main problems: (1) VHA's salient characteristics were flawed and/or insufficient.  They did not appear to be based on clinical input, and often cited unnecessary manufacturer-specific features.  This prohibited timely and quality responses, or no responses at all in many cases; (2) Industry also indicated the administrative burden of providing quotes for single-item BPA awards was not cost effective enough for them to provide quotes. 

In order to obtain a better success rate, and work on completing new MSPV-NG contracts, two possible strategies were identified:  (1) VHA created supply-line commodity teams, and began seeking clinical input for the development of salient characteristics.  Additionally, logical commodity groupings were developed; and (2) moving forward, VHA's Program Management Office was to group line-items by supply-line categories, or by United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes.  Supply-line categories were found to be the most favored by industry.  In an effort to validate this, a Request for Information (RFI) was issued to industry in February 2016.  The RFI results confirmed the supply-line category approach as the most appropriate method to solicit BPAs for item inclusion in the approved formulary.  

On February 24, 2016, awards were made to four MSPV-NG distributors, with an estimated performance starting 120 days after notice to proceed.  The period of performance under these contracts are scheduled to begin October 2016.  It was anticipated the distributors would have a full-line of 7,000 competitively awarded BPA formulary line-items to populate their electronic catalogs (e-catalog).  Due to lack of vendor response, the formulary fell short of the necessary items required to complete the Prime Vendor's e-catalog.  In an attempt to resolve the shortfall identified above, numerous changes in VA's strategy for populating the formulary were considered.  This directly resulted in the need to establish additional MSPV bridge distribution contracts to ensure continuation of service.  The MSPV bridge contracts were awarded with a start date of April 20, 2016.  This included a 3-month base period of performance, and three 3-month option periods.  The final period of performance expiration date is not-to-exceed 12 months.  

4.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The MSPV-NG formulary will consist of two tiers:  1) the 1,600 line items previously competed by the SAC and NAC, which is being automatically populated into the MSPV-NG formulary and estimated to be ready for use by October 2016; and 2) the additional VA FSS items identified by VHA to be procured under this LSJ.  The full list of items covered under this LSJ is as listed in Attachment A - Table 1.

The reprieve offered by this LSJ will allow VHA to continue placing orders under the MSPV-NG contracts on a temporary basis, and avoid an interruption in the healthcare supply chain while SAC pursues competitive procurements for the MSPV-NG formulary items.  

The proposed fifty-nine (59) types of medical supplies and accessories will be ordered under the authority of this LSJ.  These items have been identified as high-use medical items vital to the successful implementation of the MSPV-NG program.  VHA analyzed fiscal year (FY) 2015 in the Medical Products Data Bank. Focusing on the top high-volume purchases, VHA identified fifty-nine (59) types of critically needed medical supplies and accessories distributed by Medline Industries.  During the procurement phase, Medline provided quotes for an additional 844 line items on their VA FSS. The Contractor identified the additional items as "high use" frequently ordered items, commonly ordered in conjunction with the initially proposed items.  However, 438 of the additional items proposed had zero estimated annual quantities.  The Contracting Officer determined that the inclusion of these 438 items is not in the best interest of the Government; therefore, these items were eliminated from further consideration.  This LSJ has been updated accordingly to account for the increase in proposed line items. The Contractor was cautioned that the VHA Program Office and the Contracting Officer will determine the viability of all items for inclusion in the MSPV catalog.  If accepted, all items will be considered in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation for inclusion in the proposed BPA.  

Until the MSPV-NG formulary is completed, VHA's ordering officers will be allowed to place orders for the required medical equipment and accessories.  Initially, the anticipated total value of the proposed BPA over the life of the agreement was $XXXXXXXXXX. However, the inclusion of the additional items has increased the anticipated total value to $XXXXXXXXXXXX.  The period of performance is not to exceed 12 months.  

5.  Statutory Authority and Supporting Rationale:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), an urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

6.  Rationale Supporting the Authority Cited Above:  Urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect the interest of the Government will not permit competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)". Significant adverse consequences will occur if the LSJ is not approved as the VA health care supply chain will be negatively impacted. Continuance of the MSPV Distribution Program is vital; any delay of distribution will directly impair the delivery of healthcare and services to approximately 9.5 million Veterans currently receiving care through the VA Healthcare System. A break in the health care supply chain will hinder or halt the delivery of essential medical, surgical, dental, and laboratory supplies and other contracted medical/surgical, cleaning, rescue and safety supplies and services used in the direct delivery of patient care.  

The VA Healthcare System receives approximately 40% of its medical and surgical supply support through the national MSPV Program.  Many of these items are standardized throughout the VA Healthcare System, and are a part of the formulary being developed for use in the VA. The formulary drives efficiency and familiarity in clinical practice which leads to improved patient outcomes and safety. It also decreases variation, thus reducing time to train and results in fewer errors when providing care. Standardization provides healthcare system benefits that are maximized because standardized items are interoperable. Facilities can then reinvest the savings earned into equipment and personnel that further enhance patient care.

Estimated cost reduction for purchase of individual items through the MSPV formulary is approximately $4M over the course of the twelve months proposed under this LSJ. The $4M estimate does not account for efficiencies in the ordering and inventory management processes. Overall annual inventory reduction specifically attributable to MSPV is estimated at approximately $40M.  

Disapproval of the LSJ will result in a disruption in the health care supply chain and negate these potential savings as facilities source supplies through other means.  Workload, man-hours, and cost of operations will increase as already depleting resources are lost and the agency will revert to the inefficient means of sourcing medical supplies as before the introduction of the national MSPV program in 2005.  Those inefficient methods include use of purchase cards and local VHA contracting.  

Use of purchase cards as an ordering method has shown to be more than 5 times the workload burden of using the delivery order method under the MSPV program.  In addition, there are approximately 2000 contracting staff in VHA, processing 576,134 formal contracting actions annually.  If the MSPV Ordering Officers were unable to place orders via MSPV, and those transactions were added to the workload of an already overburdened contracting staff, the result would be catastrophic.  

Lead times to procure these items through contracting for other than emergency orders are 45 days; emergency orders require action within three days.  All orders would become emergencies to ensure timely delivery of healthcare to Veterans.  Past examples of canceled surgeries due to lengthy supply lead times would possibly become the norm, and thus, adversely affecting timely access to care.  Items critical to provide immediate care will be jeopardized, and will directly impact the safety and lives of Veterans.  

VA has a critical role in the comprehensive emergency response to support local, regional, or national emergencies or disasters.  VA is charged with the delivery and coordination of support missions for VA facilities affected by disasters, and also performs missions assigned to VA by FEMA or US Dept. of Health & Human Services for response to and recovery from nationally-declared emergencies and disasters.  The Prime Vendor Program is critical to ensure VA provides a full range of support to healthcare facilities to ensure resiliency, continuity and rapid recovery of healthcare services during disasters and other potential disruptions to healthcare service delivery.  VAMCs and other select Federal facilities are designated Federal Emergency Medical Facilities with significant contingency and emergency response roles.  Accordingly, the MSPVs provide emergency supply support during major catastrophic events.  Any interruption in the health care supply chain significantly jeopardizes the ability of VA to ensure minimum disruption to delivery of critical services in a contingency situation. This would directly impact healthcare delivery to our nation's Veterans.

Other alternatives were considered, including using both the legacy bridge contracts, and the MSPV-NG contract concurrently until all of the required items can be competitively awarded.  The confusion this would create in the field is insurmountable, as field staff will face the uncertainty of which contracts to use and when.   A well-coordinated supply chain is necessary to ensure facilities are supported, and Veterans are cared for timely.  There are no reasonable alternatives that would adequately address the circumstances presented. Any financial costs incurred by the Government to execute the BPAs under the authority of the LSJ, and any potential costs or cost avoidance not realized through competition would not outweigh the benefits received through continuance of the health care supply chain. Approval of the LSJ is in the best interests of the Government and is justified by the urgency of the circumstances. 

The cost to the Government if the LSJ is not approved would not be primarily financial, although it is significant. The non-monetary costs of the health, welfare and safety of millions of Veterans cannot be quantified.  Every effort was made to compare these costs, benefits and other options; the VA cannot rationally find any other reasonable or timely alternative.

VA considered the cost to the integrity of the procurement system and VA acknowledges the importance of protecting the integrity of the procurement system. However, VA feels this is an extraordinary situation, and maintains that due to an already constricted schedule, and the significant impact of these BPAs on the delivery of medical and surgical supplies and services to millions of Veterans, the facts of this case justify the unusual measure proposed under this LSJ.  VA considered the balance of the integrity of the procurement system, and the interest of the Government and determined that the issuance of the BPAs under the authority of this LSJ is mitigated and justified.  A break in the health care supply chain will be costly and detrimentally disruptive to VA operations and delivery of critical healthcare services to 9.5 million Veterans. Items procured under the authority of this LSJ will be included in the MSPV supply chain for a maximum period of twelve months until the item can be competitively awarded.  At such time the item will be removed from the supply chain and replaced with the competitively awarded functional equivalent.

This action is vital to support VA's nationwide healthcare system and prevent disruptions to Veteran care.  The identified medical items represent supplies collectively determined essential by VHA medical centers to meet VA patient care needs.  Continued use of these products and source of supply will ensure timely delivery and minimize VA supply chain interruptions.  The vendor for these items was selected through use of data analytics tools and the Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB).  

The MSPV-NG program is the primary means to obtain medical supplies; these items are regarded as critical to patient care.  These items are currently available under the legacy MSPV contracts.  Failure to make them available under MSPV-NG would have catastrophic effects on the field's ability to support medical centers.

Bottlenecks resulting from capacity issues would result in insufficient inventory to meet critical needs for Veteran patients, and will have a significant patient safety impact.  It is imperative that VA transition from the present way of doing business under the current MSPV program to the new and revised mandatory MSPV-NG program.  In executing this change the following improvements will be realized:

a.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not ship any medical/surgical or any other supplies that are not on the Government-provided MSPV-NG formulary of approved medical/surgical supplies.
b.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not charge any VA formulary approved suppliers to handle their product in conjunction with the contract.
c.	The Government mandates all distributors to be Electronic Data Interchange compliant and it is in the BPAs/contracts. 
d.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not require product suppliers to carry liability insurance in excess of $1,000,000, charge tracking fees, and/or require additional discounts from product suppliers.
 
7.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  MSPV-NG distribution contracts were awarded on February 24, 2016, and performance is scheduled to begin October 2016.  The MSPV-NG distributors require VA's formulary in order to fulfill the medical requirements at VA hospitals and clinics.  As stated previously, the Government intends to compete all line items within the next 12 months.  Market research shows there is adequate competition in support of the new requirements.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2), these actions will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO).  

8.  Determination of Best Value:  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d), the prices for supplies offered on FSS have already been determined to be fair and reasonable by NAC Contracting Officers.  Given VHA's critical need for the previously identified formulary supplies, and the short turn-around time until the MSPV-NG formulary is fully implemented, VA intends to select the lowest published FSS vendor and seek additional discounts.  To compete these items would result in unacceptable delays, and potential mission failure.  In the future, additional discounts will be sought through competition for these products as part of the transition to the MSPV-NG formulary.  

9.  Market Research:  The market research conducted for the MSPV-NG requirement showed there are multiple suppliers capable of providing medical products however; performance is required by October 2016, and VA does not have adequate resources for timely completion of the required items. VA has a need to have consistent, uninterrupted sources of supply that meets system-wide requirements without compromising direct patient care to VA medical centers and/or related facilities.  VA has a plan to compete these items and market research supports this acquisition strategy.  

10.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:  SAC is currently establishing competitive single-award BPAs that are beginning to populate the MSPV-NG formulary.  Competition is on-going; however, at the onset of MSPV-NG's period of performance, the formulary will not have sufficient breadth of medical products to meet the operational needs of VA.  It is anticipated the MSPV-NG distributors will begin accepting and delivering orders during October 2016, for all items covered in this LSJ. 

11. Actions to Increase Competition:  As described above, VA will compete future requirements and continuously add necessary products to the MSPV-NG formulary.  SAC will work with VHA's program office to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions.  VA has and will continue to meet with industry on a periodic basis for continued input and feedback on acquisition strategies.  All future acquisitions of MSPV-NG BPAs will be solicited and awarded in a manner that promotes competition to greatest extent practicable.
