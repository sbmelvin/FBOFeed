<DESC>This is a Request for Comment from industries, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, NASA centers, and other Government agencies.  NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) by NASA's Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) that establishes the guidelines and scope of proposal responses to mini-solicitations released under this BAA. This BAA will serve as the umbrella solicitation from which multiple solicitations will be made over the next five years for ESTO's Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) Prototyping System (APS).  The APS is a quick turn around, peer-reviewed solicitation process resulting in awards of $50,000 to $300,000 per year for a period of performance not to exceed 24 months. The APS process defines specific AIST needs for complementing existing technology investments and solicits ideas from the Earth and information science communities for filling those gaps.  In the Information Technology (IT) arena, the life cycle of a technology can be measured in months rather than years, necessitating a quick response system.  The APS process enables awards approximately three to four months after the release of an APS mini-solicitation under this BAA.  The AIST Program requires this flexibility to maintain a robust IT program for the Earth Science Enterprise (ESE). Participation is open to all categories of organizations, foreign (in accordance with NFS 1835.016-70) and domestic, including industry, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, NASA centers, and other Government agencies. The cut off date for questions/comments concerning this BAA is February 8, 2002.  Questions/comments may be addressed to NASA/GSFC, Attn: Kimberley Sweep/Code 215, Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, MD  20771. The BAA and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is    http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51     It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the BAA and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the BAA and amendments (if any).  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:    http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<DESC>The INEEL would like to team with a thermal spray company to develop the industrial design for spraying on the inside of pipes. Recent prototype work has led to the appropriate patent applications. The INEEL is interested in supporting the development of coating the inside of geothermal pipe on a large-scale basis.
At present, titanium and nickel alloy pipe are used in the geothermal industry to meet the operational requirements.  The DOE Geothermal Program is investigating the use of thermal spray coatings on carbon steel as a substitute for alloy pipe.
The INEEL would be interested in developing the fabrication specification and operational requirements for an internal pipe spraying system for the purposes of applying metallic corrosion resistant coatings.  
The spraying capability needs to be flexible so that a choice can be made between wire arc, plasma spray or HVOF mechanisms. The system must remotely apply several layers of coating evenly on the inside of a 10-inch ID pipe that is 80 ft long. This can be viewed as spraying from each end for 40 ft. The system must remotely perform surface preparation before coating and removal of particulate during the spray operation.
The coating must meet standard industrial quality requirements for consistency and durability. The system must be able to operate in a field environment such as at a pipe mill in a timely fashion as to not impact operations. This is approximately 30 minutes for each 80 ft pipe length.
Interested companies that can demonstrate the capital resources for field application should contact Karen Moore, INEEL, PO Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415   (208) 526-8852, E-Mail: gia@inel.gov or David R. Anderson PO Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415, (208) 526-0837, E-Mail: andedr2@inel.gov.

Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>NA Scope of Services required:  Design services to prepare the design-build RFP for a whole barracks complex for Wheeler-Sack Army Airfield (WSAAF).  The project is split into phases.  Phase 1 is in the FY04 program and currently approved for A/E selection. The additional phase(s) have not yet been approved for A/E selection, but Phase 2 is programmed for FY05.  It is the intent of the Government to award one A/E Contract for all Barracks Projects at Wheeler-Sack Army Airfield.  Phase 1 will be the basic cont ract and all additional phases, when authorized, will be modifications to the basic contract.Phase 1 includes one junior enlisted barracks (238 PN and 270 rooms, approx. 100,000 GSF) with soldier community facilities, one brigade headquarters (approx. 15,0 00 GSF), two battalion headquarters (each approx. 19,000 GSF), a dinning facility (approx. 16,500 GSF) and three company operating facilities (COF) (each of which are approx. 10,000 GSF).  Barracks includes living/sleeping rooms, semi-private baths, walk-i n closets and service area.  The soldier community facilities include day room, bulk storage, activity rooms, etc, per the standard design.  Install an intrusion detection system (IDS) in the company operating facilities.  Supporting facilities include ele ctric service, water, sewer, telephone, cable TV, security and street lighting, fire protection and alarm systems, paving walks, storm drainage, information systems, and site improvements.  Environmental landfill issues provide gas monitoring of a nearby c losed landfill.  Site improvements include filling a sand borrow pit, removing WWII concrete range wall, and removal of buried tires, mattresses and other unknown debris.  Access for the handicapped will be provided in the headquarters buildings, into the first floor administrative area of the COF?s and the soldier community facilities.  Provide comprehensive building and furnishings related interior design services.  Air Conditioning: 590 tons.Possible additional phase(s) are a continuation of the airfield  master plan barracks complex.  Additional phase(s) include a three story 240 room unaccompanied enlisted personnel housing (UEPH) (approx. 88,000 GSF) facility with a built-in soldier community building (SCB), a multi-purpose ball field, one Battalion hea dquarters (approx. 19,000), ten Company Operating Facilities (COF) (ranging from approx. 6,500 to 10,000 GSF), and associated roadways, drives and parking.  Utilities (water sewer, electric and gas) will consist mainly of lateral connections to the Roadway s, or nearest service points.  The main utilities along new roadways or existing or programmed under an ongoing project.  In accordance with the new DA standards, junior enlisted barracks are authorized 34 GSM per PN, which includes soldier community areas .  Under new standard, space is taken from the SCB areas and allocated to the barracks rooms.  As a result, this provides additional living room space and meets the space criteria for E-5/6 personnel, justifying a single barrack room instead of two (under the old standard).  Therefore, the number of rooms equals the number of personnel.Technical capability required:  A/E services for the preparation of a design build RFP to include plans, specifications, analysis, reports, and cost estimates. AE services to  support the project during the design build phase.  Possible contaminated soil may be included. Topographic surveys and subsurface explorations will be included. The following specific abilities and disciplines are minimally required: Architectural, Civil , Electrical, Mechanical, Structural, Cost Estimating, Fire Protection Engineer,  Surveying, Geo-technical, Environmental specialists, and Certified Industrial Hygienist.  Firms must submit in their submission a plan for management of consultants, a plan f or successful quality control and how they will integrate all design disciplines.  Special Qualifications: Experience with the design of military

<SUBJECT>A--ANNOUNCEMENT OF INTENT CONCERNING THE NASA OFFICE OF SPACE SCIENCE PLANS FOR THE MAGNETOSPHERIC MULTISCALE (MMS) MISSION
<SOLNBR>10-00027
<RESPDATE>082402
<CONTACT>Dr. James  Spann, MMS Study Scientist, Phone (202) 358-0888, Fax (202) 358-3987, Email jspann@hq.nasa.gov
<DESC>Note that this announcement is identical in content to the previous announcement released in October 2001 with the exception of the plans for the first Announcement of Opportunity and the estimated schedule. The Sun-Earth Connection Division of the Office of Space Science (OSS), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), issues this Announcement of Intent (AOI) concerning its tentative plans for the solicitation and implementation of the Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission, which is a key, strategic mission in the Solar Terrestrial Probe program.  Note that this AOI is not a solicitation for the MMS science investigations, spacecraft, or launch vehicle. The current state of planning calls for NASA OSS to release two Announcements of Opportunity (AO's) that will solicit proposals for science investigations to accomplish the Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission.  This mission intends to investigate and answer the fundamental questions concerning the physics of reconnection, charged particle acceleration, and turbulence as outlined in the MMS Science & Technology Definition Team Report (available at  http://stp.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions/mms/mms.htm ).  The primary science objective of the MMS mission is to understand magnetic reconnection. Because of the need for the maximum congruence, compatibility, and simultaneity of the required data over a volume of space, the studies that have been conducted to date suggest that this mission must consist at a minimum of four identical spacecraft, each carrying identical science payloads.   Three options have been thoroughly considered for the first AO: (1) Mission Principal Investigator (PI) mode (all instruments + spacecraft + ground system), (2) Instrument Suite (all instruments), and (3) Individual Instruments. A focused science investigation is required for MMS.  This can best be satisfied by options 1 or 2, which would deliver a highly integrated science payload. NASA believes that option 2 provides greater potential for competition than option 1. Therefore, NASA intends to issue the first MMS AO soliciting an Instrument Suite Science Team (ISST) science investigation under the leadership of single PI.  This PI would provide identical science payloads that would cover all mission phases (A-E) and partner with NASA to build and operate the MMS mission.  Given the availability of multiple proposals of sufficient merit, NASA intends to select several science proposals to conduct preliminary studies (Phase A).  Down-selection would occur at the conclusion of Phase A to the best ISST proposal to participate in Phases B-E.  Upon the announcement of the selection of the ISST, NASA intends to release the second MMS AO that will solicit Interdisciplinary Science (IDS) investigations.  Pending the submission of a sufficient number of proposals of merit, four to six IDS investigators will be selected who will have equal and open access to all of the MMS science data and who will be expected to work synergistically and cooperatively with the ISST PI for the completion of specific science investigations, including any that may have similar objectives even though independently proposed.  The successful IDS investigators and the ISST investigation PI will together form the MMS Science Working Group that will participate with NASA for implementation and successful completion of this mission. The estimated schedule of these procurements is as follows: Release of Draft AO of the MMS ISST AO - 			March 2002 Release of Final ISST AO - 						May 2002 ISST Proposals due - 							August 2002 Selection of ISST proposal(s) and initiation of Phase A study -	November 2002  Conclusion of Phase A study and release of MMS IDS AO -	Fall 2003 Selection of MMS IDS investigations - 				Winter 2003 Launch of MMS spacecraft and initiate mission operations - 	2008 Comments or questions regarding this AOI may be directed as follows: By mail: Dr. Jim Spann MMS Study Scientist Code SS NASA Headquarters Washi

<DESC>Solicitation Number 232-02-0004 Online Health Promotion with Paper and Online Health Risk Appraisal Amendment Number 2: (a) The DATE and TIME for submission of responses to this combined synopsis/solicitation is UNCHANGED.  The closing date and time for responses  remains January 11, 2002 at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.  (b) This amendment transmits the following Industry Questions and Government Responses: Q1.  Are there 400 worksites (total) for this project?  A1.  FOH has 250 Health Centers which have numerous customer agencies.  See the answer to question number 2, below.  Q2. Are there 250 worksites with RNs and 150 without RNs?  A2.  FOH has approximately 250 Health Centers staffed primarily by RNs.  The RFQ is modified to read: Articles or Services to be Delivered and Delivery Times--HRA: Paper Version--Paper version must be compatible with on-line HRA.  Is desired for data to be merged with on-line HRA's from same agency.  Clients will fill out and give to FOH nurse who will batch the questionnaires and send once per week.  There are approximately 250 sites that participate in the program.  HRA: On-Line Version--The contractor must be able to facilitate the merging of the on-line data with the data from the paper HRA.  Data from all sources is desired to be summarized for FOH customer agency reporting.  (Delete the line that states, "This is projected to be fewer than 150 each year.") This sentence did not relate to this deliverable.  The next to the last row of the table is modified to read: Annual and as requested Aggregate Summary of HRA requests.  This must be able to be sorted or filtered by each of FOH's customer agencies (approximately 150) and by the location (250 admin code).  The total will be less than 400 unique reports.  These will preferably be available on-line for FOH to pick up when required but if they must be run by the potential contractor, then they would be due beginning in September and completed by the end of October each year.  A one-week turn around for special request reports is required.  Q3.  Will each worksite likely have a mix of employees most of whom complete the on-line HRA while others complete the paper-based HRA?  A3.  Yes.  Some of our agencies do not have internet connections for their employees.  Q4.  Will one aggregate report per worksite be run per year?  A4.  Yes.  One aggregate report per Health Center (250) plus an aggregate report for some of our customers agencies who may have employees at numerous Health Centers (150).  Q5.  Can the aggregate worksite reports be only in a PDF format, or must they also be provided in hard copy?  A5.  They can be posted on a website that FOH management could go to and print them out.  Hard copy is not mandated as long as the reports are available easily and timely.  Q6.  Given that marketing and promotion plan is to be developed with FOH, how will the implementation of the corresponding plan be funded (e.g., will a separate budget be developed and awarded [for graphic design, printing, etc.], will internal FOH resources be used, both, other strategy?  A6.  FOH plans to have the equivalent of one full-time staff person available to coordinate this program.  This coordinator will work with the successful contractor to work out the best marketing plan possible.  Most of the marketing will be focused on electronic marketing of pre-designed email messages and flyers that can be transmitted electronically.  Tickler emails and other informational campaigns related to the National Wellness Calendar, i.e., breast cancer month, etc., would be provided by the contractor to the coordinator who would then finalize and disseminate.  This is expected to be a part of the service provided by the contractor and not a separate line item to be funded.  If it is determined that paper materials or other items that would have a cost to them is required, FOH will handle these in-house or another procurement method would be utilized.  Q7.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Autonomous Operations (AO) Future Naval Capability (FNC) is soliciting proposals from industry, academic institutions, and other agencies for the development of affordable technology solutions and the validation of performance capabilities required for the future Gladiator Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (TUGV) program. 
The Gladiator is an unmanned, tele-operated/semi-autonomous, highly mobile ground vehicle system intended to provide the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Ground Combat Element (GCE) with a variety of mission capabilities that will allow the detection, location, and neutralization of threats while reducing its risk exposure.  Examples of these desired capabilities are:  reconnaissance, surveillance, and targeting acquisition (RSTA); direct fire; obstacle breaching; chemical/biological weapon detection; obscurant delivery; engineering reconnaissance; communication relay; and tactical deception.  The Gladiator system will consist of a base mobility platform known as a Mobile Base Unit (MBU) controlled by an Operator Control Unit (OCU) via a radio frequency (RF) link.  The MBU will have built-in RSTA equipment and will be capable of seamlessly accommodating different Mission Payload Modules (MPM's) according to current mission needs.  The Gladiator must be small and lightweight enough so that two vehicle systems can be transported in the cargo area of an M1123 High Mobility Multi Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV A2).  It must be simple and durable enough to withstand extreme environments and abuse.  A system weight of eight hundred (800) pounds, including payload and Operator Control Unit (OCU) has been established as a target.  To be effective, the Gladiator must be capable of traversing all types of terrain, including soft soils, hills, vertical obstacles, negative obstacles, and water obstacles.  The Gladiator is intended to operate in hostile areas that would normally pose substantial risk to Marines.  It may be the recipient of, and engage in, direct fire activities.  It must be capable of surviving threats that include small-arms (7.62 mm) fire at close range and anti-personnel mines and grenades.  Since the Gladiator will suffer attrition as a result of operating in high risk environments, system affordability is of paramount importance.  A target Average Unit Production Cost (AUPC) of the base system (MBU and OCU) is $150K.  A complete description of system performance goals can be referenced in the document Desired Operational Performance Characteristics for a Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle.

Concurrently satisfying the stated performance parameters in an affordable manner will be a challenge.  The Office of Naval Research intends to award up to four (4) simultaneous contracts in FY02 for the first of a two-phase process to help shape the definition of the future Gladiator and, with the contractor, verify whether or not the majority of the requirements can be simultaneously and cost-effectively achieved.  The Phase I efforts will involve the investigation, design, and development of unmanned ground vehicle technologies in the areas of command and control, mobility, modularity, system signature reduction, durability, and survivability, which are vital to achieving system performance goals.   A preliminary system design and performance specification shall be the primary products delivered to the Government at the end of this phase and shall form the basis for a down-select decision to qualify for the Phase II.  Phase I is anticipated to last ten (10) months.  The next phase of the program will continue to refine the preliminary designs, identify and build candidate technology solutions, test them individually and in concert with each other, and finally integrate them together into mobility platforms called Technology Demonstration Models (TDM's) for performance testing and demonstrations.  Phase II is anticipated to last fourteen (14) months.  The products of the ON

<DESC>This is a Request for Quotation.  The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State (INL) is seeking the services of an independent laboratory to determine the toxicity of the aerial glyphosate spray mixtures.  There are up to three spray mixtures requiring assessment and evaluation for the purpose of determining their overall toxicity rating and specific ratings in six categories:  acute eye toxicity, acute dermal toxicity, acute inhalation toxicity, skin irritation, eye irritation and skin sensitization.  These are the same six categories of tests (6-pack tests) identified under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and used by the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances, United States Environmental Protection Agency for use in the testing of pesticides and toxic substances for review under Federal regulations. 
  The 6-pack tests will be run initially on two aerial spray mixture formulations using glyphosate products: one formulation includes a mixture based on the glyphosate product MON 2139 and a second formulation on the glyphosate product Roundup SL.  It should be noted that in the near future INL would seek testing of a third spray mixture based on the glyphosate product Roundup Ultra.   The laboratory will conduct the toxicological testing in an expedient manner according to industry standards and test guidelines established in Series 870 Health Effects Test Guidelines published by the Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  
The testing laboratory will provide INL with its protocols for the 6-pack tests and with instructions for drawing aerial spray mixture samples from the mixing tanks at field sites; instructions will include procedures for the storage and transport of the spray mixture samples and the chain of custody requirements.  The protocol should be based on OPPTS standard testing guidelines with the understanding that INL wants to evaluate the human safety considerations of the spray mixture exactly as that mixture is used (i.e. the spray solution is mixed at forward operating locations by trained mixing personnel and not in a laboratory).  Provided that the laboratory does not require a lab representative to draw the spray mixture samples, INL will draw and transport the laboratory-specified quantity of each spray mixture to the laboratory location in the United States.  The laboratory will perform an initial analysis of the mixture to characterize the identity of this mixture.  This characterization will include tests to determine the components of the mixture and the purity and concentration of those components.  This initial test will be run in order to avoid extensive further testing on aberrant samples that are not representative of a properly mixed spray solution.
The laboratory will conduct the testing on the MON 2139 and Roundup SL based spray mixtures and deliver its report(s) to INL within the required period of six months.  The laboratory will provide the eye irritation results on all spray mixtures to INL upon completion of the 21-day testing periods; priority to be provided to the MON2139 based product.
	Interested offerors should submit a technical proposal and price quotation to INL/RM/MS, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C St NW,  SA-4, Washington, DC 20520, Attn:  Mary Pat Hayes-Crow.  Faxed proposals and quotes may be sent to 202-776-8775 or emailed to hayes-crowmp2@state.gov.  The closing date for receipt of quotations is 1600 hours ET, 18 January 2002.  Questions regarding this RFQ may be directed to Mary Pat Hayes-Crow, Contracting Officer at 202-776-8373. 

Below are the ingredients with quantities to produce 200 gallons of spray mixture:

<SUBJECT>Common Submarine Radio Room (CSRR)
<DESC>The fundemental basis for the Common Submarine Radio Room (CSRR) program is to modify the Ohio and Los Angeles submarine rooms to promote commonality with the Virginia and Seawolf submarine radio rooms.  This presupposes that technical data on the Virginia and Seawolf submarine radio rooms exists. Unfortunately, such technical data does not exist at the present time.  Without such technical data on CSRR technical requirements and interfaces, a CSRR solicitation is not practical without unacceptable technical and cost risk to the Navy and industry. SPAWAR has made a decision to pursue an in-house solution in the short term. An in-house solution can be pursued in the short term with less technical and cost risk since it does not require a complete CSRR technical data package. Once a complete, or near-complete, CSRR technical data package is obtained, SPAWAR will reevaluate the CSRR acquisition strategy for the purpose of potentially releasing a competitive solicitation package.  Any potential competitive solicitation would first be synopsized in the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central webpage.  Therefore, please review these web sites periodically for the purpose of finding information on a potential competitive CSRR solicitation. Sould you require additional information, please contact the Contracting Officer, Mark Lopez, at e-mail address lopezm@spawar.navy.mil or by telephone at (619)524-7168.
