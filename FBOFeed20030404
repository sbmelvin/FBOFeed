<DESC>East and Central Africa Global Competitiveness Hub (ECA Hub) activities form part of the U.S. Government's Trade for African Development and Enterprise (TRADE) Initiative.  The TRADE Initiative seeks to mobilize U.S. and African partners from the public and private sectors to support specific trade capacity building needs. Three regional Hubs have been established in Accra, Ghana; Gaborone, Botswana; and Nairobi, Kenya.  The Trade Hubs facilitate capacity building activities through linkages with African regional trade organizations and networks, in collaboration with U.S. and African educational and business networks, U.S. and African government agencies, and other donors.   

The TRADE Initiative has six themes, namely to:

"	Enhance the competitiveness of East and Central African (ECA) products and services;
"	Expand the role that trade can play in African poverty reduction strategies;
"	Promote U.S.- ECA business linkages;
"	Improve the delivery of public services supporting trade;
"	Strengthen ECA capacity for trade policy formulation and implementation; and
"	Strengthen the enabling environment for ECA businesses.

Based in Nairobi, the ECA Hub covers Burundi, Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo (Brazzaville), Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa), Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.
  
The contractor for the ECA Hub will be required to work with the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA), a principal partner to REDSO based in Lusaka, Zambia, and the Transit Transport Coordinating Authority of the Northern Corridor (TTCA) based in Mombasa, Kenya. Other partners will be engaged in as far as their activities promote COMESA agenda of creating a common market where goods, services and people move freely using standards adopted from the World Trade Organization. The ECA Hub will ensure that trade between Africa and the U.S is promoted under the African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA).  Promoting efficient customs facilitation will be important to ensure seamless movement of goods from one country to another. Enterprise capacity building and linkages for the export market will be another area of concern. The Northern Corridor from Mombasa to Democratic Republic of Congo) will act as a fast track model for all the activities the Hub will implement in the region. 
 
In summary, to achieve the objectives of the TRADE Initiative through the ECA Hub, USAID/REDSO is pursuing improvements in four key areas:
"	Building capacity for trade policy formulation and implementation with specific emphasis on the World Trade Organization and COMESA;
"	Promoting business development and market linkages under the African Growth and Opportunity Act;
"	Harmonizing customs and trade facilitation policies for the countries (Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo) covered under the Hub taking the Northern Corridor countries as the model;
"	Increasing efficiency and reducing the cost of trade related transportation on the Northern Corridor and creating an operating model for replication by other interested parties in other corridors.

The ECA Hub was opened in October 2002, and the first year of operations is being implemented under a one year, $1.5 million contract between USAID/REDSO and Chemonics International.  The work plan for the first year of the ECA Hub will be provided with the RFP. The soon to be issued RFP for the ECA Hub will require a firm to implement this activity from the second to the fifth year (four-year performance period) starting in late September 2003.

The RFP document will be posted to FBO approximately (15-19) days from this Synopsis posting. The Solicitation number will be RFP: 623-03-014. No additional notice will be given concerning the RFP Solicitation date of issuance/posting.  Once the RFP Solicitation is posted to http://www.fbo.gov/ website, this will allow you to view/download/print the document to prepare your submission, if your organization decides to submit a proposal.  The RFP Solicitation will also identify the government website(s) to view/download/print any forms which must be used by offerors submitting a proposal.  The Office issuing the RFP Solicitation will NOT mail forms or hard RFP copies out.   

The Cover Letter to the RFP Solicitation will advise that there will be approximately (15) calendar days from the RFP issuance date allowed for the electronic submission of questions about any Section of the RFP document.  Approximately week later, the USAID will post to http://www.fbo.gov/ answers to all questions by issuing an Amendment to the RFP Solicitation.  Questions submitted after (15) day period may be answered (and, possibly, another Amendment may need to be issued) however, extending the RFP's closing date is NOT considered.

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25’s leading edge slats.  Over the years the slats have been cannibalized and repaired several times.  Repaired slats do not meet the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM’s) critical profile and contour dimensions for fit to aircraft which contributes to excessive labor hours during installation.  History shows that a complete disassembly of HU-25 slats is necessary for thorough inspections, which commonly require outer skin replacement.  Slats are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking also provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, and item location.  In order to maintain better configuration control, the Coast Guard has assigned and labeled slats with unique Coast Guard part numbers reflecting complete slat assemblies (see ARSC Control Drawing 925-267).
2.0	OBJECTIVE

A.	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair/overhaul and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 slat assemblies.  Repaired/overhauled slats must meet the OEM’s critical profile and contour dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal trimming and adjustment during slat installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair/overhaul. 
	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair for leading edge slats.  First, a “baseline repair” would be required for slats that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage. This would require skin replacement and hardware.  Second, “overhauls” would be required for slats that also exhibit significant wear and/or internal corrosion.  The offeror shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a baseline skin replacement.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the offeror's technical and cost proposal.  Offeror’s may propose additional levels of service.

The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, non-serviceable slat storage, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul slats.
	The offeror’s responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work. 

Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center’s (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  
B.	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 
1.	Technical
a.	Provide detailed work specifications for slat baseline repair and overhaul
b.	Provide a written Performance Metrics plan
c.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard
d.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s critical profile and contour dimensions per the OEM drawings listed in paragraph 3.0.
e.	Provide separate price breakdowns for slat baseline repair and overhaul
	Note: The Coast Guard considers a baseline repair as replacement of slat skins and required hardware to make complete slat assemblies.  An overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes replacement of internal assemblies and costly cannibalized components (i.e. bearing and rail supports, internal structures, rails, movable rib assemblies, etc.)
2.	Past Performance  
a.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items
b.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.

Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.

Cost/price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical factors approach equal.

Encl:  (1) Detailed factors
 

DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical Management/Solution/Approach

The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Contractor’s solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of slat refurbishment (repair/overhaul).  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Contractor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical management/solution/approach includes:

(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.

(b)	A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.

(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

§	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.
§	Clear lines of communication between the Contractor’s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.
§	Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.

(d)	The Contractor’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance.  E.g., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications.
 

Factor 2:  Performance Measures and Metrics

The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:

(a)	Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,
(b)	Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness,
(c)	Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.

Factor 3:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractor’s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractor’s actual performance on repair/overhaul of similar or like items.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.

Factor 4:  Cost/Price

Each Contractor’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation of proposed price/cost

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.
(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractor’s proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor’s technical proposal.

This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United States Air Force to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement for providing an upgraded High-Speed Network for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) at locations throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).  The High-Speed Network (HSN) will provide a modern communications backbone for the RSAF’s Command, Control, Communications, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) System.  The major nodes of the networks will be the five Sector Command Center / Sector Operations Centers (SCC/SOCs), the Command Operations Center (COC), and the Base Operations Center (BOC).  Each sector contains a number of radar sites, and the SCC/SOC is the radar track processing center for its sector as well as a backup center for radar sites in other sectors.  The HSN will have access links reaching each of the radar sites and be the main communications backbone for disseminating radar track data.  The network is to provide a secure high-speed broadband wide-area Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network to support the increasing data networking requirements of the RSAF C4I System.  Increased demand on bandwidth to support current operations and projected new multimedia applications are beyond the capabilities of the current network and necessitate its upgrade.  The network will maintain compatibility with the existing RSAF C4I communications architecture.  It will utilize existing airbase-to-airbase fiber optic connections, existing Satellite Communications (SATCOM) terminals and leased Saudi Telecom Corporation (STC) links for connections beyond the reach of the current fiber facilities.  Links to locations within air bases will either be direct fiber optic connections or remote circuits utilizing currently available copper lines or point-to-point microwave.  The network will support 10/100/1000 Mb/s switched Local Area Network (LAN) overlays employing Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802p/Q Virtual LAN (VLAN) and Quality of Service (QoS) standards.  High-speed commercial encryption will be provided to secure communications over the HSN.  New Video Teleconferencing (VTC) equipment and upgrade of existing fiber optic and SATCOM terminals at locations identified in the System Requirements Document (SRD) will be part of this effort.  Also, procurement, installation and integration of C4I Intranet equipment specified in the SRD will be part of this effort.  RSAF C4I site designations and locations impacted by the HSN project are identified in the SRD. Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this synopsis.  The Government requests interested offerors submit one (1) copy of their capability response no later than 4:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on 18 April 2003, and should not exceed 5 one-sided, 8.5 X 11 inch pages, with the font no smaller than 10 point, to the following address (for first class or overnight mail):  ESC/ACK, Attn: Jerome McDonald, 50 Griffiss St., Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-1625.  Additional HSN information can be obtained from the Hanscom Electronic Resources Bulletin Board (HERBB) at http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil.  It should be noted that the SRD for this project will not be posted on HERBB.  Qualified companies, who provide responses to this Sources Sought, will be provided a copy of the SRD upon request to the Contracting Officer.  Please direct any questions on this announcement to Mr. Jerome McDonald, Contracting Officer, phone 781-271-3906, or electronic mail jerome.mcdonald@hanscom.af.mil. A High-Speed Network (HSN) Industry Day is planned for 30 April 2003 from 0900 – 1200 hours, and will be held at the MITRE Corporation Complex, 202 Burlington Rd., Bedford, MA.  Vendors can schedule private, 30-minute meetings after lunch on 30 April 2003 with personnel from ESC/ACS (please note that these private meetings may extend into 1 May 2003 depending upon the number of interested Vendors).  See HSN Industry Day Invitation and Agenda posted on HERBB for more information about the Industry Day.  Please note that Contractors must provide responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis and have experience working in Saudi Arabia or other Middle Eastern countries to become eligible to participate in the Industry Day.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome, NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with CAE Soft Corporation, Rockwall, TX to provide assistance to AFRL/SNRT by simulating realistic Space Based Radar (SBR) data and providing it to the government.  The contractor will provide services in the form of scientific computing in support of an in-house SBR algorithm development program.  The contractor will use an existing software tool, Radar Analysis Simulation Tool – Khoros based (RASTK), developed by the contractor, to produce simulated SBR 'like' pulse Doppler data cubes, full domain interference and clutter analytic covariance matrices and RASTK workspaces.  These workspaces will later be used by AFRL personnel in a version of RASTK called the Research Laboratory Space Time Adaptive Processing Tool (RLSTAP).  The contractor will generate data under various environmental conditions (homogeneous clutter, site specific clutter, dense target environments, barrage noise jamming).  The contractor will carry out some basic radar MTI analysis.  This analysis will verify the data and be used to document SBR system issues for the given scenario.  The data cube products and covariance matrices will be used by AFRL/SNRT staff and other contractors to stimulate adaptive signal processing algorithms for the purpose of evaluating their effectiveness with respect to mitigating clutter and detecting both AMTI and GMTI targets.  AFRL/SNRT will be able to determine the issues of performing AMTI/GMTI from space from a processing point of view.  The contractor is providing computing services only.  Items for delivery include MATLAB formatted radar data cubes, Matlab formatted clutter and interference analytic covariance matrices, RAST-K/RLSTAP workspaces, and reports detailing the data products and any analysis.  The contractor will provide above service for a period of twelve (12) months.  The contractor may be required to review and use classified material up to the SECRET level; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for, access to SECRET information.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Routine questions should be communicated directly to the Contract Specialist, Janet M. Olson at 315/330/4752, Fax 315/330/8081 or email at: janet.olson@rl.af.mil.  This procurement shall be awarded under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  Commercial requirement is 100% small business set-aside under NAICS code 541519, with a small business size standard of $21.0M .

<DESC>This is an announcement that the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution (the U.S. Institute) will be soliciting quotations from qualified professionals to analyze and interpret evaluation data for environmental collaborative problem-solving and conflict resolution (ECR) cases.  Part of the effort will involve aggregate quantitative and qualitative analysis of new evaluation data and part will involve comparing the results of the analysis with findings in the published ECR literature. The goal of this Hewlett-supported project is to identify the key ingredients of ECR success, and to communicate these findings within the ECR field to improve practice. 

The purpose of this announcement in advance of issuing a formal Request for Quotations (RFQ) is to provide interested individuals an opportunity to identify potential team members.  As noted below, three sets of professional competencies and perspectives are identified, and a two or three-member analysis and review team is anticipated.  Respondents are encouraged to submit as part of a self-assembled team, although the U.S. Institute may assemble a team from individual respondents or select individuals from different proposed teams. 

Background

The U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution is a federal program established by the U.S. Congress to assist parties in resolving environmental, natural resource, and public lands conflicts. The U.S. Institute serves as an impartial, non-partisan institution providing professional expertise, services, and resources to all parties involved in such disputes.  See www.ecr.gov for more information on the U.S. Institute.

In 1999, the U.S. Institute and the Policy Consensus Initiative (PCI) began an inquiry into the feasibility of developing program evaluation guidance for state and federal agencies that administer public policy and environmental conflict resolution programs. With funds from the Hewlett Foundation, PCI has extended the initial collaboration involving the U.S. Institute, the Massachusetts Office of Dispute Resolution and the Oregon Dispute Resolution Commission (ODRC) to additional states.  At the same time, the U.S. Institute has been working with federal agencies to enlist their cooperation and involvement.  The initial collaborative effort focused on developing a conceptual framework for evaluating ECR programs – a logic model of expected outcomes for each of the agency’s programs.  With respect to ECR cases, the logic model identifies necessary practice factors and a set of both process and agreement outcomes.  In addition, specific questionnaires were developed to collect data needed to measure the degree to which the practice factors were in place and the outcomes were achieved.  

The U.S. Institute and the ODRC have adopted and are using the same theory of practice model and essentially the same questionnaires to evaluate their cases.  In addition, the U.S. Institute is working with several other federal agencies to evaluate their ECR cases.  This collaborative effort will produce an initial combined database collected in a consistent manner for perhaps 30 - 40 cases.  Analyzing this aggregate database and interpreting the results should add substantively to the growing body of information from other ECR research and evaluation efforts.

Key Questions to be Addressed

Two overarching questions will be addressed through this ECR evaluation effort:

1.	What aspects of ECR best practices are most important for collaborative problem-solving and conflict resolution processes to be successful?
2.	Which practices need to be employed more effectively by ECR practitioners and program managers? 

Summary of the Anticipated Solicitation

It is anticipated that a two- or three-member analysis and review team will be assembled to perform the required tasks (one member may be qualified to perform more than one function and individuals may submit responses for more than one of the described team roles).  The team will reflect the following competencies:  
§	Statistical evaluation – a program evaluation expert who is familiar with evaluation in the ECR field, and possesses methodological expertise needed to design and interpret the results of aggregate analyses of case data, and possesses (or has access to) analytical skills needed to conduct such analyses;
§	The ECR research – a recognized expert in research on the effectiveness of ECR and public involvement activities, will be thoroughly familiar with the associated literature, and will be able to assess the rigor and generalizability of the findings of both the aggregate case analysis and of other empirical studies; and
§	The ECR practice – an experienced facilitator of collaborative planning and problem solving processes and/or a mediator of environmental disputes, who is a recognized leader in the field, and who has the expertise to assess the utility of the evaluation findings to ECR practice.

Individual statements of interest and quotations will be solicited from and individual contracts will be negotiated with each member of the analysis and review team.  The U.S. Institute also encourages interested candidates to identify and assemble a complete team and to submit a combined response. 

Funding and Scheduling

Funding for the analysis and review team is $ 40,000 plus travel costs, with funding levels for each of the team members to be determined based on negotiated scopes of work.  The work will be conducted from June 30 through November 30, 2003.  A team meeting will be held in Tucson in mid-September to discuss progress and preliminary results, and a meeting of approximately 30 ECR researchers, program managers from state and federal ECR programs, trainers, and practitioners will be held in Tucson in mid-November to review and discuss the team’s findings.

<CONTACT>DENIS S. THARP, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513 487-2092, E-Mail: Tharp.Scott@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory will procure On-Vehicle Portable Diesel Emissions Measurement Systems/Devices. EPA seeks to engage in widespread portable on-vehicle emissions measurement.  Recent compliance actions against vehicle and engine manufacturers have demonstrated that engine-powered vehicles can be configured to emit low emissions under EPA laboratory test conditions, yet under "real-world" operating conditions, the vehicles can emit higher than EPA limits.  EPA needs Portable Devices (PDs) to conduct compliance testing.  EPA plans to measure on-vehicle emissions for compliance purposes, diagnosis of emission problems and monitoring emission system retrofits during actual diesel vehicle operation.  EPA requires Portable Diesel On-Vehicle Emissions Measurement Systems/Devices capable of measuring on-vehicle gaseous and particulate emissions from the following source categories: (a) On-highway heavy, medium, and light-duty engines, (e.g. trucks and  buses) (b) Non-road engines (e.g. generators, construction, agricultural equipment, lawnmowers) (c) On-highway light-duty vehicles and trucks up to 14,000 GVW For a definition of diesel on-highway heavy, medium, and light-duty engines see  40 CFR ?86.090-2 (a). EPA has monitored several efforts to design and construct on-vehicle emissions measurement systems, and EPA has also completed similar tasks independently.  EPA would like to aid the emission measurement industry by helping develop a future commercial emission measurement system that works across various engine types.  Choice of emission instrumentation technology is generally up to the offeror.  EPA is currently using its own on-vehicle emission measurement system:  the Real-time On-road Vehicle Emissions Reporter (ROVER).  (EPA's ROVER patent #6,148,656, can be accessed at the United States Patent and Trademark office website: http://www.uspto.gov/main/patents.htm).  The goal of this acquisition is to award multiple contracts for the delivery of approximately two (2) to four (4) Portable Diesel Gaseous On-Vehicle Emissions Measurement Systems/Devices, but probably no more than one per contractor.  EPA is seeking to purchase PDs in production, or near commercial production.  Near commercial production is defined as being deliverable within 30 days of contract award.   Portable Diesel Gaseous Emissions Measurement System Minimum Capabilities -  Measure pollutants:  total oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), total hydrocarbons (THC), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), oxygen (O2), Fuel-air ratio (l)  -  Pollutant measurement methods are up to the contractor -  Measure exhaust flow rate, or equivalent -  Measure engine speed -  Record and display all emission levels in grams/sec or grams/mile or grams/hp-hr -  Record and display all acquired data at 1Hz or greater -  Record all data in time-aligned output data file at 1 Hz  -  Record computer or data acquisition system records results for later review and analysis -  Demonstrate that the PD system's results correlate well with standard fixed laboratory FTP system measurements Portable Diesel Particulate Emissions Measurement Device Minimum Capabilities -  Measure instantaneous and/or cumulative diesel particulate mass, with output in micrograms -  Particulate measurement method is up to the contractor -  Communicate data via RS232 or other output for collection by gaseous emission measurement systems' host computer or data logger -  Acquire and time-aligned all data at 1Hz or greater -  Demonstrate that the PPD system's results correlate well with standard fixed laboratory FTP diesel particulate system measurements BASE   One (1) Portable Diesel On-Vehicle Gaseous Emissions Measurement System per contract that independently quantifies vehicle exhaust emissions as specified in Section 3.1.1, including accessories to field-calibrate, operate, and  maintain the system. OPTION 1 Up to Two (2) Portable Diesel On-Vehicle Particulate Emissions Measurement Devices per contract that quantifies vehicle particulate exhaust emissions as specified in Section 3.2.1, including accessories to field-calibrate, operate, and  maintain the device. OPTION 2 Up to Two (2) Portable Diesel On-Vehicle Gaseous Emissions Measurement Systems per contract that independently quantifies vehicle exhaust emissions as specified in Section 3.1.1, including accessories to field-calibrate, operate, and  maintain the device.  Option 2 may be exercised up to two (2) years after contract award. * Note: For items in Option 2, EPA expects that these PDs will include any improvements or upgrades incorporated by the manufacturer after delivery of base items. The contractor shall also provide:  -  All users' manuals, including documentation of the procedures used to operate the system/device.  -  Training manuals  -  All maintenance documents, including the installation, calibration, operation, and maintenance procedures in a step-by-step format.   -  Standard Commercial Warranty. This procurement will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria and Full and Open Competition for everything in the SOW including Options.  The solicitation should be issued by April 21, 2003 on our website http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Experimental Therapeutics Branch (ETB), plans to enter into a sole source contract with NeuroDetective International, 1757 Wentz Road, Quakertown, PA 18951.  The ETB focus is on the understanding of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in the brain as it relates to Parkinson's and other neurologic and behavioral disorders.  One means of studying nigrostriatal dopaminergic is to identify key genes and therir protein products that regulate neurotransmission.  ETB has generated mice that lack a specific gene which are believed to play an important role in brain function.  In order for ETB to understand the true function of this critical brain molecule on motor function and behavior, 10 adult mice and 10 wild type control mice shall be tested extensively in a specialized facility using unique equipment which is located and used at NeuroDetective International  for the assessment/testing.  The assessment/testing shall include: appearance, posture, muscle tone, motor coordination, orientation to sensory stimulation (such as car reflex, eye blink) limb and vibrissae responsiveness, vocalizations, pupillary response, response to sound, grip strength, activity level (including circadian activity, open field testing), balance ability, rotating rod task, beam walking, Morris water maze performance, and context discrimination.  In addition, tests of axiety such as elevated plus-maze and light/dark preference testing and response of the animals to centrally active drugs as well as pre-pulse inhibition will provide essential information to NINDS research.  NeuroDetective International is the only source known to the government that can provide such testing with the experience required including the pharmacological agents needed to complete these studies.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation, however, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT on April 11, 2003.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This requirement will be procured as non-commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 13.  Please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent (301) 402-4509 if you have further questions.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code: 541380.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a wind farm project in Hungary.  This study will aid Greenergy Kft. in developing a scope of work for the engineering, procurement, and construction of the project.

Greenergy Kft., a private Hungarian development company, is presently conducting wind measurements in Hungary at eight locations and plans to develop multiple wind farms in Hungary.  This feasibility study will cover an additional eight locations. 

Expanding efforts already underway will allow the realization of several different wind-parks with a total capacity of 80 – 100 MW and an investment of $80 million to $100 million.  The final location of the wind farms will be determined based on the results of the feasibility study.

The feasibility study has been estimated by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to cost $242,207.  The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a USTDA grant of $138,000 and by the Grantee for the remaining costs required to complete the full Terms of Reference (TOR).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, May 2, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>RFQ 72135 Generators - Questions & Government Response received from = contractors. 1.     What is the fuel tank volume/gallon size of tank. Government Response: 550 gallons for the two generators. 2.     Will both generator sets be fed from the fuel tank at the same time.  Government Response: Yes! 3.     Are there any options on the fuel tank. Government Response: Must be double lined tank to meet environmental requir= ements.  Also, must have fuel gauge and/or site glass to indicate level  (v= olume/gallon) of fuel in the tank. 4.     What is the distance from generator sets to the fuel tank. Government Response: About twenty feet. 5.     Is an oil drain with extension to the outside of the frame rails acc= eptable in lieu of the sump pump mentioned in the RFQ. Government Response: No, the sump pump is and requested to expedite removal=  of oil from the diesel generator. 6.     Are the generators to be mounted indoors or outdoors. (outdoors requ= ires a weather enclosure) Government Response: Mounted indoors.  Pearl Harbor will construct enclosur= es for the two Diesel Engine Generators (DEGs). 7.     How quickly will the acceptance of the bid happen. Government Response: Within two weeks of receipt of quotes. 8.     What is the date of delivery. Government Response:  The vendor shall provide in stock delivery / or provi= de lead time of product. 9.     Is there any type of enclosure on the generators? Interpretation of = the specifications is that they are open skid units. Government Response: Yes, it is open skid units.  We will construct our own=  enclosures. 10.     "One UL 550 Gallon above ground fuel tank with fill capability and = access ladder" - Can the referenced tank be an integral type, base mounted = as part of the Generator set or does it need to be a "stand alone" type. Government Response: We have already designed our enclosures for a stand al= one type generator.  To have an integrated type generator set will require = us to redesign our lay down plan.  If the integrated type generator will ad= d height to the DEG set then, it will add height to the enclosure.  This ad= ded height might interfere with our crane operations. 11.     Is there one tank per set or one common tank for the two units.  Government Response: One common tank for two DEGs. 12.     Is the 2-page specification the only specification for this project= .  We are used to seeing a lot more detailed specs for generators/ATS for m= ilitary or government jobs therefore we would like to make sure that there'= s no other web-links to more detailed specifications or stringent MIL stand= ards. Government Response: Yes, the 2-page specification is the only specificatio= n for this project.=20 13.     Specification refers to the "delivery schedule" of the products, bu= t we have no indication of what the lead time requirements are or if there = are any.  Are there any lead time expectations. Government Response:  The vendor shall provide in stock delivery / or provi= de lead time of product. (Same as question #8) 14.     Specification refers to compliance with your terms and=20 conditions.  We only have technical specs and one reference to invoicing.  = We have not received any commercial or contractual terms and conditions - a= re they available or do we need to worry about it at this point.

Government response: Yes, the radiators are to be unit mounted. 17.     What is the voltage dip. Government response: The voltage dip is less than +/- =BD% (steady state) a= nd less than +/- 1% (no load to full load). 18.     What is the R/R rating (deg. C). Government response: We are not clear on this question but we assume the ve= ndor is asking about the radiator's temperature or the alternator temperatu= re rise.  Therefore, the Maximum Ambient Temperature of the Radiator is 56C= /133F or the Alternator Temperature Rise is 130C. 19.     How far away from the fuel cell will the generators be located. Government response: Approximately twenty (20) feet away.

<DESC>Answers to questions received in response to the subject announcement for 53-3615-3-02:

QUESTION #1: As I measure on our map, our company is very close to the 210 radius limit for consideration for this solicitation.  Is this factor strictly considered, barring us from all bidding activity?  ANSWER (1):We use the company's mailing address to determine the distance based on an internet web search Map (distance)  site on the internet.  If your company is not within the 210-mile radius, you will not be eligible for consideration.
QUESTION #2:The solicitation mentions that delivery orders will be issued for each individual project and will not exceed $100,00 per project.  Could you please tell me what a "delivery order" is and how it relates to a "project?"	ANSWER (2):A Delivery Order means an order for supplies placed against an established contract.  A Task Order means an order for services placed against an established contract. A Task Order (delivery order) will be issued for each project based on the initial contract requirements.   
QUESTION #3:If projects are broken up into phases, does the $100,000 maximum apply to the whole project, or to each phase?
ANSWER (3):The $100,000 maximum applies to the whole project regardless of phases. QUESTION #4: Please confirm Solicitation Number (53-3615-3-02) is listed as the Sol. Number, but the project number later in the solicitation is listed as             50-3615-3-02. ANSWER (4):The correct Solicitation Number is 53-3615-3-02.QUESTION #5: What firm currently holds this contract and where are they located?  What is the amount of work (in dollars) actually allocated to that firm under the contract?
ANSWER (5):Delta Engineers, PC, 164 Court Street, Binghamton, NY 13901 We have awarded approximately $500,000.00 in task orders to the current contractor annually. QUESTION #6: Is there currently more than one contractor with this contract? ANSWER (6):	No. QUESTION #7:Does the responding firm need to show a licensed environmental engineer? ANSWER (7):No QUESTION #8:Will the contract result in actual removal of asbestos or hazardous materials' abatement, or does the responding firm need only provide the design and planning procedures for these actions?
ANSWER (8): Design, planning, and monitoring will be required.
	QUESTION #9: 	Can you tell me if the solicitation is a recompete of a previous contract or if the current contractors are working at these sites performing the intended scope of work?
ANSWER (9):Yes.  Also, see questions #5 and #6.
QUESTION #10: 	Can you provide us with a list of firms that have traditionally worked with the USDA in order to contact them to inquire about joining their team as a sub-consultant for the term of  this contract? ANSWER (10):	No.
QUESTION #11: Will there be a single award under this solicitation? ANSWER (11):The Government reserves the right to award more than one contract for this requirement.
QUESTION #12:	Must A/E firms pursuing this opportunity be capable of providing all services listed? We do not perform random testing and asbestos abatement.  However, can we provide those services through use of a sub-consultant?
ANSWER (12): 	Yes.   Yes - Also see Question #8.
QUESTION #13:	In reviewing the solicitation request, we have a question regarding selection criteria (5) regarding the proximity of our office to the Ithaca and Geneva labs: Is there a maximum distance limit?	ANSWER (13): 	Yes - See Question #1 and see modified synopsis announcement which modified the requirement for evaluation criteria number 5.

<RESPDATE>042503
<ARCHDATE>06242003
<CONTACT>Robert Massaro, 732-532-2677
<DESC>NA This notice attempts to identify additional sources for a future competitively-solicited, firm-fixed price, IDIQ contract in support of the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio Systems (SINCGARS). A best-value, competitive acquisition is planned. The a warded contract will be a one-year, IDIQ type contract with four one-year options. The contract will also include a two-year Award Term Incentive that will allow the Government to extend the period of performance from five to seven years with the award of any future requirements subject to the availability of funds. The contractor shall provide Advanced System Improvement Program (ASIP) SINCGARS, associated ancillary equipment, spares for various legacy configurations, test sets, repair, engineering service s, and an exportable version of the ASIP radio. Spares are defined as Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs), replaceable subassemblies, and parts of end items that have National Stock Number (NSN) assignments and are listed on Append ix A of the Statement of Work (SOW). Support services include repair, repair and return, and other engineering/technical services that are needed to field and sustain SINCGARS equipment. Please Note: the SOW and the associated NSN assignments listed on App endix A of the SOW may be found on the Army's Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) at:  https://abop.monmouth.army.mil./ Select CECOM Comm. Elec. Comm; Select Solicitation Number: DAAB07-03-R-C205. All the essential information and documents rela ted to this solicitation may be found on the IBOP.   CECOM is revising the SOW, and the following are the areas that will be changed. These changes shall NOT BE SEPARATELY PRICED, and therefore are built into the unit price of each of the NSNs on contract. 1.  OBSOLESCENCE MANAGEMENT: Obsolescence will be transparent to CECOM. The effect of obsolescence and/or obsolescence issues will be the responsibililty of the contractor to control. The contractor shall be responsible for planning for obsolescence; initi ating minimum buys of parts, buyouts, requalifications of part substitutes, and any necessary redesigns, while maintaining the contracted delivery schedule and firm-fixed price of each item. During any redesign effort, modernization should be pursued to im prove performance and schedule, and reduce the Government's Total Ownership Cost. Several of CECOM's goals are (but not limited to): improvement in the reliability repairs, reduction in the number of components and spares, increase in the use of commonly a vailable commercial parts, and reduction in Production Lead Time. Any new designs shall be qualified, at a minimum, at the system level for compatibility with all equipment (including TMDE), and all configurations already fielded, and shall be the responsi bility of the contractor to ensure this hardware and software compatibility. The form, fit, and function of the equipment will be maintained. 2.  CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT: CECOM intends to release the configuration control of the SINCGARS technical data to the contractor. With the exception of INFOSEC related items, the contractor shall be responsible for all the changes and updates to the drawi ngs without requiring CECOM's approval. A CECOM representative, such as a QAR, COR, or other member deemed necessary, shall be provided copies of the approved internal Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) (or contractor change document) and updated (revised ) drawings as they are entered into the contractor's own drawing repository. At any time during the contract period, the technical baseline at the contractor's facility shall be the same as at CECOM's. The drawings provided at the time of award will servea s the initial technical baseline, or the starting point. The Government will provide drawing numbers for your configuration control. Updates to the Technical Data Package (TDP) will not have any proprietary designs introduced so that the TDP will remain co mpetitiv e. 3.  AWARD TERM INCENTIVE: A two-year award term incentive will be added to the contract. The basis of award for this term will be the performance of the contractor with regard to reliability improvements and power consumption improvement during the initial  five-year period of the contract. The contractor shall propose a Reliability Improvement Curve and Power Consumption Improvement Curve depicting their anticipated improvements that initially will serve as evaluation criteria. These curves shall then becom e a contractual obligation, and added to the base contract of the winning offeror. Meeting or exceeding the stated objectives of these two curves will form the basis for awarding the two-year contract term. These revisions are provided for the offeror's information and are subject to change. Feedback is welcomed by April 25, 2003. The final solicitation is expected to be released by mid May 2003 with an anticipated award date of November 2003. In the event that your firm has an interest in bidding this proposed solicitation, request that your response be forwarded to the lead Contra ct Specialist, Robert A. Massaro at (732) 532-2766. Your response should include at a minimum your company name, address, cage code, and a technical point of contact.

Provides individual and institutional fellowships to increase scientific expertise in neurological fields. Operates a program of contracts for the funding of research and research support efforts in selected areas of institute need. Conducts a diversified program of intramural and collaborative research in its own laboratories, branches, and clinics. Collects and disseminates research information related to neurological disorders.

NINDS has targeted Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) for a pilot program in accelerated therapeutics development. SMA is a devastating neurological disease of childhood for which no effective treatment is currently available. SMA causes degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem, leading to muscle weakness and, in severe forms of the disease, death. It is the most severe of the common genetic neurological diseases and is the leading heritable cause of infant death. SMA is an ideal candidate for targeted therapeutics development. It is caused by the loss of function of a known gene, SMN1. Thus, there are tractable strategies for developing treatments based on replacement of the lost function. Multiple therapeutic avenues are available, including drug development, gene therapy and stem cell therapy.

NINDS’ research goal for Spinal Muscular Atrophy is to efficiently translate a mechanistic understanding of SMA into a testable therapy suitable for clinical trials. The NINDS strategy for achieving its research goal is to fund parallel therapeutic pathways in a rapid milestone-driven process that will identify a promising therapeutic candidate. This project will require a high level of scientific expertise and experience on the part of the contractor. Furthermore, efficient progress will involve an unusual degree of acceleration and integration of multiple research projects, and thus success will also require that the contractor use creativity and flexibility in applying that scientific expertise. 

It is anticipated that one award may be made for a period of four years in September 2003.

<DESC>This is a modification to combined synopsis/solicitation number RS-ADM-03-161. 
The combined synopsis/solicitation number RS-ADM-03-161 is amended as set forth below.  NOTE: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY AMENDMENT TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.  A WRITTEN AMENDMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The hour and date specified for receipt of responses remains 4/18/03 at 3:00 p.m. local time.  Offers must acknowledge receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted or by separate letter or telegram which includes a reference to the combined synopsis/solicitation number and the amendment number 6.  The above numbered combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to respond to vendor questions.  Accordingly, ADM-03-161 is amended as follows:

(1)  Following are responses to questions: 

QUESTION #1:	You mentioned "scrambled" signal from NRC to contractor's site.  I assume this would be required if we were to take the feed by fiber to our facility and then webcast.  But, would we be able to install our webcasting computer in the rack at NRC, encode the signal there (hands off, remotely),and send it to our distribution network?  Would this strategy eliminate the need to scramble?
RESPONSE #1:	Refer to Task-3 in the SOW which states: "The Contractor shall capture the combined feed via the Contractor's connection to the NRC video-system at the NRC Headquarter's location in Rockville, Maryland, and:
			1.  encode the content to protect it from alteration and/or corruption;
	  		2.  transmit the content from the NRC Headquarter's location to the contractor's offsite webcasting infrastructure;
	  		3.  connect the content to the contractor's webcasting webpage;
	  		4.  provide free access to the "live" webcast content to all interested parties via the webcast webpage."
			Please propose solutions that meet these requirements.


QUESTION #2:	Will any titles or captions, other than the captioning mentioned, be required?
RESPONSE #2: 	The webcast vendor will not be required to perform any captioning.  NRC will obtain the services to caption the meeting's discussions in real-time and NRC will then add the captions to the single composite video feed, prior to delivering the feed to the webcast vendor.  Refer to Task-3 in the SOW which states: "For those meetings that NRC elects to webcast "live" (while the actual meeting is taking place), NRC will video-tape the meeting's events, add closed-captioned text of the meeting's discussions to "line-21" of the meeting's video image and create a combined feed of the meeting's content (video/audio & closed-caption text)." 


QUESTION #3:	Your AV technician indicated that the archival video version would not require captioning.  Will tapes sent to contractor require captioning?  If so, will the captioning signal be part of the video or will contractor have to add?
RESPONSE #3:		Refer to the response to the previous question (#2).  The webcast vendor will not be required to perform any captioning.  NRC will add captioning to the composite video feed of "Live" webcasts, prior to delivering it to the webcast vendor.  If any captioning is desired by NRC for a taped meeting, NRC will add it to the video on the tape, before providing the tape to the webcast vendor.  

QUESTION #4:	Your specifications in the synopsis mentioned " equivalent quality of video image as the RealNetworks software".  Is RealNetworks software a requirement, or can we utilize Windows Media software which is considered by industry experts to be the equal to Real Networks in quality?  Should we offer a choice, or option, in our pricing proposal?
RESPONSE #4: 	We have decided to modify the current SOW under Task-1, requirement #4 which states: 
			"4. Provide all webcast viewers with "free" (no cost to the viewer) software for download to their computer, which enables them to monitor the NRC meetings being webcast.  The viewing software shall provide the viewer with an equivalent quality of video image and sound as the "RealNetworks" software currently used for the NRC's webcasting program.   The Contractor shall ensure that all required licensing arrangements are completed in order to make the equivalent software available for free download by NRC webcast viewers from the contractor's webcast website." 
			This current language for #4 is hereby deleted and replaced with the following new language:
			"4.  Provide all webcast viewers with the capability of choosing to view NRC webcasts in two (2) software formats, one of which shall be RealNetworks.  The second media player software format is up to the webcast vendor, but both software formats shall comply with all of the SOW requirements.  For both software formats, the contractor shall provide all webcast viewers with "free" (no cost to the viewer) software for download to their computer, which enables them to monitor the NRC meetings being webcast.  The viewing software shall provide the viewer with an equivalent quality of video image and sound as the "RealNetworks" software currently used for the NRC's webcasting program.   The Contractor shall ensure that all required licensing arrangements are completed in order to make the webcast viewing software available for free download by NRC webcast viewers from the contractor's webcast website. At all times, the webcast vendor shall support at least 100 concurrent viewers in any combination of users between the two software formats of media players."  


QUESTION #5:	"Will NRC provide the Fiber connection from the control booth to the cabling location on the P-1 level"? Or; "Is this Fiber connection to be provided by the contractor"?
RESPONSE #5:	NRC has already established a dedicated line connection between the audiovisual control booth (room adjacent to the NRC Hearing Room) and the P1-11 telephone equipment room.   The webcast contractor shall be responsible for providing a dedicated line which can connect to this established NRC line at the P1-11 telephone room location and transport the NRC webcast signal from the P1-11 telephone room to the webcast vendor's offsite webcast infrastructure.  Webcast vendors are hereby advised that the established NRC dedicated line between the NRC Hearing Room's adjacent control booth and the P1-11 telephone equipment room is not a fiber connection.  Instead, it is an RG-6 coaxial cable with an F-type connector suitable for transporting a composite signal riding on RF on it (an RF signal).  (NOTE: You could currently attach this coax cable to the "cable-in" or "TV aerial-in jack" of a normal cable-ready TV and watch the NRC's composite signal of the Commission meeting to be webcast).  Additional NRC clarifications of the technical terms used herein are provided below:
			Composite: This signal has all the colour, brightness and synchronization information mixed together and sent on one wire.   In A/V gear you often see a yellow RCA jack (along with a red and white RCA jack).   The yellow is for the composite signal, and the red and white are for stereo sound.
			RF: Take a composite signal and then use it to modulate an RF signal and you get RF. This is what is received on a TV aerial.  RF is usually carried over RG-6 coax cable with F-type connectors.  In Montgomery county, this is what the cable guy hooks into your TV set.
			Additionally, webcast vendors are hereby advised that NRC will provide the webcast vendor with sufficient rack-space in the control booth room adjacent to the NRC Hearing Room (instead of the P1-11 telephone room) for the vendor to install the on-site equipment required to encode the NRC webcast composite signal and transmit it to the vendor's off-site webcast infrastructure.  
			To clarify this contract requirement, NRC hereby modifies the SOW to delete the following current language in Section VII NRC FURNISHED MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT of the SOW in its entirety "The NRC will provide the contractor onsite access for initial installation setup and shall provide limited space and power connection for the contractor's equipment.  The NRC shall video-tape the meetings to be webcast and provide the contractor with a combined signal feed (video, audio and closed-caption text) for the meetings designated by NRC for "live" webcasting.  For any "live" webcast that experiences a problem during the webcast which makes the "live" feed version unsuitable for use as the "archived" version of the meeting, or for any meeting not "live" webcast which NRC desires to be added to the webpage as an "archived" webcast, NRC will provide the Contractor a VHS tape of the meeting for use in establishing the "archived" version of the meeting on the webcast webpage.   The contractor shall be responsible for providing and maintaining all other support to perform the requirements of this contract.  The contractor shall monitor all contractor equipment located at the NRC site from an offsite location and shall not maintain a presence at NRC facilities."
	
			NRC hereby provides the following new language for Section VII NRC FURNISHED MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT "The NRC shall video-tape the meetings to be webcast and provide the contractor with a combined signal feed (video, audio and closed-caption text) for the meetings designated by NRC for "live" webcasting.  NRC will provide the webcast vendor with sufficient power and rack-space in the control booth room (which is adjacent to the NRC Hearing Room), for the vendor to install the necessary on-site equipment to encode the NRC webcast composite signal and transmit it to the vendor's off-site webcast infrastructure.  NRC will provide a dedicated line (an RG-6 coaxial cable with an F-type connector suitable for transporting a composite signal riding on RF on it "an RF signal") between the control booth room and the P1-11 telephone room, for use by the webcast contractor to transmit the encoded webcast signal to the P1-11 telephone room location.  At the P1-11 room location, the webcast vendor shall provide the dedicated line necessary to transmit the encoded webcast signal to the vendor's offsite webcast infrastructure.  For any "live" webcast that experiences a problem during the webcast which makes the "live" feed version unsuitable for use as the "archived" version of the meeting, or for any meeting not "live" webcast which NRC desires to be added to the webpage as an "archived" webcast, NRC will provide the Contractor a VHS tape of the meeting for use in establishing the "archived" version of the meeting on the webcast webpage.   The contractor shall be responsible for providing and maintaining all other support to perform the requirements of this contract.  The contractor shall monitor all contractor equipment located at the NRC site from an offsite location and shall not maintain a presence at NRC facilities.  The on-site assistance NRC will provide the webcast vendor for NRC "test" or "Live" webcasts is limited to ensuring the vendor's equipment is "turned-on" prior to a webcast and ensuring it is "turned-off" after conclusion of each webcast, if the vendor requests such assistance."   
	
			GUIDANCE: NRC has decided to have the webcast vendor install the necessary on-site webcasting equipment in the control booth room (adjacent to the NRC Hearing Room) instead of the P1-11 telephone room (as discussed during the on-site walk-thru held on March 13th, 2003) in order to simplify providing the vendor with periodic access to the equipment when necessary, and to enable NRC to easily assist the vendor with the task of ensuring the equipment is "turned-on" before a "Live" webcast and "turned-off" upon the webcast's conclusion.   NRC will not make any other adjustments to the vendor's equipment.
     
QUESTION #6:	"Can you provide an estimate, based on your current system, of the number of total and/or concurrent viewers of the "On Demand" archived sessions"?
RESPONSE #6: 	Refer to the SOW under Task-1, requirement #3 which states: "3. Have capacity to support up to one-hundred (100) concurrent webcast viewers at 150kbps".


QUESTION #7:	Dedicated fiber - What are your preferred vendors for telecom support for that building that supply fiber?
 RESPONSE #7:	We have no preferred vendor.


QUESTION #8:	Is a dedicated fiber line to our server a requirement or would a dedicated T1 or a VPN or some other less expensive secure mechanism also be acceptable?
RESPONSE #8:	Only a dedicated line is a requirement.   A dedicated "fiber" line is not a requirement.  Use of any existing NRC IT network to meet this requirement is prohibited.



QUESTION #9:	Is there an existing example security plan that you could make available to us for review prior to the proposal submittal date?
 RESPONSE #9:	No.


QUESTION #10:	Do you have a preference where our streaming servers might be physically located within the US?
 RESPONSE #10:	No.


QUESTION #11:	Is the webcast video (Eg. meeting & captions) going to be different then what you want archived (Eg. meeting only) ?
 RESPONSE #11:	No.  The NRC's composite signal for the "Live" webcast (which contains the audio, video and closed-captioning) is the same content that NRC wants the viewers to be able to access in the archived version.  The one difference between the "Live" webcast and its archived version is the length of the webcast because NRC does not want the webcast vendor to include the video of the pre-meeting testing (conducted prior to each "Live" webcast) in the archived version of each webcast.    


QUESTION #12:	Are both the webcast and the archives to be made available at all 3 bandwidths or just the webcast?
 RESPONSE #12:	Both "Live" and "archived" webcasts shall be made available in any combination of all 3 bandwidths.


QUESTION #13:	Would the NRC be responsible for a power up mechanism for the encoder box from the control room or would we?
 RESPONSE #13:	Refer to the response for QUESTION #5 which solves this issue.


QUESTION #14:	What is the existing fiber on P1 used for?
RESPONSE #14: 	Other functions, un-related to webcasting.


QUESTION #15:	Can it be used to transmit the composite video for remote encoding?
 RESPONSE #15: 	No.  It is the contractors responsibility to provide a dedicated line from the NRC room P1-11 telephone room to their offsite webcasting facility.  NRC will not allow the use of existing NRC lines between the P1-11 room and the contractor's location. 


QUESTION #16:	If yes, what bandwidth is available on the fiber?
RESPONSE #16:	See the previous response to Question #15.

QUESTION #17:	Does NRC have a preferred or current vendor for fiber connectivity out of the building?
 RESPONSE #17:	We have no preferred vendor.

QUESTION #18:	Does NRC prefer encoding to take place on or off-site?
RESPONSE #18:	Refer to Task-3 which states this requirement as follows: "For those meetings that NRC elects to webcast "live" (while the actual meeting is taking place), NRC will video-tape the meeting's events, add closed-captioned text of the meeting's discussions to "line-21" of the meeting's video image and create a combined feed of the meeting's content (video/audio & closed-caption text).   The Contractor shall capture the combined feed via the Contractor's connection to the NRC video-system at the NRC Headquarter's location in Rockville, Maryland, and:
			1.  encode the content to protect it from alteration and/or corruption;
	  		2.  transmit the content from the NRC Headquarter's location to the contractor's offsite webcasting infrastructure;
	  		3.  connect the content to the contractor's webcasting webpage;
	  		4.  provide free access to the "live" webcast content to all interested parties via the webcast webpage. "

QUESTION #19:	Does NRC have a preferred vendor for network connectivity?
 RESPONSE #19:	No preferred vendor.

QUESTION #20:	Is NRC providing the composite video feed from the control room to the P1 level network room (room P1-11)?
 RESPONSE #20:	Yes, see the response to question #5.


QUESTION #21:	Is NRC providing a rack and rack space on the P1 level?
RESPONSE #21:	Yes, NRC will provide a rack and rack-space on-site to accommodate the equipment required to encode and transmit the webcast signal from NRC to the contractor's webcast infrastructure.  However, the rack and rack-space will be in the control booth room adjacent to the NRC Hearing Room where the NRC meetings that are to be webcast are held.  Refer to the response for Question #5. 


QUESTION #22:	Live viewer history. Can you tell us how many viewers you have had in the past per live webcast? 
RESPONSE #22:	Vendors should plan on supporting at least 100 concurrent viewers during each "Live" webcast.

QUESTION #23: 	Connection Rates.  Can you supply us with a breakout of the speed those viewers connected at?  How many at 28.8k, 56k and 150k?
RESPONSE #23:	The breakout of viewer connection rates will change with every webcast based on who is interested in the topic of the NRC meeting being webcast.  Vendors should refer to the SOW for the specified webcast system capacities required by NRC.


QUESTION #24:	Do you currently have a dedicated T1 line or higher to supply us for the broadcast?
RESPONSE #24:	No.

QUESTION #25:	Do you want us to host the webpage for you on one of our servers or just develop it for you?
RESPONSE #25:	Refer to Task-2 in the the SOW which states "Requirement: Develop and host a webpage.  The  webpage shall be the host site for NRC webcast viewers to gain access to "live" and/or "archived" webcasts of NRC meetings via the Internet during the contract period.  To ensure compatibility and a consistent appearance and functionality of the Contractor ‘s webcast webpage with NRC's other webpages, the Contractor shall use the current webcast webpage developed by NIH as the model for developing the new webcast webpage. (Visit www.nrc.gov. and click on "Live NRC Meeting Webcast and Webcast Archive.") " 
QUESTION #26:	In reading all of the modifications that have been posted lately, we noticedthat modification #6 (which was intended to correct a problem with CLINS 16-19) has a problem.  These units now have a question mark in front of the hour designation.  I am assuming that you still want these units priced in half-hour intervals but I thought I'd give you a heads up about it.  It may present itself as a problem later on and I wanted to point it out in case it was important.


RESPONSE #26:    The unit of measure for CLINs 0016, 0017, 0018, and 0019 is  one-half hour.
(2)   FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT, TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OF OFFERS, PRIOR TO OR ON THE DATE AND HOUR SPECIFIED, MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER. 

(3)  Nothing follows.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis.  Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an invitation for bid (IFB) or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the United States Air Force (USAF).  No contract may arise by responding to this RFI.  Also, a response to this RFI does not require the Air Force to further respond. The Air Force will not provide you its views or opinions about your products or services.  No proprietary information should be provided under this RFI, since, once provided, it may be used by the government in the normal course of its business, including disclosure to the public.
The United States Air Force Communications Agency (AFCA/ITXP) is researching varieties of Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) architectures, and is interested in receiving commercial White Papers and other like documents detailing their cost, availability, capabilities, and benefits to assist in this research. It should be noted that the need for cost data to assist in the planning process, if even only rough order of magnitude data, is the primary driver behind this RFI.
 	Specifically, we would like to see representative data for Router-based, Server-based, and Switch-based VoIP systems, to include estimates of cost and time frames for systems (hardware/software) acquisition, installation, training, and sustainment (2-3 years); specific methods of maintaining high quality of service/quality of signal; and provisions for compatibility with Defense Switch Network (DSN) requirements and interface with the latest commercial TCP/IP developments/upgrades.  
Further, as signal security is an area of major concern relative to VoIP systems, responses should include a brief statement/appraisal of the status of VoIP systems in regard to compliance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-202, Computer Security; CJCSI 6215.01B (Policy for DoD Voice Networks, DSN Certification); and DoD Instruction 5200.40 "DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process" (DITSCAP), December 30, 1997.

Operational density/mission parameters are 700,000 users at 108 fixed bases worldwide, with provision for remote deployment of up to 20% of users. 

NOTE:  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT RFI (REQUEST FOR INFORMATION) IS BEING ISSUED FOR AFCA/ITXP.  QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS RFI AND SUBMITTALS IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI SHOULD BE SENT TO THE ATTENTION OF EITHER ED DASHMAN, 618-229-6810/6713, edward.dashman@scott.af.mil; ROLAND DUBOSE, 618-229-6810/6472, roland.dubose@scott.af.mil; or STEVEN STONER, 618-229-6810/6709, steven.stoner@scott.af.mil.

<DESC>The US Air Force intends to purchase up to 911 AN/PRQ-7 radio sets for Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) for the Combat Survivor Evader Locator System (CSEL) with Boeing Communications and Information Management Division (deliveries set to be completed by the 3rd Quarter of FY04).  The full rate production decision on the CSEL is set to made by the 2nd Quarter FY04.  Boeing is the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the CSEL system and is the only known company with the requisite knowledge capable of providing the production requirement within the required time period.  Interested parties are invited to submit a statement of technical capabilities which includes the following information: 1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact and telephone numbers, 2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other, 3) Experience in small/survival radios or similar technologies, and 4) The facilities to work at the appropriate security level.  Interested offerors must submit Statements of Capabilities (SOC) which clearly show that they are qualified to perform this effort.  Send your capability statements to SMC/CZK (ATTN: 1st Lt Tom Tortorella), 2435 Vela Way, Suite 1866, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659. Oral communications are not acceptable.  This acquisition is intended to fulfill urgent operational requirements.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to modify the contract for radio production and shall not be considered a request for offers.  Prospective contractors should submit information in writing no later than 21 April 2003 with well-documented evidence of their capability to meet all technical contractual requirements.  All production radios must be completely compatible with the CSEL system architecture as described below.  Technical Drawings, Interface Control Documentation or Detailed System Specifications are contractor proprietary and are not available to the public. SYSTEM OVERVIEW: The CSEL system provides the survivor/evader in the field (typically downed aircrew) with: precision Global Positioning System (GPS) based geoposition and navigation data, two-way over-the-horizon (OTH) secure data communications to Joint Search and Rescue Centers (JSRCs), OTH beacon operation, Line-of-Sight (LOS) voice communication, sweep tone and swept tone beacon capabilities. The CSEL system architecture is composed of three segments: Over-the-Horizon (OTH), Ground, and User.  The OTH segment operates in three modes each using one of three Communication systems: UHF Satellite Communications (UHFSATCOM), other assets and COSPAS (Space System for Search of Vessels in Distress [Russian translation])/Search and Rescue Satellite Assisted Tracking (SARSAT).  The UHFSATCOM mode supports two-way  secure data messaging between the AN/PRQ-7 radio and the JSRC workstation through the AN/GRC-242 UHF SATCOM Base Station (UBS) over a dedicated 5Khz channel.  AN/PRQ-7 transmissions are automatically acknowledged upon receipt at the UBS prior to display on a JSRC workstation.  A third OTH mode supports one-way secure messaging/geoposition from the AN/PRQ-7 using the Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) capability.  COSPAS-SARSAT provides non-secure, one-way data beacon transmission and is intended for emergency use above or below 70 degrees latitude where UHFSATCOM coverage is lacking. The Ground segment is composed of Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE) compliant CSEL JSRC application segment software.  This software must be installed on a DII COE compliant workstation connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), which links the JSRC workstation to the UBS.  In cases where a JSRC workstation can interface to a Tactical Receiving Application (TRAP), TRAP Receiving Equipment (TRE), LPI/LPD messages can be received directly from the TRE as well as from the UBS over SIPRNET. The User segment consists of the AN/PRQ-7 radio, J-6431/PRQ-7 Radio Set Adapter (RSA), Radio Set Mission Loading Software and a service-provided IBM compatible computer using the Windows 95 or NT operating system.  Loading software installed in an IBM compatible computer loads the mission parameters into the AN/PRQ-7.  These parameters include communications frequencies and modes, datum and waypoints, and an optional user password.  The RSA provides the physical and electrical interface between the IBM compatible computer and an AN/PRQ-7 and also between key fill devices and the AN/PRQ-7 for loading of GPS keys.  A second AN/PRQ-7 serves as the reference radios and is used to transfer GPS position, almanac, ephemeris, and time to the target radio.

<DESC>The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) is looking for sources to conduct a study for managing records in compliance with Federal laws and regulations.  NIMA does not have a paper-based record keeping system in place, or an established Electronic Records Management (ERM) system.  The need is to perform a comprehensive study of NIMA electronic and hard copy information systems and storage requirements based on retention policy and document the results of the study in the form of a report with recommendations on where and how to implement ERM.  Any ERM recommended solution must not only be robust to deal with very large volumes, it must also address how NIMA will be able to identify, capture, effectively control and maintain its enterprise and corporate information while meeting user needs, being user friendly, administratively sound, and fiscally responsible.  NIMA is looking for a contractor to perform the study that has experience in implementing record keeping systems, with the intent to receive from the contractor recommendations that help to avoid pitfalls associated with implementing electronic record keeping and include lessons learned from real world implementations.  NIMA components to be included in the study are located in the Washington DC area, Bethesda, MD area, Reston, VA area, St. Louis, MO area, and Arnold, MO area.  In order to have access to NIMA facilities, the contractor must have personnel immediately available who possess a security clearance level of TS/SI/TK.  At least one contractor person must have TS/SI/TK/B clearance to access one NIMA location.  Contractor should also provide their business size, type entity (SDB, 8(A), SB, etc.), any existing IDIQ contracts such as GSA MOBIS and a capability statement, not to exceed (NTE) ½ page in length.

<SUBJECT>Industry day #3 on Joint Tactical Radio System - Maritime/Fixed Site (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3.
<DESC>Notice of Industry Day for Joint Tactical Radio System - Maritime/Fixed Site (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3. POC:  Mark Lopez, SPAWAR 02-32, Contracting Officer, (e-mail address: mark.lopez@navy.mil or lopezm@spawar.navy.mil); commercial telephone (619) 524-7168. DESCRIPTION: The JTRS-M/F Program Office will hold the JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3 on 21-23 April 2003 at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), 4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127. JTRS-M/F INDUSTRY DAY #3 GENERAL SESSION.  On 21 April 2003, the JTRS-M/F Program Office will provide a status of ongoing acquisition planning efforts, including a discussion of current issues concerning the Cluster 3 system acquisition.  Government personnel not affiliated with the JTRS-M/F Program Office may also present briefs to provide additional information affecting the overall JTRS and Cluster 3 programs.  The detailed agenda for the General Session is under development and will be promulgated when finalized to those companies that respond to this announcement. The General Session will take place in SPAWAR Cantrell C (in the Old Town Complex) at 1300 PDT.  Any company that wishes to participate in this General Session must convey its interest to Mark Lopez, the JTRS-M/F Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO), by e-mail at mark.lopez@navy.mil or lopezm@spawar.navy.mil, or by commercial telephone (619) 524-7168 by 1600 EDT on 15 April 2003.  Please note that participation in the JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3 General Session is limited to three (3) representatives per corporation. Attendees are requested to provide their name, company represented, and citizenship. JTRS-M/F INDUSTRY DAY #3 ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS.  On 22-23 April 2003, Prime System Level potential offerors will be afforded a two-hour period of time to meet one-on-one with the JTRS-M/F Program Office.  During this two-hour period, Prime System Level potential offerors may present both their possible solution to the Cluster 3 system (in accordance with the JTRS-M/F System Specification) and questions or concerns to the Program Office.  The Program Office will attempt to address those questions and concerns, and may present its own questions to the potential offerors. As part of these one-on-one discussions, the Government requests that each Prime System Level potential offeror be prepared to discuss the opportunities and challenges - from technical (including how a particular radio does or does not meet the JTRS-M/F System Specification), cost, schedule, and programmatic perspectives - of a Cluster 3 acquisition strategy that includes a Directed Joint Tactical Radio (JTR) source, such as the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) JTR.  (Data sheets on the MIDS-Low Volume Terminal and the MIDS JTR are included for information.)  A written response addressing the advantages and disadvantages of an acquisition strategy that includes a Directed JTR component, such as the MIDS JTR, may be submitted by the Prime System Level potential offeror to Mark Lopez at any time prior to the offerors one-on-one session. USE OF NON-GOVERNMENT EXPERTS DURING ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS.  The JTRS-M/F Program Office utilizes non-government specialists for expert technical and programmatic support.  The program office desires that these specialists participate in the potential offerors' one-on-one sessions with the Government.  These specialists are employed by the following corporations: Booz Allen Hamilton DCS GRD INDUS Technology, Inc. Maxim Systems, Inc. Scientific Research Corporation, SRC Tele-Consultants Incorporated, TCI These corporations have filed with the SPAWAR Contracts Directorate (Code 02) a letter indicating their intention to neither compete for the JTRS-M/F contract as a prime contractor, nor subcontract with or advise any vendor that may compete for the JTRS-M/F contract.  Employees of the above corporations who support the JTRS-M/F Program Office have also filed Non-Disclosure Agreements with the SPAWAR Contracts Directorate that restrict those employees from releasing any information received from potential offerors to anyone outside of the JTRS-M/F Program Office. In addition to these corporations, MITRE Corporation, a Federally Funded Research and Development ,Corporation, also supports the JTRS-M/F Program Office.  The JTRS-M/F Program Office is in the process of obtaining a No Compete Letter from MITRE, but at the time of the release of this announcement, this letter has not been received.  MITRE personnel who support the JTRS-M/F Program Office have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements. Because the participating Prime System Level potential offerors are likely to provide proprietary information during the one-on-one meetings, the JTRS-M/F Program Office needs those offerors to submit to the JTRS-M/F PCO a statement on company letterhead indicating permission for JTRS-M/F program support contractors identified above to participate in the offerors' one-on-one presentations.  As an example, the Government requests that this Letter of Permission includes a statement such as "(Insert Offeror name) permits employees of Booz Allen Hamilton DCS GRD INDUS Technology, Inc. Maxim Systems, Inc. MITRE Corporation Scientific Research Corporation, SRC Tele-Consultants Incorporated, TCI who support the JTRS-M/F Program Office, to have access to any of  (Insert Offeror's name)'s proprietary information that (Insert Offeror's name) may present during its JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3 one-on-one presentation." The Government requests delivery of this letter by no later than 1600 EDT on 15 April 2003 to the following address: Commander, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, 4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127, Attn: Mark Lopez, Code 02-33.  Alternatively, the offeror can submit this statement electronically to mark.lopez@navy.mil by 1600 EDT on 15 April 2003. The Government also requests that if a participating Prime System Level potential offeror objects to any of the above identified contractors attending its one-on-one presentation, the offeror make its objection to Mark Lopez by letter or email at the above addresses no later than 1600 EDT on 15 April 2003. SCHEDULING ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS.  The JTRS-M/F Program Office will make all effort to meet with all interested Prime System Level potential offeror's; however, the number of one-on-one presentations that can be scheduled on 22-23 April 03 is limited.  Consequently, scheduling of the one-on-one sessions during these days will be prioritized by the following guidance (in order of decreasing preference): (1) Prime System Level potential offerors who submitted written responses to the two previously released JTRS-M/F CBD announcements (February 2003 and March 2003). (2) Prime System Level potential offerors who submitted written responses to one but not both of the previously released JTRS-M/F CBD announcements. (3) Prime System Level potential offerors who did not respond to either of the previously released JTRS-M/F CBD announcements, but wish to present their possible solution for the Cluster 3 system (in accordance with the previously released CBD announcements). If, due to time constraints during 22-23 April 03, the Government is unable to schedule a one-on-one session with a Prime System Level potential offeror that responds to this announcement, the Government will schedule a one-on-one meeting with that potential offeror at a future date at both parties earliest convenience. Prime System Level potential offerors that are scheduled for one-on-one meetings during 22-23 April 03 can invite to the meetings representatives from those corporations that comprise their potential JTRS-M/F teams. Vendor interest in scheduling a one-on-one session must be conveyed to Mark Lopez, by e-mail at mark.lopez@navy.mil or lopezm@spawar.navy.mil, or by commercial telephone (619) 524-7168 by 1600 EDT on 15 April 2003.  By 1600 EDT on 16 April, the JTRS-M/F Program Office will contact each vendor by email indicating the scheduled time and location for the Prime System Level potential offeror's one-on-one session. ACCESS TO SPAWAR OLD TOWN COMPLEX.  All vendors interested in participating in the JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3 General Session and/or One-on-One Session must coordinate visit clearance requests through the SPAWAR visit office.  More stringent access requirements may apply to non-US citizens and employees of non-US firms.  It is the responsibility of the vendor to resolve such issues. PARKING.  Parking at and around the SPAWAR Old Town Complex is limited and restricted.  Vendors participating in the JTRS-M/F Industry Day events are advised to plan accordingly. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The anticipated release date of the official JTRS-M/F Cluster 3 Request for Proposals is in the summer 2003, with contract award anticipated for first quarter calendar year 2004. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this announcement or at Industry Day and submittals will not be returned to the sender. Questions or requests for additional information regarding the JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3 may be directed to Mark Lopez.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This is Solicitation Notice No. AB133A-03-CQ-0055.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25.  

The Personal Locator Beacons (PLB) identified in this procurement are manufactured by McMurdo Pains-Wessex Survival Systems (PWSS).  PWSS manufactures two models of PLB, one with GPS position contained in the distress message transmission by means of an INTEGRAL GPS receiver, and one with out the GPS position contained in the distress message transmission.  The model names of these PLBs are the FastFind Plus and FastFind, respectively. 

The United States Coast Guard had conducted an exhaustive technical and performance based evaluation of PLBs and had identified PWSS as the best manufacturer of PLBs.  Due to the fact that an extensive and thorough technical and performance review of the best available PLBs with out integral GPS has already been recently conducted by the USCG, the national authority in marine safety, a second review is wasteful and would yield PWSS as the one and only responsible source for PLBs.  Furthermore, there are no manufacturers of PLBs, other than PWSS, that can provide a PLB with integral GPS and the following salient features listed in order of highest to lowest priority:  

1.  Integral GPS receiver 
2.  User-replaceable batteries
3.  Greatest range/selection of coldest operating temperatures
4.  Lightest weight (of models w/ integral GPS receiver)
5.  Smallest size (of models w/ integral GPS receiver) 
6.  30 meter positional accuracy
7.  20 minute (or better) positional updates
8.  Low Cost

NOAA personnel who would benefit from the added degree of safety provided by PLB technology have expressed a very strong desire for the FastFind Plus PLB due to it's integral GPS position reporting capability which greatly increases the time of rescue and therefore the safety of life at sea.  Other manufacturer's of PLBs offer models that have a GPS capability, but these units require the carriage of a separate GPS unit, an interface cable, and some degree of user configuration.  Due to additional requirements to enable the non-integral GPS PLBs to transmit a GPS position, they do not provide any value or additional degree of safety for NOAA personnel aboard boats.

The upcoming field season is rapidly approaching and in order to truly provide the safest working environment for NOAA personnel and to minimize the risk of a fatality accident, these items must be purchased and distributed as soon as possible. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Government to award this contract to McMurdo Pains-Wessex on a sole source basis.

The proposal shall prepared in accordance with FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors- Commercial Items, and the offer shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.  FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there are no addenda to this provision. FAR 52.212-5, Contract terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items is applicable.  Include the additional clauses 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-35; 52.222-36; 52.222-37; 52.223-9 (Alt. 1); 52.232-34. 

A minimum quantity of 247 units will be ordered for delivery in 2003 and at the Government's discretion a maximum amount of 2000 units may be ordered during the life of this contract. However, the Government will be obligated to order only the minimum quantities specified. The order must be placed with McMurdo Paines-Wessex no later than April 30, 2003, in order to ensure proper delivery for use during the upcoming field season. Proposal from McMurdo Paines-Wessex must be received no later than 2:00 PM, Pacific Time, April 18, 2003.

A Request for Proposals (RFP) will be prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 12.  For a copy of the solicitation, please fax a copy of your request to Crystina Elkins at (206)526-6025.
