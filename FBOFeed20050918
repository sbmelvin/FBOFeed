In order to effectively control, monitor and detect unauthorized access and/or connectivity to approved external Business Partner entities of the SNA network, SSA requires state-of-art SNA Firewall capabilities to protect mainframe systems.

<SUBJECT>D -- The Emergency Managers Weather Information (EMWIN)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-2005-EMWIN-RFI

<DESC>PURPOSE - This RFI is being issued to identify potential sources and products capable of enabling the public to receive and utilize NWS essential weather information.  It will allow the NWS to determine the interest of prospective manufacturers in designing, constructing and marketing systems for the reception of the Emergency Managers Weather Information (EMWIN) datastream or for software to make that information more valuable to EMWIN users.  The EMWIN satellite broadcast in its present form through the NOAA Geostationary Orbital Environmental Satellites (GOES) must undergo a change when the new generation of satellites is placed into service sometime on or before 2011.  Existing EMWIN receiving systems must be adapted or replaced to make the transition to the new satellite broadcast.    The NWS wishes to identify and inform a community of potential offerors who have an interest in marketing low cost and reliable products capable of accommodating the transition.

BACKGROUND – What is EMWIN? – The EMWIN system is a popular dissemination system providing a serial bit stream containing timely watches, warnings, forecasts, hydro-meteorological products, graphics and satellite imagery. The EMWIN data stream is prioritized to meet the needs of emergency managers. EMWIN uses NOAA’s GOES satellites and economical receive systems to disseminate and process this bit stream. L-band Satellite broadcast is accomplished via GOES-East and GOES-West and also rebroadcast in Pacific via PeaceSat.  In addition to L-band satellite broadcast, portions of the EMWIN data stream are also rebroadcast via VHF radio, in certain areas, and via the internet in it’s entirety via internet push technology.  Additional information may be found at:   http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/index.htm.
EMWIN Satellite Broadcast - The current EMWIN broadcast modulation is Dual Frequency Shift Keying (DFSK) at a user data rate of 9.6 kbps.  The service is transmitted from the GOES satellites using an L-band down-link frequency at 1690.725 MHz.  Additional information may be found at the following address:  http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/WINSAT.HTM

What must change? - Changes in the next series of GOES satellites, the GOES-N thru P constellation, have necessitated development of a service to be offered as a replacement and upgrade to the existing broadcast.  All current EMWIN users will need to migrate to newer technologies due to frequency, power and modulation changes.  In addition, EMWIN users and contractors have also stressed the importance of increasing the EMWIN data rate and keeping the cost of the GOES-N transition as low as possible.

PREPARATION FOR TRANSITION - EMWIN System Design & specifications – Working with NESDIS, the NWS has developed a system design and specifications for the use of potential offerors.   The next generation broadcast, EMWIN-N is a digital direct broadcast service with a frequency of 1692.7MHz.   The broadcast will be offset quadrature phase shift keying (OQPSK) modulation and convolutional rate 1/2 plus Reed Solomon forward error correction for additional gain.  The user data rate will be 19.2 kbps.  Details of the design and specification are now available at the following link:  http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc. 
 
Proof-of-Concept Development – To demonstrate the feasibility of a receiving system capable of meeting the new EMWIN system design, NESDIS has developed and constructed a proof-of-concept model system using hardware implementation for the intermediate-frequency (IF) conversion and a software-defined radio scheme for the demodulation.  Detailed information on the proof-of-concept design may be found within the specification at http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWIN-OQPSK%20Specifications%20Final.doc.  It is the intent of NWS to make the Demodulation and Decoding software and the dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that were developed available to the public at no charge.  The software may be downloaded at http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/EMWIN-N%20OQPSK%20software.htm.  Potential offerors are free to develop any alternative scheme which meets the system design and specification criteria.
Launch of GOES-N Satellite – The proof-of-concept model has been successfully bench-tested and further tests will be conducted after the launch of the GOES-N satellite on or about early September, 2005.   The results of these tests will be posted, when available, at:  
http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/transition/EMWINtstReptGOES-N.doc.  After completion of these tests, the GOES-N satellite will be placed in storage until required to replace the generation of GOES satellites still in service.  These older satellites will be replaced by the new generation on or before 2011, depending upon fuel consumption, premature failure or demand for capabilities only present in the new satellites.  Before being placed into operational service, the GOES-N satellite will be activated each year for a test period.

INVITATION – Potential offerors who may have an interest in exploring possible development of EMWIN products compatible with the new generation of GOES satellites are encouraged to send an e-mail expressing their interest and any questions to emwin.system@noaa.gov.  No telephone calls please!
These e-mails will be used to develop a mailing list to be used by the NWS in disseminating additional information on EMWIN and the GOES satellite evolution and as part of a list of those invited to participate in an EMWIN conference to be held in Silver Spring, MD in late 2005.
  
E-mail responses should include the following information:

1) Brief description of firm and current similar product lines;
2) Firm’s URL;
3) Any questions; and
4) An expression of interest in being on the mailing list and possible participation in a forthcoming conference in Silver Spring, MD in late 2005.

Submissions are due no later than October 18, 2005.

Interested parties who market EMWIN related products will be identified on a list of potentital offerors posted on the EMWIN website but without any endorsement by NWS.   

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES - Additional information on the EMWIN program and transition may be found on the EMWIN website located at the following address:

http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/emwin/index.htm.

DISCLAIMER – This RFI is issued by NWS solely for obtaining information for planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Proprietary information must not be submitted and  will not be accepted by NWS.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Interested parties are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Furthermore, no basis for claims against NWS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or NWS’s use of such information.
