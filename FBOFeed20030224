<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to fund the transfer of mission operations support of the WIRE spacecraft from the Small Explorers (SMEX) control center at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland, to the Bowie State University (BSU) Satellite Operations and Control Center (BSOCC), Bowie, Maryland. The BSOCC is a joint venture between BSU and Goddard. The BSOCC is currently responsible for mission operations of the SAMPEX mission and is funded by NASA through a grant. Both WIRE and SAMPEX were developed and launched under the SMEX Project of NASA's Explorers Program. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. NASA/GSFC intends to procure the following mission operations support from Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. (HTSI). The Authority is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. 1. HTSI is currently responsible for mission operations of the WIRE mission and it also supports the BSOCC with the operations of SAMPEX.  2. The HTSI SMEX Flight Operations Team (FOT) is trained and certified to operate both WIRE and SAMPEX spacecraft. 3. The HTSI FOT training program is used to train both new HTSI WIRE FOT members and to train BSOCC SAMPEX student command controller trainees. 4. The same program will be used to train BSOCC WIRE student command controller trainees. 5. In addition to HTSI's knowledge and experience with WIRE and the BSOCC, there exists communications links between the HTSI-operated SMEX control center and the BSOCC to facilitate the transfer of WIRE mission operations and subsequent training and technical support. 6. The WIRE ground data equipment will also be moved from the SMEX control center to the BSOCC. In conclusion, because of HTSI's current responsibility for WIRE mission operations, its current support of the BSOCC, its responsibility and ability to conduct WIRE FOT training, and the existing communications network between the SMEX control center and the BSOCC, it is the only reasonable company to support this transfer of mission operations. Additional information can be obtained in a Statement of Work, that is to be uploaded. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 11, 2003. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC) Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Program Office, AAC/YU, plans to utilize a Production Price Commitment Curve (PPCC) arrangement for multiple contract actions to award Lots 6 through 11 of the JDAM weapon system.  These  actions are anticipated to be awarded on a sole source basis to the McDonnell Douglass Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company (MDC/Boeing), as firm fixed-price efforts in accordance with the mutually acceptable prices for Lots 6 through 11.  To perform this effort, a contractor must have a detailed knowledge of the JDAM weapon system design, including all of its sub-components and be familiar with the system modes of operations to meet performance specifications.  At this time, the Government does not own a technical data package (TDP) for the JDAM weapon system.  The TDP is owned by MDC/Boeing, of P.O. Box 516, St. Louis MO 63166-0516.  The program office issued an initial synopsis for JDAM on 05 Jun 95 which addressed the overall acquisition approach of downselecting to a single contractor for award of EMD Phase II, Low Rate Initial Production lots and receipt of the PPCC for Lots 3 through 5.  Additional synopses were posted on 10 Jan 01, 14 Jan 00, and 16 Jun 99 addressing subsequent acquisitions of JDAM production assets.  Approximate period of performance for the total planned production quantity is expected to extend through FY 2009.  The JDAM Program Office estimates a total acquisition quantity of approximately 88,000 units. This synopsis does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government .  For contractual information concerning this synopsis, please contact the Contracting Officer, Ms. Bridget Tuominen, at (850) 882-3525, extension 3124.  For technical information, contact the Technical Director, Mr. James M. (Mike) Evans, at (850) 882-3525, extension 3203.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer or Technical Director identified above.   The Ombudsman is Dr. Mario J. Caluda, AAC/CD, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 123, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495; his phone number is (850) 882-5558.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   Request for Quotation No. RFQ-GA-03-00025 for Automated Sample Preparation System. The EPA, Region 4 is looking to purchase an automated sample preparation system to facilitate the sample preparation of environmental samples for the analyses of dioxins, furans, PCBs and persticides for the Environmental Chemistry Laboratory, John C. Stennis Space Center, MI.  Presently, the Enviromental Chemistry Laboratory's sample preparation procedure involves several clean-up steps prior to the actual analyses of samples.  Colllectively, they are performed to remove  co-extracted material and/or chemicals that interfere with the final analytical step.  These procedures include an acid/base silica step, an alumina column step and a carbon column procedure.  The automated system should be one that can perform at least these three steps automatically and  sequentially on at least 4-6 samples without having to be attended by a technician.  Moreover, the system must meet or exceed the present criteria which is measured by the recovery of carbon 13 labeled surragates that are added to the sample prior to the initiation of the samples preparation  procedure.  These recoveries must be equal to or greater than 75%.  The system must also be able to perform the entire operation without introducing contamination that would interfere with ultra-trace analyses. Vendor quotations to the above RFQ are required to be submitted by close of business on  03/20/2003.  Quotations may be submitted electronically to davidson.deborah@epa.gov or hard copy via fax to (404) 562-8370 or mailed to EPA Reg. 4 Procurement Section, Attn:  Deborah Davidson, 61 Forsyth St. Atlanta, GA 30341.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Charles Tilford, Gaithersburg, MD, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Only One Source Reasonably Available, for additional work relating to encasing the pages of the U.S. Constitution at the National Archives II in College Park, MD for transfer to the National Archives I in Washington, D.C.  Previously, pages one and four of the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence had been encased.  The additional work now includes encasing the transmittal page of the U.S. Constitution, plus pages two and three, and the re-encasement, due to bubbles in the glass interlayer, of pages one and four. The gas filling operation will include:  checking the calibration of all "pop up" instrumentation and their integration with the existing data acquisition system; leak testing of the C-seal after installation of the documents; assembly, and removal of gas-fill apparatus; and, data acquisition during and immediately after filling the encasements, reviewing all work to ensure quality and completeness. Data analysis will also be performed, resulting in a report detailing the results of the gas filling operation and a final archival quality report will be submitted summarizing the gas filling procedures and data.  Assistance with monitoring the cases during the move from Archives II to Archives I is also necessary.  This is a sole source requirement as the contractor:  a) designed the gas extraction system and has operated it on an encasement containing one of the Charters of Freedom; b) designed the on-board instrumentation package and specified all the components; c) calibrated the pressure sensors; d) specified the components for the flow regulation system used for filling the encasements; and, e) developed the leak test protocol.  Use of any other contractor would unnecessarily increase the risk of damage to the nation's founding documents.  A fixed price modification will be issued to the existing Purchase Order to cover the additional encasements and data analysis on or about 03/10/03 with a performance period of six months.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 514120 and the size standard is $6.0 mil.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing.  This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, the Government will consider all responses received by the closing date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona file capability to fulfill the requirement.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) is not available.  See notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with HyTest, Ltd. In Turku, Finland for the purchase of (30) thirty milligrams of Human Cardiac Troponin Complex and (2) two milligrams of Human Cardiac Troponin I subunit.
***Sole source determination is based on the need for this Human Cardiac Troponin to be of the highest quality for the preparation of NIST Standard Reference Materials. HyTest, Ltd., along with several other suppliers of human cardiac troponin complexes, have been evaluated in two inter-laboratory comparison studies in cooperation with the American Society for Clinical Chemistry to determine their ability to standardize commercial clinical cardiac troponin assays. The results of both studies indicated that the cardiac troponin complex from HyTest, Ltd. performed better than the complexes from the other suppliers. Therefore, procurement of the cardiac troponin complex from any other supplier would require the complex to be evaluated through one or more inter-laboratory comparison studies, which would result in costly delays in the production of NIST's Standard Reference Material. 
***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 30 days after receipt of order.
***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 325413, and the size standard is 500 employees.
***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by February 27, 2003 @ 12 noon EST.  
***A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any questions or concerns regarding this "notice of intent" should be forwarded in writing to the Contracting Officer (Joni Laster) via e-mail @ joni.laster@nist.gov no later than February 27, 2003 @ 12 noon EST.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification 03 to BAA03-06 is to instruct reviewers to ignore Modification 02 and Amendment 01 posted on 24 FEB 03.  Modification 03 herein is applicable.  The purpose of MODIFICATION 03 to BAA03-06 is to incorporate Technical Topic Area #18 entitled Connectionless Networks, and to provide specific instructions for Submission of Proposals by interested parties.

1. Reference Industry Day Workshop Announcement entitled Connectionless Networks, Solicitation Number SN03-10 posted on 20 FEB 2003.

2.  BAA03-06 is modified as follows: 
a.  The following Technical Topic Area is added to BAA03-06 under the heading of TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS:  (18) Connectionless Networks
b.  For the new Technical Topic Area added herein, respondents are directed to bypass Step 1 - Executive Summary, and Step 2 - Proposal Abstract, and proceed directly to Step 3 - Full Proposal Submission, as described in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) to BAA03-06.  Respondents are directed to comply with all other requirements of the PIP for BAA03-06, unless the information described in the Modification herein specifically instructs the respondent to do otherwise.
c.  Respondents are directed to provide their Full Proposal Information to the Government for evaluation purposes within 45 days of the posting of this Modification in FedBizOpps, and no later than 12:00pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) on that applicable date.

3.  The following specific information related to Topic Area (18) Connectionless Networks is applicable:

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:
The Connectionless Networks (CN) program will develop technology to allow radio networks to send and receive messages without any initial link acquisition, or any previous sharing of routing information.  This will, in turn, improve energy per bit of delivered information by as much as 100 - 1000 times compared to conventional and near-term deployable communications systems such as contemplated by both commercial and military users.

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
The approach is to exploit current signal processing components, intelligent (processing and memory intensive) routing, and availability of situational information to demonstrate a total energy savings of at least 100 times typical connection oriented network applications, such as DARPA SUO SAS .  Initially candidate technologies and designs will be investigated and modeled.  This would be followed with fabricated devices that implement this technology.  These very significant increases in efficiency will arise from a number of sources, including:
* Elimination of the acquisition preamble, through use of pre-corrected frequency and timing, and multiple hypotheses detection.
* Consolidation of physical, media access, network and transport layer headers and elimination of the requirement to distribute routing information throughout the network
* Scalability beyond the node counts possible with Internet technology within a small Service area.

This phase of the CN Program will address Integrated Layer Design and Performance Prediction.  This approach will investigate specific technology requirements for each of the ISO layers, leading to the development and analysis of sets of Implicit Protocols.  The effort will consider both layer-specific and layer-integrating approaches, with particular attention given to combining the physical layer and media access, and to the functionality of a network and transport layer.  A simulation-based approach will be implemented to identify promising techniques for further development in the later phases. 

A significant challenge in defining the combined Physical and Media Access Layer is the development of Acquisitionless link operation.  This will require that receiver and transmitter be closely matched in time, frequency, carrier phase, and clock interval.  Implicit determination of phase (for interesting symbol rates) is beyond the accuracy of the low power and miniature time sources available today (although MEMS Atomic clocks and Direct Synthesis may address this shortfall in the future).  

Defining the Network and Transport Layer packet routing operation will require development of a unique solution from the techniques used in the Internet Protocol (IP) family.  These are optimized for static and relatively persistent connectivity.  Even the dynamic SUO SAS radio establishes a fixed connectivity and subnet structure for variable durations.  

During this phase, it is envisioned that multiple organizations will be provided the opportunity to investigate specific aspects of the CN technology.  Multiple approaches will be investigated for layer-specific and layer-integrating approaches, and analysis will predict the performance that can be achieved.  The analysis will address implementation complexity, on-board processor and memory capability/power, overhead, scalability and performance.

PROPOSAL FORMAT & SUBMITTAL INFORMATION 
NOTE:  For submission of proposals herein, the following information supercedes that delineated in the PIP for BAA03-06:  Except for the attached bibliography or as noted below, Volume I shall not exceed thirty (30) pages. Where appropriate, maximum page lengths for  particular sections are shown in braces { } below. Otherwise, the number of pages for each section is at the discretion of the proposing organization (so long as the 30 page limit is not exceeded).  Offerors should not propose efforts exceeding twelve (12) months.  Any such proposal doing so may be disregarded.  Multiple awards during CY 2003 are anticipated.  Follow on efforts may be conducted at a later time, either through DARPA or a Military Services Agent, however, the government is under no obligation to conduct any follow on effort. Proposal Submissions are expected to be unclassified, but in the event any portion thereof may be classified, respondents are instructed to follow the information delineated in the PIP to BAA03-06.

GENERAL INFORMATION:
The Government intends to use employees and subcontractors of SRA International, Inc. (Adroit C4ISR Center) of Fairfax, Virginia and DPM Consulting to assist in administering the evaluation of the proposals and to provide advice regarding portions of the technical content of the proposals to the Government evaluators.  These personnel will have signed, and will be subject to, the terms and conditions of non-disclosure agreements.  By submission of its proposal, an offeror agrees that its proposal information may be disclosed to employees of SRA and/or DPM Consulting for the limited purpose stated above.  Only Government evaluators, however, will make technical evaluations and award determinations under this BAA.

Questions of a technical nature should be addressed to Preston Marshall, DARPA/ATO, email: pmarshall@darpa.mil. The Alternate point of contact for technical questions is Vic Jaroch, email: vjaroch@snap.org. Questions of a contractual nature should be addressed to Anthony E.

<CONTACT>Carolyn Haynes, 907/753-2545
<DESC>NA This action was originally published in Fedbizops 21 Feb 2003. The following will replace the previous Description of Work in its entirety. THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT’S INTENT TO AWARD TO ONE SOURCE.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302, the governmen t intends to award a sole-source contract to Organizational Excellence International,14 Homestead Ridge Hattiesburg, MS 39401  for facilitation services for the Bassett Army Replacement Hospital. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District intends to  acquire all services necessary to perform facilitation services. Work includes, but is not limited to providing two facilitators for 17 Apr 2003 (and 2004 – 2006), to facilitate a one-day partnering workshop.  Hours expected to be:  17 Apr 03, 0800-1700hr s.  The workshop will be conducted in Fairbanks, Alaska.  This workshop is an annual partnering meeting to be held in April (or coordinated otherwise) of every year during the construction of the Bassett Hospital (2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006).  The facilitat or is responsible for coordinating with the Bassett Resident Office on the date of the annual partnering meeting. PROCURE MEETING FACILITIES: The facilitator is responsible for providing the meeting facilities at a Hotel in Fairbanks large enough to provid e a Conference Room that will hold 80 people, a projector view screen, and podium.  The Hotel will also need to be able to block out 40-50 sleeping rooms for out of town attendees (Government and Non-Government).  The conference room will need to be arrang ed from 8 AM to 5 PM for one day only on the day of the annual partnering workshop, along with two smaller (holding up to 25 folks each) breakout rooms, from 1-5 PM, the same day.  The 40-50 sleeping rooms will be occupied for 4 nights, with some variation  depending on the individual's schedules.  The dates for the reservation of rooms will be coordinated with the Bassett Resident Office. We will want the Hotel to provide both morning (10 AM) and afternoon (1430) coffee/pop snack service for 80 people.  The  Hotel will need to provide a Partner Lunch from 1200-1300 on the day of the annual partnering workshop also.  Note that the number of sleeping rooms used in that facility affects the price for conference facilities. The facilities will be available at 070 0 on the day of the annual partnering workshop to allow time for set-up.  The facilitator shall bear all costs associated with providing all materials required for the workshop (i.e. partnering notepads/folder, pencil, pens, tapes, and easels with self-sti ck writing pads for all workgroup tables) and ensure that they are available.  The facilitator will also provide an LCD Projector compatible with a Standard laptop PC and projection screen.  Additional electrical equipment, to include power strip, extensio n cord, etc…will be furnished by the facilitator, as well.  PREPARE WORKSHOP AGENDA: The facilitator shall prepare an agenda based on all materials provided, and any teleconferences.  The agenda shall be presented in MS Word, via electronic means, in draft  form no later than 30 days prior to partnering session.  Upon receipt of comments or requested changes either verbally or by electronic means  (NLT 14 days prior to session), said changes will be incorporated and a final agenda shall be presented in MS Wo rd, via electronic means, no later than 7 days prior to session. FACILITATE WORKSHOP: The facilitator shall actively participate in, and facilitate discussions for the entire workshop, to include set-up activities, 17 Apr 03.  Facilitator will maintain pos itive control over the workshop and guide it accordingly when and if tensions should heighten.  Facilitator will ensure that ground rules are stated at the beginning of the workshop and adhered to throughout the duration of the workshop.  Facilitator will perform a recap at the close of 17 Apr 03.  Facilitator will be responsible for issue and collection of a partnering critique. DOCUMENT WORKSHOP: The facilitat or shall provide a minute taker.  Facilitator shall further provide documentation of the workshop in MS Word to include capture of the final attendance, key points presented, summary of discussion, action items, resolutions, and critique results.  For firm s who wish to provide a proposal based on the requirements, please notify the contract specialist for a more detailed scope of work.  The proposal must be submitted by 12:00 Alaska time February 28, 2003 to fax (907)-753-2544, phone (907) 753-2555, Attenti on to:  Daniel J. Werkmeister, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District, Contracting Division, or email to:  Daniel.J.Werkmeister@poa02.usace.army.mil.     Technical Requirements:  The contractor would need to develop a comprehensive understanding of the goals, expectations, and issues for the Bassett Army Hospital Replacement Project. The contractor will need to be familiarized with all current issues for al l subsequent partnering sessions. The Government will realize the benefits of first hand knowledge associated with issue development and the establishment of goals. It is estimated that a total of 40 hours review time for each partnering session previously  conducted would be required for a new facilitator to review all relative project documentation. This review would be required for the facilitator to develop an understanding of project scope, review previous partnering minutes, and interview/query team me mbers.  A comprehensive understanding of these subjects must be obtained prior to the start of the partnering workshop, a reading of the partnering minutes and associated documentation alone will not suffice.  All proposals will be evaluated by Price and how they meet the technical requirements for this workshop. Upon completion of the workshop the facilitator shall prepare a draft workshop report in electronic format and provide it no later than 7 days after partnering to the Bassett Resident Office.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00421-03-R-0022 solicits/requests proposals for the study of the aging properties of fiber optics in a Naval aircraft environment. Responses to this BAA will be accepted at the Contracting Office for a three (3) month period from the date of this announcement and are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  Contract award will be based on a scientific and engineering evaluation of the response (technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) to determine the merit of the technical approach used. Of primary interest are studies that characterize the life expectancy of aviation grade fiber optic cables when they are placed in a Naval Aviation-like environment, which combines humidity, vibration and temperature variations into a single, all encompassing test.  Naval Air Systems Command, Aging Aircraft IPT, AIR 4.1D, is interested in receiving proposals regarding the study of the aging properties of fiber optic cables in a Naval aviation environment. The situation that we are looking to characterize is as follows:  Several studies have shown that moisture (humidity) can permeate certain fiber claddings in a relatively short period of time.  These studies have also indicated that this may weaken the fiber as well as degrade the optical signal and the cable?s available bandwidth.  Additionally, the studies show that these effects are accelerated by large temperature swings, vibration and stressing.  Overall this may effect the expected lifetime of the fiber.  No information concerning the lifetime of fiber in a Naval aviation environment exists in the available literature.  The Joint Council on Aging Aircraft is attempting to look ahead and address areas that may be a future Total Ownership Cost issue.  This study would require the analysis of aviation grade fibers placed in an environment similar to the one found in Naval aircraft in an effort to determine their aging properties.  Several studies have been published in journals regarding the effects of environment - particularly moisture - on the useful lifetime of fiber.  Today's fibers are being used in a number of applications including aircraft.  While the aircraft environment may be similar to other stressful environments, it is different enough that we cannot adequately address this issue without a detailed study.    Additionally, while the fibers in use today have been tested for individual environments, they have not been tested in a combined environmental test.  The proposal will be to study possible aviation grade fibers to characterize their properties in hopes of identifying the expected lifetime of these various fibers, identify which fibers performs best over time, and to see if the aviation environment causes fibers to behave unexpectedly.  This information should be useful to the Naval aviation industry and customers because it could allow for either changing their selected fiber, changing their method of installation, or planning for scheduled maintenance. The object is risk and cost reduction.  Proposals may be submitted anytime during the three (3) month period following publication of this announcement. Proposals may address one or more of the concepts listed above. Proposals shall be limited to exploratory development where feasibility has already been demonstrated. More than one proposal may be submitted.  Early submission is encouraged. Proposals may be evaluated as they are received or may be collected and reviewed periodically. The merit of the proposals shall be determined based on the following criteria: (1) Overall scientific and technical merit, (2) the offeror's ability to demonstrate feasibility; (3) the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives, and (4) realism of proposed cost. Please provide a detailed breakdown of approach, available resources, proposed cost/prices, and a preliminary schedule so an analysis can be performed. Technical proposals shall not exceed twenty-five (25) pages. Contractors shall submit one (1) original and four (4) copies of their proposal to Contracts Group, Attn: Darrall Lafayette, Code 251315, NAVAIRSYSCOMHQ, Bldg 441, Unit 7, 21983 Bundy Road, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127. The cost of preparation of the response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to the resulting contract or any other contract. The point of contact for technical issues is Mr. Dan Slick (301) 342-2275, e-mail: slickdg@navair.navy.mil. Mr. Darrall Lafayette (301) 757-8956, email: lafayettede@navair.navy.mil is the point of contact for contractual matters. Offerors may contact these individuals, at any time, for clarification of technical/contractual issues and cost response format. In addition, a question and answer document under this BAA will reside on the following website for questions received of a general nature: http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm. Offerors are cautioned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. For planning purposes, the period of performance is estimated to be from 3 to 6 months at a level of effort of 0.5 to 3 man-years per year for each contract. Reasonable deviations / exceptions will be considered. Contract type will be a firm fixed price completion. No formal solicitation will be issued; this BAA is the solicitation.

Subject:	Request for Qualifications - 70004-000-03-35

Dear Sir/Madam:

Los Alamos National Laboratory requires technical support in the areas described in the attached documents (Statement of Work and General Qualifications). All potential offerors are requested to provide detailed statements of their qualifications and expertise in those technical areas.  Qualifications Statements are limited to 15 typewritten pages at a font size no less than Courier 12.  Resumes may be submitted which do not count against the 15 page limitation.  No more that 2 resumes per technical area may be submitted and all resumes are limited to 2 pages.  To be considered, qualifications statements must specify the business size and SIC code used to establish business size. Qualifications statements are due in my office by close of business 13 Mar 03. A response by electronic mail is preferred. Alternatively, responses may be faxed to 505-665-6202, or sent by priority mail to: James R. Jefferis, BUS-5, TA-3,SM-261, MS P215, 505-667-5331, Los Alamos National Laboratory, SM-30 Bikini Atoll Road, Los Alamos, NM 87545.

Requests for Proposals (RFP) will be sent only to those firms who respond to this request and who are determined to be qualified to respond by Los Alamos.  Determination of a firm's qualification to provide the required support is the sole determination of Los Alamos.  Subsequent to submission of Qualification Statements, no communication will be made to respondents prior to issuance of the RFP.  Los Alamos anticipates that this requirement will be unrestricted.  However, we reserve the right to limit this requirement to small businesses only if a sufficient number of qualified responses from small businesses are received.

Los Alamos intends to issue a Time and Materials Task Order Agreement for this requirement.  Period of performance is for 3 years and the subcontract awarded is expected to have a ceiling of $400,000.

In evaluating potential offerors abilities to support the following SOW, emphasis (but not the sole factors evaluated) will be placed on the following:

? Significant hands-on experience in radiation testing of candidate electronic piece parts and evaluation of integrated subsystem "hardness";

? Demonstrated ability to accomplish said radiation testing at external facilities or at the offeror's facility; and 

? Significant expertise and experience in performing objective reliability analyses of electronic systems, including acquiring the requisite component failure rate data when not available at Los Alamos.


Should you have any questions, please contact me.

Sincerely,

/signed/

<DESC>USPS MPI LOCAL AREA NETWORK PLANT WIRING

ANNOUNCEMENT OF SUPPLIER PREQUALIFICATION REQUEST AND REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL

The United States Postal Service (USPS) is pre-qualifying sources for its RFP requirement for advanced Structured Plant Network Wiring initiative called Mail Processing Infrastructure (MPI).

REQUIREMENT

Currently, USPS has approximately 38,000 retail outlets providing customer services throughout the United States; delivers more than 650 million pieces of mail each day, 25.5 billion pounds each year, and supports one of the largest federal information systems (IS) in the world. The successful supplier(s) will review, design, test, install, test and deliver state-of-the-art structured plant wiring, to support existing programs and infrastructure initiatives for USPS.

MPI is ultimately targeted for approximately 162 of the largest USPS facilities, which are located throughout the United States. Between fifty and sixty-five of the sites will be covered by this solicitation.  Offerors pre-qualifying for the base amount will also pre-qualify for subsequent RFP?s for as many as 200 additional sites.  These large facilities include mail Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DCs), Mail Processing Offices (MPOs), Air Mail Facilities (AMFs), Associated Offices (AOs) and Bulk Mail Centers (BMCs). The proposed initiative consists of a phased-in approach to replace base-band wiring with structured wiring consisting of unshielded, twisted-pair (UTP) copper and multimode fiber optic cable. Once cabling is complete, an upgraded LAN environment will be implemented to support local Mail Processing Equipment (MPE). Depending on the facility size, each facility operates between 15 to 180 automated MPE systems, which will be sustained by this advanced MPI initiative.

It is imperative to USPS that the supplier(s) selected for award is well qualified and guarantees its work and the work of its subcontractors.

All work must be completed by 5/15/04.  Award is expected in the June 2003 timeframe.  The Postal Service may award more than one contract as required to perform the work.  The requirement will be a unit-priced Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) requirement similar to the GSA Federal Supply Schedule format.  After award the contractor will do site surveys, make measurements agreeable to both parties, and provide a fixed-priced proposal based on the measured units agreeable to the Contracting Officer?s Representative.  Fixed prices shall not be based on any factors other than those in the IDIQ contract bidding schedule.

SUPPLIER PRE-QUALIFICATION

As a prerequisite to receiving an RFP, suppliers must submit a prequalification request.  Prequalification requests will be accepted until COB of the seventh day preceding the date the RPF is issued.  That RFP date is currently expected to be March 30, 2003.  Prequalification requests received after the seventh day may be considered, but the Postal Service will not issue the RFP to that offeror until it has been pre-qualified, and those offerors may have fewer days to submit proposals as a result.

Potential suppliers must demonstrate and describe in their proposal a proven ability to implement major structured wiring projects and LAN environments. Companies must have experience with national deployments similar to this one and have the ability to perform in the 50 states of the United States.  Companies will only be considered if they have previous experience completing projects of this type and magnitude. Examples of and references from several successful projects, which include facility jobs in excess of $500,000, must be provided.  Successful projects include projects that met target dates for completion, came in at or under budget, and exceeded the client's expectations. 

Fully trained and accredited staff.  Wiring designers must have formal training and must be certified as having Building Industry Consulting Service International (BlCSl) designation of a Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD).  On staff, qualified designer consultation must be provided to review and approve all designs for each facility job. Wiring technicians and installers must be formally trained and certified by a nationally recognized organization. 

Demonstrated accountability for and coordination of all subcontractors.   Any subcontractor must also meet the same high level training and certification standards required of the contractor and must exhibit equivalent large facility experience and manufacturer certifications. 

Sound finances.  The contractor and any subcontractors must have sufficient financial capabilities to support project(s) of this scale.  Financial statements may be required as appropriate.
 
Demonstrated ability to form strategic alliances and partnerships.   A requirement of this solicitation is a total system solution warranty for 15 years. The successful vendor(s) will have to form alliances with the product and multiple service suppliers as appropriate to back such a warranty.

National Scope.   The contracted vendor must be national in scope and have the demonstrated reach necessary to effectively manage a project of this magnitude. The contractor must show reputable ability to manage multiple projects in different geographic locations and a wide variety of challenging and varying facilities.

Demonstrate a clear understanding of current industry implementation standards and codes.   The supplier must show demonstrated ability to work in a highly industrialized and mechanized work environment and knowledge of all related industry implementation standards and codes, including applicable national, state, and Iocal construction codes.  Experience with asbestos related and historical building issues is desired.  Asbestos-related work will likely be encountered and must be dealt with by the supplier, but this work will be considered out of scope.

Familiarity with the USPS contracting procedures.   An understanding and knowledge of the USPS environment, including purchasing policies, is desired.

PREQUALIFICATION SUBMISSION

Interested suppliers should immediately submit a statement of qualifications detailing their capabilities in the areas above.  The statement of qualifications should be no more than 30 pages, single sided, in not less than 10 point font (with one inch margins) inclusive of cover letters, sales literature, etc,, on 8 W' X 11" sheets plus no more than 10 additional charts, graphs or PowerPoint slides. Financial statements and annual reports will not be included in the page count. The supplier should also submit a list of current customers and customer contact information, which will be kept confidential.  Reference customers should include business projects similar in size and scope to the proposed Structured Plant Wiring initiative for the USPS, During or after review of the information provided, USPS intends to issue a formal solicitation for proposal to only those suppliers found to be best qualified.

One original and four (4) hard copies are required. Additionally, two (2) electronic copies will be submitted; in two formats, One electronic copy will be submitted as a single file in Adobe Acrobat format, and one electronic copy will be submitted as a single file in Microsoft Word.

Written prequalification responses should be submitted to the USPS within 10 calendar days after this posting.

<DESC>NA HQ, Joint Munitions Command (JMC), Department of Army, is hosting an Integrated Process Team (IPT) on March 12 – 13 at the Rock Island Arsenal, in Rock Island, Illinois.  The purpose of the IPT is to further define JMC’s need for identification tags to be used to track Container Roll-in/Out Platform (CROP) flatracks, both CONUS and OCONUS.  The tags are likely to use radio frequency or global positioning technology to help JMC with maintaining accountability of approximately 14,000 CROPs. The goal of the IPT is for government and industry representatives to work together to jointly develop a performance-based statement of work to be used to contract for the production of the tags. Contractors are invited to attend and participate in the IPT , at their own expense.  It is hoped that industry participation will help the government better define their requirement and provide information useful in developing cost estimates.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12.  The NAICS code is 541511 with a small business size standard of $18 million.

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), under the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Altum Inc., 14901 Bogle Drive, Suite 104, Chantilly, VA 20151 for the service of providing professional support of the ChemIDplus public chemical dictionary system as described below.  This requirement is for a base year at the option of two one-year periods.  

The services to be performed include but are not limited to creation of new simple and advanced interfaces to ChemIDplus; addition of searching functionality; upgrade of the DBMaint system; creation of XML and chemical name data on request; usage tracking.

The ChemIDplus database is a public web-based search system that provides access to structure and nomenclature and numeric data to identify chemicals cited in NLM's databases and in other major biomedical resources.  The database contains over 365,000 chemical records of which over 151,000 include chemical structures data.  The software used by ChemIDplus includes MDL Chemscape Server and ISISHost, Netscape Enterprise Server, and Oracle.  There are also online and batch maintenance systems used to add and correct data in the database.

Altum, Inc. (then doing business as Custom Software Services (CSS)) developed the ChemIDplus database.  Altum, Inc. developed a special set of Java proprietary software programs that are used to update the NLM ChemIDplus database, online or in batch mode.  The Java framework software was developed for maintenance and system upgrades as required by NLM.  NLM determined that Altum, Inc. is the only source to provide specialized services on the ChemIDplus retrieval and maintenance systems due to the complex nature of the file which is multidisciplinary, linking chemical, biological and biochemical data in a relational database.    Altum Inc. personnel have vital knowledge of the ChemIDplus system and will provide software expertise specific to the ChemIDplus software at a level not found in other SIS contractors.
