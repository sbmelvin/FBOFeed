<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The overall technical objectives of this BAA are to research innovative, disruptive technologies and methods for the automatic and dynamic cueing and collection of intelligence for situational awareness and assessment, with an emphasis on Machine-to- Machine (M2M) capabilities. Technologies, such as artificial intelligence, ontological reasoning, and knowledge-based processing will be used to: (1) Automate the exploitation of collected, processed, and stored information in support of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) within air, space and cyberspace for on-going US missions; (2) Enhance the US exploitation system efficiency, to include multi-platform collections, multi-intelligence correlation, and resource optimization and management; (3) Dynamically characterize and correlate raw sensor data from existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems; and (4) Automate knowledge-based exploitation for Effects-Based Operations (EBO) through assessment, cueing, electronic attack, and battle damage assessment, as a means to achieve mission objectives. These capabilities will enable both automated and "man-on-the-loop" (MoTL) concepts to address the increased volume of data and the increased time criticality of analysis - both of which are necessary to support dynamic exploitation and real-time EBO.</p>
<p>The focus areas of this BAA are to: (1) Dynamically characterize and correlate data sources on existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems; (2) Enhance collection system efficiency to include multi-platform collection for dynamic exploitation; (3) Automate knowledge-based assessments to cue sensors and recommend opportunities to achieve mission objectives; and (4) Automate exploitation of collected, processed, and stored information in support of ISR and Information Operations for current and future US missions. Some of the particular issues related to these specific focus areas include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) Target specific characteristics for identification/ correlation. Battlefield management depends heavily on multi-intelligence assets to provide current threat analysis for successful deployment of war-fighting resources. One area that supports this analysis is target specific operating characterization and equipment/unit correlation, which is normally a "brute-force/labor intensive" effort. (b) Automated collection, signal ID, and first/second/third order level processing. Dense, hard-to-get, advanced modulated, and Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) signals, as well as movements and hidden assets, dictate the need for automated, dynamic collection using both on-board and off-board assets. Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT) &lsquo;fingerprinting' techniques should continue to be investigated as a means of supporting identification and automated tracking efforts. (c) Related enabling engineering constructs and architectures to enable advanced exploitation. For example, the Semantic Service Oriented Architecture (SSOA) construct contextualizes the dynamic knowledge available, thereby enabling dynamic discovery of new services as they become available and providing resources for enabling semantic descriptions of those services. SSOAs enable knowledge acquisition and management over disparate architectures without a priori schema information. Semantic SOA development will provide a flexible way to quickly integrate novel services using an intelligent matching process. Approaches are sought which will allow heterogeneous services to seamlessly interoperate and which may include the use of data mediation/intermediary translation services such as data transformation, aggregation, service orchestration and adaptation. A standards based design approach will be used, and as appropriate, will be compliant with all International Standards and with the Net-Centric. (d) Management software aboard platforms and systems which specifically address exploitation mission objectives. Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on advanced collection platforms, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Resident management software processing systems will need to accomplish the automated, dynamic collection of intelligence information as well as auto-collaborating with other sensors in order to share information and to derive knowledge. (e) Advanced knowledge-based processing for exploitation. Timely and accurate decision support to the warfighter requires innovative knowledge-based processing for sensor management, emitter and entity identification, and multi-intelligence cross-cueing, to include, but not limited to, techniques for automated knowledge acquisition and knowledge modeling, real-time inferencing, and real-time operating system. (f) Network-centric collection management, data/information exchange and correlation. Networked SIGINT sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect difficult and hard-to-collect intelligence. Therefore, network centric collection management should be investigated to include, but not be limited to, multi-platform signal correlation and Multi-INT sensor cueing. (g) Technologies and capabilities to more fully leverage Motion Imagery (MI) information, to include, but not limited to: object tracking of both stationary and moving targets (robust enough to handle objects being obscured or leaving and returning into the sensors field of view), cross cueing capabilities across heterogeneous collections of sensors and platforms, visualization capabilities to display multiple intelligence data sources in a common geospatial reference, deriving accurate geo-positioning information, and automated event cueing to alert on specified activities or configurations. Integration of automated MI or Full Motion Video (FMV) analysis with automated analysis of other intelligence inputs. (h) Technologies and capabilities for the acquisition and storage of Human Intelligence (HUMINT) information. HUMINT provides for up-close human based observation, and is often the first and last data source for evidence collection related to an event. Although this source can be very subjective, it can also be very productive and often times the only method by which the true effects of an action can be evaluated. It is critical to examine methods of representing and storing HUMINT data without compromising the sources. (i) Advanced Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques for use in a network-centric exploitation environment. This will include new algorithms, techniques and methods for meeting the future needs in the areas of Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Audio Processing, Special Signals, Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), Steganographic Intelligence (STEGINT) and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), as well as any combination of these. Consideration should be given to "surgical" exploitation techniques for reducing data and processing requirements through intelligent collection. The development of advanced algorithms which reduce the overall sensor intake, more intelligently process the data among the available resources/nodes, and addresses security, bandwidth, and load-balancing throughout the overall system will be given consideration. The primary focus of this BAA is to have an advanced exploitation capability which effectively enables automated/Man on The Loop (MoTL) exploitation techniques; provides a framework for advanced exploitation, course of action (COA) development, correlation and cueing, and mission planning techniques developed under this BAA and elsewhere; and supports the integration of ISR, network-operations and other intelligence gathering while decreasing the demand for bandwidth in support of collection and intelligence generation.</p>

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in relation to the provision of software development and services for the NATO Intel Toolbox (NITB) to be installed on the ISAF NATO Secret and ISAF Mission Secret networks.   This procurement will provide the extensions and improvements to the NITB capability that is to be deployed to ISAF.   The contractor will perform the following:

a)  Provide a Release Server for automated, assured, and secure transfer of data between the two Security domains of NATO Secret and ISAF Secret

b) Provide Operations and Maintenance (O&M) support tools for the NITB systems

c) Improve the capability to import data from, and export data to, the Battlefield Information, Collection, and Exploitation Systems (BICES) network

d) Provide an improved documentation package for the NITB system 
 
e) Provide 1-year initial O&M support

For the Summary of Requirements, please refer to the NC3A Bulletin Board:

http://boa.nc3a.nato.int/bulletinboard.xml

The bidders list for this ICB will include firms that NC3A has pulled from its registry of vendors as well as firms that have been approved for participation in NATO ICB and nominated to the bidders list.   In response to this notice, qualified U.S. firms in addition to those already identified by NC3A will be nominated to the bidders list.

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference of the IFB is IFB-CO-12940-OPL, and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

NC3A was authorized to use the Alliance Operations and Missions (AOM) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) Procedure.  The successful bid will be that bid that is the lowest price and is technically compliant in accordance with the evaluation criteria.  NC3A plans to place a single contract for the entire scope of work.  No partial bidding will be allowed.

Bidders must have an overall personnel security and facility clearance of NATO SECRET at the time of the IFB release in order to be eligible to receive the bidding documents and to submit a bid.  Due to the classification, bidders will be required to submit the bid response material through the U.S. Mission to NATO.  

The successful contractor will be required to handle and store classified information up to the level of NATO SECRET.  Consequently, only those companies maintaining appropriate facility clearances will be eligible to bid.  In addition, contractor personnel visiting or working on operational sites will be required to hold individual security clearance of at least NATO SECRET.  

The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NC3A the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for an ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States. 

U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.  The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

Using the contact information indicated on the DOE, the NATO contracting agency will contact the firm directly when the IFB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a DOE (and, for U.S. facilities not yet approved for NATO ICB, to submit a completed NATO ICB application): 10 February 2010

2. Anticipated date that NC3A will issue the IFB: February 2010

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: end of March 2010

4. Anticipated contract award date: end of May 2010

CAUTION NOTICE

In the past, most Best Value Clothing and Textile solicitations utilized Best Value Trade Off Procedures, however, this acquisition is utilizing the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Best Value Method.  As such, no "trade off" applies and the Government intends to award to the low priced firm who is compliant with terms of the solicitation, and deemed "technically acceptable."  Also, unlike previous acquisitions for commercial items, there will be no allowable re-submittals for PDM and only firms with satisfactory or better PDMs will be eligible for award.  Technical Acceptability is being defined herein as satisfactory, very good or exceptional PDMs.  All PDMs will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria outlined in the solicitation.  

From among technically acceptable firms, the Government will then select the lowest price offeror and determine if that firm is responsible, complies with terms and conditions of the solicitation and an award to them is in the best interest of the Government.  If that firm fits these criteria, award will be made to them.  If not, the Government will review each subsequent technically acceptable low priced offer until one is identified that does meet the criteria, in which case award will be made to that firm.

The Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with a competitive range group of offerors from among technically acceptable firms, based on price.  If negotiations are conducted, award will be made to low priced offer (based on final proposal revision closing, date/time) that is technically acceptable, responsible and compliant with solicitation terms and conditions.   
 

 Solicitation will be issued as a Total Small Business Set Aside utilizing the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Best Value Method.  Successful offeror(s) will be awarded the entire contract, therefore, offeror must offer on base year and all option years.  

Availability of solicitations, FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.    Offeror should register to receive notification of this solicitation or solicitation amendments.  Copies of this solicitation can be found on the DIBBS website at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/  AFTER  February 8, 2010.  From the DIBBS homepage, select "RFP/IFBs" from the main heading toolbar.

<CONTACT>Melinda Draper 208-387-5610;Chris Kirk 208-387-5665
<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain crew carrier buses as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vipr.php.In addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:  1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer.  A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php. 2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication.   Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected.  The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR).  Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system.  Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account.  The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud.   The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website:  http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA 95131, for preventive maintenance services for the LSR II instruments. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $7.0 million. This is a firm fixed price acquisition. The period of performance is twelve months from award date. Place of performance is in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>The NINDS Viral Immunology and Intravital Imaging Unit laboratory presently utilizes a custom digital flow cytometer (LSR II) manufactured by Becton Dickinson (BD) Biosciences to analyze cell suspensions. This instrument is equipped with four (4) lasers and thirteen (13) photomultiplier tubes (or detectors) as well as other sophisticated circuitry and mechanics. It is essential that the lab&nbsp;obtains the&nbsp;maintenance services from BD Biosciences&nbsp;to keep the instrument running and to&nbsp;receive the software upgrade it needed.&nbsp; The maintenance services and software upgrade to the customized instrument LSR II can only be obtained from the manufacturer BD Biosciences which includes the following:<br />1) two preventive maintenance inspections,<br />2) Software Revisions,<br />3) Unlimited service visits, Monday - Friday,<br />4) Unlimited telephone support for instruments, reagents, and applications, at no additional charge,<br />5) Emergency onsite support.<br /><br />No other suppliers can satisfy the agency's requirement and provide the required level of support and a comprehensive understanding of the LSR II. To use services provided by&nbsp;a vendor other than BD Biosciences will jeopardize the manufacturer warranty on the instrument. &nbsp;It is therefore determined that BD Biosciences is the only qualified vendor to provide the required services.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider response submitted on or before 2:00 PM E.T., February 4, 2010 to Liem T Nguyen, ln18x@nih.gov.

ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  THERE IS NO SEPARATE RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.
NAVFAC MIDLANT is requesting A&E qualifications from interested parties for Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contracts for Architectural and Engineering Design services for projects for six (6) contracts for projects at Military Installations throughout the NAVFAC MIDLANT Area of Responsibility (AOR).  The MIDLANT AOR includes the entire mid-Atlantic and northern-Atlantic regions including, but not limited to Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware.  The preponderance of the work under these contracts is anticipated to occur within NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic Northeast IPT area of responsibility including the states of Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont.  NAVFAC intends to award up to six (6) separate, stand alone IDIQ A&E contracts, it is anticipated that the awarded contracts will reflect work within MIDLANT IPTNE geographic area and that orders will be issued against the appropriate contract vehicle for such work.  No task orders will be competed among the contracts awarded.  Contracts will be awarded not to exceed $10,000,000.
The preponderance of projects envisioned for these contracts are in the $1,000,000 to $40,000,000 range of estimated construction cost.  Projects can be categorized as Architectural and Engineering design services in nature and shall include, but are not limited to: personnel housing facilities (Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ) and Bachelor Officers' Quarters (BOQ)); office facilities; training facilities (operational, maintenance and classroom); and industrial maintenance facilities (Vehicle Maintenance Shops. Shore Intermediate Maintenance Activities, Aircraft Maintenance Hangars, Public Works Shops, Warehouses): (a) Building construction and addition of Special Projects and MILCON facilities; (b) General building renovation work, i.e., repair/replacement of roofs, windows, doors, ceilings, floors, restrooms, exterior and interior building finishes, HVAC, plumbing, lighting, power, fire protection and communications; (c) Conducting Life Safety Code Studies, interior space ! planning/design studies, (d)  Site work, paving, landscaping, structural, electrical, communications, mechanical, plumbing, fire protection, energy conservation systems, and utilities; and (e) marine facilities (harbors, jetties, piers, wharves, ship terminals, dredging).
Architectural and Engineering Design Services that may be required under this contract include, but are not limited to, facility planning which includes project programming documents (1391 development) which entails preparation of basic project documents of the DD Form 1391 in the Navy's Electronic Procurement Generator (EPG), development of requirements, preparation of engineering evaluations, project scope, and unit guidance costs or parametric cost estimating, development of alternatives and economic analysis; analysis of proposed sites for foundations, utilities, access, constraints and identification of environmental, sustainable design and anti-terrorism/force protection issues; Design-Bid-Build packages (drawings, specifications, basis of design, cost estimates, and all associated engineering services), Design-Build Request for Proposal (RFP) packages, government collateral equipment lists, USGBC LEED Checklists and Sustainable Design Reports, developing building comm! issioning requirements, project preliminary hazard analysis, obtaining permits and regulatory approvals, review of contractor submittals, field consultation and inspection during construction, Title II Inspection, Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI), and record document preparation.  The initial project(s) will be determined at a later date.
The Naval Facilities Engineering Command is presently using Design-Build as the preferred method for acquiring capital improvements.  Though Design-Bid-Build methodologies (with the preparation of 100% Plans and Specifications) will continue to be utilized, a significant number will likely require preparation of Requests for Proposal packages for Design-Build solicitations using abbreviated (0% - 30%) design documentation.  Packages would include elements of site/engineering investigation, architectural programming, and function/performance specifications.  Phases and/or pre-priced contract options may be included and will be exercised at the discretion of the government for 0 to 35%, 35 to 100% design, and post construction contract award services.  Contract award is contingent on availability of funds.  Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work; however, delays of up to one year are possible.  All projects will require design in the metric system, unless specifically exempted.  As part of this contract, an asbestos and/or lead-based paint assessment may be required to determine the presence of hazardous material during removals/demolition or at utility points of connections.  Firms must be able to accept work that involves asbestos, lead paint, PCBs, and other hazardous materials.  Work will be prepared utilizing AutoCAD 2006 or higher.  Specifications will be prepared using SPECINSTACT SGML program, and cost estimates using the Success estimating program in a Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) system format will be utilized.  Selected firm will be required to provide documents in pdf format for posting to a Government web site during solicitation.  All design and engineering services shall comply with the most current edition of UFC 1-300-09N Design Procedures, and other requirements as indicated on the Whole Building Design Guide Web Site (www.wbdg.org).
Firms are advised that the selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates which design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract. This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD Form 1391), facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or request for proposals for Design-Build projects, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost. The contract requires that the selected firm have on-line access to email via the Internet for exchange of correspondence/information.
SIGNIFICANT EVALUATION FACTORS (in order of importance):  The A&E must demonstrate their and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the following evaluation factors for all services.
1. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE. Recent experience (within the past five years) of the design team members individually and collectively as a total team (A/E, client, outside agencies) in the type of work required or evidence of similar relevant experience (as described above) and in: a) Designing and providing construction documents for various Architectural and Engineering projects (as previously described), b) experience with multi-phased design and construction programs, c) Performing facility planning studies which includes 1391 development, developing of requirements, preparing engineering evaluations, project scope, and unit guidance or parametric cost estimating.

The work includes but is not limited to:  fire suppression systems (wet, dry, pre-action, wet chemical, deluge and high speed deluge and ultra high speed deluge), water supplies (fire pumps, tanks and underground water mains), low and high expansion foam, gaseous (carbon dioxide and clean agents) special hazards protection, and fire alarm systems (detection, reporting, and mass communication) for the Department of Defense activities in the states of South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, GTMO, and the Bahamas to the extent managed by NAVFAC SE. 	The NAICS Code for this procurement is 238210 and the annual size standard of $14M dollars.  	The anticipated task order range is between $50,000 and $3,000,000 with most task orders falling in the range of $75,000 to $1,500,000. The maximum contract value is not-to-exceed (NTE) $30M dollars.  The period of performance will be for one base year with four one year option periods for a maximum of sixty months or a maximum dollar value of not-to-exceed (NTE) $30,000,000 for all contracts, whichever comes first.
	The Government will award this contract to 3 no more than 5 contractors.  The Government will give fair consideration to all awardees in placing orders based on criteria stated in the solicitation.  
Only the base period of the contract will offer a minimum guarantee.  If the Government does not award a follow-on contract in time, the Government may require the Contractor to continue performance for an additional period up to six months under the Option to Extend Services clause.  
	This contract will replace contract N62467-02-D-0439 for similar services awarded in 2003 for not to exceed $30,000,000 over a maximum five year term. Information about the current contract and the incumbent contractor (e.g., value of last option exercised, firm name, address, etc.) will be included in the solicitation package.

Large business concerns are required to submit a subcontracting plan prior to award of the contract.	The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and experience information, and a price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  Proposers will be evaluated using the two-phase request for proposal procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.
Phase 1 is the pre-qualification phase.  For Phase 1, offerors will be evaluated on the following factors: Factor 1 - Corporate Experience and Qualifications, Factor 2 - Past Performance, Factor 3 - Safety.  
In Phase 2, the selected Phase 1 offerors will submit technical and price proposals for the seed project.  All ratings from Phase 1 will be carried over into Phase 2, unless new or revised information is provided. In addition, offerors will be evaluated on the following technical factors: Factor 4 - Technical Solution Including Design Build to Budget, Factor 5 - Small Business Utilization.  Price proposals shall be submitted separately from the technical proposal.  The Government will evaluate price based on the total price.  Offerors shall submit with their offer a bid bonding capability in the amount of $3,000,000 or 20% of their total bid price for the seed project, whichever amount is less.  The best value offeror will receive a contract for the seed project.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   Combined Synopsis / Solicitation
RFQ-DC-10-00053
*THIS RFQ CAN ALSO BE FOUND AT http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/lasc/1000053/index.htm 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation (OSRTI), Technology Innovation and Field Services Division (TIFSD), Analytical Services Branch (ASB) seeks to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of performing dioxin/furans and CB congeners analytical services.
A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; instead, it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition.
PURPOSE: The purpose of the multi-media, multi-concentration dioxin/furan analytical service and the multi-media, multi-concentration chlorinated biphenyl (CB) congener analytical service is to provide analytical data for use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in support of the investigation and clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of1980 (CERCLA) and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of1986 (SARA). Other USEPA Program Offices, as well as customers outside the Agency, that have similar analytical data needs also use this service 
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: The dioxin/furan analytical service provides a contractual framework for laboratories to apply USEPA analytical methods for the isolation, detection, and quantitative measurement of 17 2,3,7,8-substituted tetra through octachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) and chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs) in water, soil, sediment, sludge, tissue (no human tissue), ash, oil, and oily matrices. The analytical service provides the methods to be used and the specific contractual requirements by which the Government will evaluate the data. This service uses a High Resolution Gas Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) method to analyze the target compounds. 
The CB congener analytical service provides a contractual framework for laboratories to apply USEPA analytical methods for the isolation, detection, and quantitative measurement of chlorinated biphenyl (CB) congeners in water, soil, sediment, sludge, tissue (no human tissue), ash, oil, and oily matrices. The analytical service provides the methods to be used and the specific contractual requirements by which USEPA will evaluate the data. This service uses a High Resolution Gas Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) method to analyze the target compounds. 
The specific task requirements are detailed in the DLM02.2 SOW and the CBC01.2 SOW, available at http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/.
The North American Industries Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380 and the size standard is $12 million.
There is no monetary value to this agreement.
Interested vendors must be registered at CCR.gov and ORCA.BPN.gov (in accordance with FAR Parts 4.11 and 4.12).
REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS AND EVALUATION: All responsible sources may submit the required documents listed below, in writing, to the identified point of contact below by the response date. Documentation may be submitted electronically to the point of contact, or may be mailed via U.S. Postal Service to: U.S. EPA Ariel Rios Building, Attn: Wendy Rizzo, Mail Code 3805R, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20460; or, via commercial delivery or courier service to: U.S. EPA Ronald Reagan Building, Attn: Wendy Rizzo, Mail Code 3805R, Room 61174, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20004.

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Systems Agency is interested in developing system architectures for DSA networks through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, in accordance with FAR 35.016. The following information is for those wishing to respond to the BAA.</p>
<p>Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) has emerged in recent years as a capability that has the potential to effectively address spectrum access challenges by allowing dynamic, flexible, and autonomous spectrum access. DSA is realized through wireless networking architectures and technologies that enable wireless devices to dynamically adapt their spectrum access according to criteria such as policy constraints, spectrum availability, propagation environment, and application performance requirements. Fundamental changes are required in the way the DoD obtains and utilizes its spectrum resources to address increased spectrum demand and DSA technologies.</p>
<p>DISA/DSO is seeking sources that are familiar with recent advances in DSA technologies and capable of performing analytical spectrum studies of DSA networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please see attached BAA-DSO-10-01 for details.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement. <br />
<p><br />Background. The CNS HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study was awarded in September 2002, under contract N01MH22005, to the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) to examine the presentation and predictors of neurologic complications of HIV in the era of combination antiretroviral treatment (ART). In performance of this contract, UCSD has examined 1,574 participants cross-sectionally, 657 participants longitudinally, and is continuing to follow additional subjects through the contract expiration date in August 2010.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The data collected to date has helped advance the knowledge of the pathophysiology of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND), and a continuation of this research is required.</p>
<p>The goal of the follow-on research is to continue assessment of subsets of the longitudinal patient cohort studied under this contract. This will provide detailed answers to key follow-up questions based on the preliminary findings. The proposed program may help to identify the biomarkers that annotate disease progression and address key questions relevant to the persistence of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) and inform therapy.</p>
<p>Project Requirements. The key issues to be explored include:</p>
<p>1) whether low-level HIV replication in the cerebral spinal fluid is a predictor of HAND;<br />2) whether HAND will be present in the CHARTER cohort who experienced failure of antiretroviral therapy to control HIV replication in the cerebral spinal fluid, (HAND will be assessed by annual neurocognitive and brain imaging); <br />3) assessment of the predictors of neurological injury by examining cases that are receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and undergoing cognitive decline or increasing white matter abnormality. Drug resistance profiles, in CSF and Plasma of those cases with neurocognitive decline and increasing white matter abnormality, will be examined to determine the contribution of evolution of viral strains with discordant resistance. evaluation of skin biopsy variables may be required as they are related to key disease and treatment parameters to define the extent to which nerve injury is reversible or irreversible in the context of ART treatment.</p>
<p>Other Important Considerations. In order to perform this work, qualified sources shall have: <br /><br />1) access via informed consent to a cohort of 180 well-characterized, longitudinally studied patients under contract N01MH22005, who have been followed by the University of California at San Diego and at 5 other sites (sub-awards);</p>
<p>2) experience in performing multi-site clinical studies and experience/expertise in neurocognitive and neurological assessments, neuroimaging, virology and genetics.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance. The resulting contract has an anticipated period of performance of 5 years.</p>
<p>Capability Statement. Any business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (5-10 pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the described work. Capability Statements should describe (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information (f) any other resources available to support this project.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding availability and capability from qualified small business organizations to provide the services stated herein. Based on capability statements received in response to this Sources Sought Announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside. All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice. 

Background. The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) last conducted a formal and very successful strategic planning process in 2007-2008, resulting in a strategic plan for 2008-2012. Although that plan added addressed research training and career development, the Institute recognizes that additional efforts are needed to articulate a clear, multi-year approach and strategy to ensure that future NIGMS-supported training best reflect the scientific and workforce needs and contributes to the development of a strong and diverse biomedical research workforce. It is therefore imperative that NIGMS undergo a formal planning process at this time.

Purpose and Objectives of Strategic Planning Project. NIGMS will develop a long-term research training and career development strategic plan to provide focus, guidance, and direction for its programs. The process is directed by a steering committee of senior NIGMS staff, chaired by the Director of the Division of Genetics and Development Biology, and operates in close consultation with the NIGMS Director, who personally conceived and initiated the overall effort, and has stated that its completion is an NIGMS priority. Of principal importance is the development of a plan that sustains the leadership of the Institute in support of biomedical research training and career development to assure a well-trained biomedical workforce that will enable the U.S. to maintain its pre-eminence both in academia and in biomedically related industries. It is anticipated that input in various forms from the broad community of stakeholders  academic and industry investigators, graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, leadership from across NIH, the NIGMS Advisory Council, and others will contribute significantly to the development of this strategic plan.

Project Requirements. Qualified sources will be required to assume responsibility for the following on-and off-site tasks in support of the NIGMS research training and career development strategic planning process: 1) Background review of all NIGMS training programs, initiatives, and related information; 2) Review of relevant reports and analyses of training approaches, trends, and workforce needs; 3) Development of recommendations on overall process design, timing, key components, and emphasis; 4) Assistance with the development of a survey, to be posted by NIGMS on the Institutes Web site, designed to elicit broad public input from its stakeholder community; 5) Guidance in organizing several stakeholder meetings in different geographical locations in the U.S. to obtain input on desired outcomes of NIGMS-sponsored research training and career development programs; 6) Development of draft agendas for all strategic planning-related meetings; 7) On-site facilitation/moderation of key meetings and/or work sessions; 8) Development of other key documents to support the process, including outlines, discussion papers, and process recommendations; 9) Attendance and participation at all meetings of the strategic plan committee and other meetings where key planning issues or topics are addressed; 10) Assistance in interpreting input from key constituencies in order to develop NIGMS priorities; 11) Providing advice and counsel to the strategic plan committee, its chair, and the NIGMS Director on all matters related to the development of the strategic plan. 

Anticipated Period of Performance will cover 14 months.

Any business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the described work. Capability Statements should described (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information and (f) any other resources available to support this project.

<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: Department of the Air Force, Air Combat Command, 633D Contracting Squadron/LGCA proposes to acquire the items described below with a "Justification for other than Full and Open Competition".</p>

<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISTION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the following conditions preclude competitive full and open competition procurement. Beckman Coulter, as owner and manufacturer, is the only company that can provide all software and maintenance services. Beckman Coulter software is unique hardware that no other vendor can offer or support. Beckman Coulter is the sole domestic source for the purchase of software and parts.

DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE: The Contracting Officer will determine the acquisition cost to be fair and reasonable after receipt and evaluation of the contractor's quote/proposal. A base used as the manufacturer of required equipment before resell markup, and reasonable quantity discounts have been applied the anticipated costs will be considered fair and reasonable. After review of previous history for the same or similar service the cost is determined to be less than one percent of the previous year's cost and therefore found that $11500.00 is at this time fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKER RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF HE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NPT CONDUCTED: Market research was accomplished by posting on FedBizOpps on 18 December 2009 and no one responded.

<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISTION: The requirement was posted on FedBizOpps for other sources to express interest in this requirement. No one responded.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED: At the present time, there are no competitive sources that can meet the government's minimal acceptable needs for this requirement. All the appropriate steps to foster competition were used and no other company could fill the requirements. The Government will continue its market research for future like requirements.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION: The Contracting Officer's signature on the Justification Review Document is evidence that the Contracting Officer has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief.</p>

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The Government is investigating the availability of innovative technology which will be able to aid in replicating capability or transferring services from the space layer to the aerial layer during an interruption or degradation of space-based services. Of specific interest is technology which could aid in restoring precision Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capability (such as that provided by uncontested GPS services), as well as rerouting or mitigating the loss of space-based communications to on-going operations during an interruption or degradation.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>The primary intent of this RFI is to explore mature innovative technologies and concepts for shifting and sustaining services from space when confronted with degradation or disruption of space services that assure command and control (C2) and mission capability and effectiveness. The technology sought is expected to be part of a system that will consist of any necessary sensor devices, communications and processing hardware/software. The technology is expected to utilize a modular open standards approach. Submissions should address the information transportation mechanism (e.g. waveforms and radios) useful in this environment, connectivity of different waveforms and, of special interests, the ability to manage and secure the network and information to ensure mission capability and success.</p>
<p>3.1 Focus areas include but are not limited to the examples listed below:</p>
<p>3.1.1 Technology which could build upon or replace proven cross-domain networking technologies that will facilitate dynamic network service prioritization and optimization to allow operators to effectively plan, coordinate, allocate, deploy and monitor an integrated set of terrestrial, airborne and space communication layer services.<br /><br />3.1.2 Potential workarounds in a planning or dynamic scenario to maintain communications.</p>
<p>3.1.3 Technology capable of providing PNT data, such as GPS ephemeris and User Ranging Error data via Link 16 for degraded GPS scenarios.</p>
<p>3.1.4 Augmentation of the GPS-derived navigation solution through a communication link to enhance the precision and robustness of the positioning information.</p>
<p>3.1.5 Network-based navigation to supplement GPS or provide PNT data in an environment where GPS is not available.</p>
<p>3.1.6 Initiatives which integrate multi-sensor user equipment as a complementary means of providing PNT to the Warfighter.</p>
<p>3.1.7 Situational awareness capabilities which improve the understanding, trade-offs, and reconfiguration options of work around scenarios or capabilities.</p>
<p>4.0 Responses</p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>4.2 White papers in Microsoft Word for Office format (version 2000 or newer), 8.5 X 11 inch pages, formatted in two sections described below are due no later than 15 February 2010.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Technology, Systems & Program Integration Directorate (TSPID) at the Natick Soldier Research, Development, & Engineering Center, intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Harris Corporation, RF Communications Division, Rochester, NY 14610.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The AN/PRC-117G(V)1(C) radio assembly is a multiband, man-packable radio with GPS capabilities. The SNPLI team is also requesting supporting hardware that consists of Ethernet (J3) cable assemblies for loading and downloading pertinent data, Falcon III dismount kits and a battery eliminator for these radios.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Harris Corporation, RF Communications Division is the only manufacturer and reseller of the AN/PRC-117G(V)1(C) radio and compatible accessories. This AN/PRC-117G is a fielded item and no other substitute is available. The ANW2 operational mode is specific to this unit and is unavailable from other variants of the AN/PRC-117. <BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>The AN/PRC-117G(V)1(C) radio with the ANW2 operational mode is the only man-packable radio that is compatible with the developmental soldier systems that the SNPLI team has developed.

<DESC>DARPA-SN-10-24<br />TRITON PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will host a classified Proposers' Day Workshop for the Tactical Relay InformaTiOn Network (TRITON) program on February 9, 2010 from 0730 to 1700 in San Diego, CA at the Admiral Kidd Conference Center in the Skyline Room located at the Naval Mine and Anti-Submarine Warfare Command at 1700 Harbor Drive, Point Loma, San Diego, CA 92113, in support of DARPA-BAA-10-25, (expected to be released prior to the Conference). The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the TRITON Submarine Laser Communications (SLC) program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: DARPA anticipates releasing the BAA for the Tactical Relay Information Network program with the overall objective to provide a field quality, Technology Readiness Level-6 (TRL-6) submarine laser communication system that operates in the blue spectrum for evaluation in a naval exercise such as the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) in fiscal year 2012. The intent is to validate the significant improvement blue laser technology brings to SLC at speed and depth; specifically, in meeting, or exceeding, the Navy's specified downlink communication requirements for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operations. This effort will leverage a number of the previously demonstrated SLC technologies, including Cesium Atomic Line Filters, solid-state lasers (SSLs) and forward error correction coding. <br /><br />REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Participants must register NLT February 4, 2010 by sending an email to DARPA-BAA-10-25@darpa.mil with the subject "TRITON Proposers' Day Registration".

<DESC>Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD), 12300 Dakota Avenue, Lakewood, Colorado intends to issue a sole source award to Chevo Studios, 3222 Tejon Street, Denver, Colorado to provide the following services: 

CFLHD has recently awarded a contract for a project (AZ PRA GRCA 12(7)) to provide improvements to the Canyon View Information Plaza and Mather Point Overlook at Grand Canyon National Park.  Part of this project is construction of an amphitheater, landmark feature, and pathway improvements at the Mather Point Overlook in the Park.    

The work requires a company with prior involvement with the tribes, a proven history of creating large-scale engineered stone features, and a track record of exceptional craftsmanship and decision making in the field.  These elements are integral to the success of the new interpretive features. They will need to be tailored to the site and adjusted / refined during the construction phase. In particular, the use of natural stone boulders requires ongoing artistic and structural decision-making on site. An exceptional degree of experience, collaboration, and coordination is required to ensure that the finished stone works are constructed in a manner that makes them both aesthetically pleasing and structurally sound. In addition, all elements must be matched to the site and intended interpretive content and experiences. 

The task being considered would include design, location, detailing, fabrication and installation of specific features along the entry points from parking lots, along the path to the landmark feature, the creation of the sculptural stone elements at the visitor center plaza, landmark feature, amphitheater and pathway improvements at Mather Point Overlook. 

The installation phase will include field locating and etching of images in stone and concrete, specialized fabrication and installation of sculptural metal elements, selection and setting of feature stones, coordination with engineers on structural solutions for setting large and irregular shaped feature boulders, and ongoing problem solving and adjustments in field, based on evolving site conditions that arise once demolition and site preparation commence.

The Government intends to procure from only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This will be a commercial acquisition using simplified acquisition procedures per FAR Part 13.  This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement to the Contract Specialist by 4:00PM MST, Monday, February 1, 2010.  These statements of interest may be submitted by email to: john.hunt@dot.gov.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 5.203 (2) the U.S. Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-912) intends to solicit and negotiate with only one responsible source, Capital Project Management, Incorporated (CPMI) 1777 Sentry Parkway W., Abington Hall Suite 100; Blue Bell, PA 19422-2210, under the authority of FAR 6.302. This will be a one year base award with four 1-year options for Claims and Litigation support. The period of Performance is February 1, 2010 to January 29, 2015. The justification is as follows: The contract delivery schedule is driven by external sources and failure to produce accurate and timely responses would result in a failure of effort for DHS IG and DOJ to meet case development and prosecution timelines set by law. The Government has determined that a new company would have to engage in a substantial duplication of effort to become conversant on this program and this learning curve would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the government. The estimate for this duplication cost is approximately $1.8 million. <br />All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing via e-mail to: Andrew Price-Gibson - Andrew.Price-Gibson@uscg.mil by January 23, 2010 Telephone inquires will not be accepted. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. <br />

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

The approach includes strengths which significantly outweigh the weaknesses.  The risk of unsuccessful performance is at least moderate, as the proposal solutions are feasible and practical.  These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirement. <BR><BR>Unacceptable- The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives.  This approach has numerous weaknesses which outweigh the strengths.  The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical.  The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirement.<BR><BR>Factor 2 Past Performance- The offeror will submit past performance of 3 current or previous contracts for relevancy (within the last 3 years) based on how well the contractor performed on projects of similar dollars value, scope and complexity.

At times, even when rehabilitative therapy is not necessary after the resident's hospital stay, AFRH-W may not have any beds available for their return. Therefore, AFRH-W has the need to send that resident to an off-site nursing home facility until a bed becomes available.<br /><br />Interested offerors may register at <a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov">http://www.fedbizopps.gov</a> to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading.

<DESC>It is the National Energy Technology Laboratory's intent to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to PureWorks, Inc., dba PureSafety,  to upgrade an existing OHM database.   An upgrade to the new web version of the OHM database is necessary to meet the needs of the NETL Occupational Health Units.  Support for the non-web version of the OHM database will no longer be available.  It is more cost effective and efficient to maintain the current database in its upgraded form than it would be to institute a new database.  The medical staff is already familiar with how the OHM database operates and the current information in the database can be easily transferred to the upgraded version.  No other software will satisfy NETL requirements.  PureSafety (formerly Unique Software Solutions) is the only company that sells this OHM product and support services.
This is not a formal solicitation.  This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.</p>
<p><br />1352.215-73 INQUIRIES (MAR 2000)<br />Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the Contracting Officer. They must be received no later than seven (7) calendar days after the date of this solicitation. All responses to the questions will be made in writing and included in an amendment to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519, with the exception provided for Information Technology Value Added Resellers. The Non-Manufacturer Rule does not apply to this requirement because it is for services, not commercial items. FAR 52.219-14 - Limitations on Subcontracting Clause does not apply to this acquisition either because the estimated value is less than $100,000. This renewal will be conducted as a small business set aside. This requirement is being competed as small business set aside whereby CheckPoint-authorized resellers/business partners will be the potential offeror base. All offerors must meet the small business size standard for the NAICS code 541519 with the exception&nbsp;provided&nbsp;for&nbsp;Information Technology Value-Added Resellers, which is 150 employees.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including the following fill-ins: 52.219-6, 52.219-28; 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) requires the renewal of the maintenance and support for existing CheckPoint Software Gateways as part of the remote access infrastructure at NIST. CheckPoint has a number of small business authorized resellers/business partners capable of renewing the maintenance and support for these gateways. This requirement consists of the following items. Quotations should be tailored to the exact items listed below.</p>
<p>CLIN 0001<br />Part Number: CPES-SS-STANDARD<br />Direct Enterprise Support for Software Gateways<br />User Center # 6481603<br />NIST Co-Term Maintenance: March 1, 2010 to November 1, 2010<br />Quantity: 1; Unit: Each</p>
<p>CLIN 0002<br />Part Number: CPES-SS-STANDARD<br />Direct Enterprise Support for Software Gateways<br />User Center # 6492738<br />NIST Co-Term Maintenance: March 1, 2010 to March 1, 2011<br />Quantity: 1; Unit: Each</p>
<p>CLIN 0003<br />Part Number: CPES-SS-STANDARD<br />Direct Enterprise Support for Software Gateways<br />User Center # 5814240<br />NIST Co-Term Maintenance: March 1, 2010 to May 1, 2010<br />Quantity: 1; Unit: Each</p>
<p><br />BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />This is a brand name requirement for CheckPoint software maintenance and technical support for the existing firewall and remote access infrastructure at NIST. The NIST firewall and remote access infrastructure is based on CheckPoint and Nokia products (CheckPoint recently acquired the Nokia security appliance business). The infrastructure consists of strategically-placed Nokia devices running the CheckPoint firewall application, CheckPoint management devices, and other devices supporting the CheckPoint firewall management components. The firewall and remote access services are considered moderately available at NIST; therefore, firewall appliances are deployed at both NIST campuses with standby appliances at each site as is necessary for redundancy. This infrastructure is already in place at NIST and to acquire an infrastructure consisting of products from a different brand name would prove to be too costly and time-consuming. CheckPoint software maintenance and technical support are available through manufacturer-authorized resellers/business partners.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because this is a requirement for maintenance and support services.</p>
<p>All responsible offerors that are considered small businesses under the NAICS code 541519 with the exception of Information Technology Value-Added Resellers, and are CheckPoint-authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br />(a) Submission of quotations.

2.  Tree Planting: Hardwood seedlings will be machine planted or hand planted on a 10 X 10 spacing (436 trees per acre) on approximately 284 acres.  The planting for the area, except for strips around water impoundments, will consist of one mix described in the Tree Planting Plan attachment to this solicitation. 

3.  Species:  Refer to the attached Tree Planting Specifications.  The contractor is responsible for the ordering of the seedlings, their delivery to the site, their care, and, if necessary, cold storage.

Each referred species will make up no more than 30% of the total mix, and secondary species will make up no more than 10% of the mix.  In addition, a separate mix will be used for the strips planted around impoundments.  In these strips at least two species from the list in the Tree Planting Specification will be 	used. 
	
4.  Species Substitution:  If a substitution is necessary due to the unavailability of a species from the nursery, low counts in the bags, modifications of the planting plan due to unforeseen conditions, etc., a species will be selected that has an equal or greater tolerance to wetness than the originally selected one.  Contractor must acquire approval from the NRCS for any species substitution.  
	
5.  Spacing and Planting Rate:  Hardwood will be planted on a 10 X 10 spacing (436 seedlings per acre). The number of satisfactory planted seedlings must fall within 15% of this planting rate or 370 seedlings per acre.

In these areas, spacing will be increase to 15 X 15.  
	
6.  Species Mixes:  Mixes will be achieved through bag-mixes and/or matching the species to the site.  	Unless otherwise specified in the Tree Planting Plan, row or block plantings of single mixes will be avoided.  Further explanation will be provided at the Pre-Planting Conference. 

7. Seedling Quality:  Seedlings will meet the standards listed in the Tree Planting Specifications.  Both the contractor and the NRCS will determine quality and count by opening one bag of each species being planted.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract.

Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers.

Q- Will the contractor be responsible for running low voltage wire through walls of the HDI Federal Center, or shall GSA complete such wiring.

A- Yes the contractor is responsible for running the wire for the complete project, however, in the SOW it states that, All work shall be completed and performed in accordance with the best practices of the trade and in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local codes. Essentially this means that any wiring ran must conform to the requirements GSA has established for the building. Further, I want to reiterate that the SOW claims the Government has reserved the right to inspect and verify that the work is in compliance with federal, state, and local these local codes.  If for some reason you think these local codes/ requirements may potentially influence a response to this announcement, then I recommend obtaining these codes/ technical requirements on local cable and wiring code/ regulations from James Buehner, the Governments Technical Representative for this announcement.

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered substantially transformed based solely on its integration into IT or other systems.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>Electronic prescribing software that integrates the services in the three areas of electronic prescribing: prescription benefit, prescription history, and information regarding new and refill prescription routing to include not only retail pharmacies, but also mail order pharmacies which are overwhelmingly used by Department of State prescribers and patients overseas. This software will integrate Deparment overseas providers with electronic access to the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) designated by the health insurer utilized by the FS employee. Use of e-prescribing software will relieve the health care staff from mailing or faxing the prescription to the appropriate pharmacy benefit manager. In addition, overseas providers will be able to access the past three years of prescribing history for each patient. The verification of eligibility requirement is critical to ensure that FS employees and dependants are not denied coverage or are delayed from obtaining the medication if the prescription is sent to wrong pharmacy benefit manager. It should also be noted that e-prescribing has the proven benefits of reducing medication errors, improving clinical efficiency, and reducing overall healthcare costs. It is an integral component of the present initiative to overhaul and improve the US healthcare system. The statutory authority permitting other than full and pen competition is 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Office of Medical Services has used RxNT for the past three years and has found the software extremely user friendly; it provides all functionality that we require. RxNT also provides critical application support on a 24x7 basis. RxNT offers functionality in all three areas as evaluated by SureScripts. Surescripts is the independant organization that evaluates e-prescribing software as to its functionality in meeting the three required areas of integration, its commitment to e-prescribing, and whether the company is committed to improving their product by developing new approaches to e-prescribing. The commitment to improving the electronic prescribing system is critical to the Office of Medical Services, as we are not sure at this point that our future Electronic Health Record System will have the capability of transmitting prescriptions outside of the EHR. RxNT presentlly enljoys the heighest evaluation ranking by Surescripts, that of "Platinum", and is only one of two systems to enjoy that ranking.<BR><BR>

Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? 

3) Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement. Present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made. 

4) Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements. 

NOTE: Proposals will not be accepted after the due date stated on Page One (1).

7. EVALUATION CRITERIA 

The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement. 

7.1 EVALUATION CRITERIA

The primary evaluation criteria are: 

a) Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and

b) The offerors capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research investigators/personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; and

c) The realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing. 

d) The proximity of the institution to NAWCAD necessary to allow use and access to the facilities at both the NAWC and the institution while minimizing cost in time and travel.7. AWARDS

NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated in Section 3 and 4. All awards will be based on merit competition. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the contracting officer, and the total exceeds $550,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with the FAR.

<p>-- After determining that a complete and acceptable proposal has been received in accordance with the requirements documented in 52.212-1, offers shall initially be ranked according to price, as identified under the Description of requirement above. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified by the proposed unit price for each Item to confirm the extended amount. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>

If the offeror is a company proposing a staffing relationship, resumes and transcripts for any/all employees intended to fill the position are required.</p>
<p>By submission of an offer, the offeror accedes to these terms. Award will be made without discussions - contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing with their response. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and a technical standpoint. Failure of an offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>Once determinations are made regarding technical acceptability of proposals, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror who submitted a proposal rated technically acceptable. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding<br />contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security

<DESC>The Central Support Contracting Division (ASC/PKEIE, 2275 D Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7228) intends to modify the existing Air Force Knowledge Now (AFKN) contract, FA8604-04-F-3139, to extend the period of performance.  This bridging modification will change the contract completion date from 29 Jan 2010 to 30 Mar 2010 with options for two (2) one-month periods of performance and increase the maximum ceiling by $1,800,000.00 in order to continue AFKN program support until Solicitation FA8604-08-R-7043 is competitively awarded.
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The proposed contract action is for work which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A&B), "Only One Responsible Source".  Contract FA8604-04-F-3139 was competitively awarded to Triune Group in July 2004.  AFKN is the Air Force's standard enterprise-wide Knowledge Management (KM) system providing mission critical support to over 350,000 war-fighters and the AF mission including mission critical support to deployed airmen.  Therefore, this contract action will allow for the continued support of mission critical functions until a follow-on contract is awarded.
Triune Group is currently the incumbent for the AFKN support contract.  AFKN is the official collaboration tool of the Air Force and was designated as the Air Force Center of Excellence for KM.  AFKN focuses on knowledge sharing and collaboration through Communities of Practice (CoP) and is available through the Air Force Portal, NIPRNet, and SIPRNet.  Triune Group, as the developer and maintainer of AFKN, has superior support knowledge of the system, and thus, is the only contractor capable of providing the support described above without the Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays in accomplishing its mission.  To enhance competition, the follow-on contract will provide a transition period if a new contractor is competitively selected, which will mitigate program risks.  See Note 22.
The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offeror(s) or potential offeror(s). The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact.  The Ombudsman is Howard E. Marks Jr., Chief, Acquisition Center of Excellence, Aeronautical Systems Center, 1755 11th St, Bldg 570, Room 101, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7404. howard.marks@wpafb.af.mil.

Foley U.S. Federal Courthouse in Spokane, Washington. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.</p>
<p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is a modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Thomas S. Foley Courthouse into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, and lighting) and will also include an expansion and relocation of the United States Marshals Services (USMS) to the second floor of the building. LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards, and United States Marshal Services (USMS) tenant standards/requirements.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/30/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/29/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

The initial task order was competitively awarded to Systems Research and Applications Corporation, 4350 Fair Lakes Court, Fairfax, VA under the Department of State's Security Assurance Services and Innovation (SASI) Blanket Purchase Agreements.  Modification M02 adds new Functional Task Area 3 to assist the Privacy Division (PRV) to develop new policies, training, and awareness communications that support the Department-wide deployment of data loss prevention (DLP).  The Privacy Division, in a collaborative effort with the Bureau of Information Resource Management and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security will draw on American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) cyber security funds for Department-wide DLP capability.  The DLP will result in a depth of monitoring of user-generated information.  With the availability of ARRA funds, these services are added to the task order; however, the ceiling was increased by $174,000 to accommodate the work.  The new FTA is being performed on a firm fixed price basis and is separate from the other work of the task order for accountability and reporting purposes under the Act.  The performace of FTA3 began upon execution of the modification and will continue through May 27, 2010.  The primary place(s) of performance are the Department of State locations in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (Main State and State Annex 2).

--Workplace monitoring;
--Privacy for the new form of monitoring;
--Targeted surveillance of a specific employee's use of IT resources based on evidence assembled using data loss prevention.

The contractor shall be required to prepare department notices describing the new monitoring to the Department of State. The contractor will initiate or further devleop, as required, program management and communications plans, schedules, budgets and performance measures. These activities will help to accomplish Bureau of Administration and Bureau of Information Resource Management goals in alignment with the Department strategic and tactical plans as appropriate.

THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D MAINTENANCE SERVICES, W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all five of these recreation areas.  2)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  3)  This contract enables installation to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>Justification and Approval
For Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Activity

Naval Medical Logistics Command, Acquisition Management Directorate, Code02, 693 Neiman Street Fort Detrick, MD 21702-9203
a.Requesting Activity: Naval Medical Research Center, Admin Directorate/Contracting Division, 503 Robert Grant Avenue, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA
b.Document Number: N3239809RCCH023
c.Shipped To: 503 Robert Grant Avenue, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA

2.Description of Action: Approval is requested to support the mission of the Military Infectious Diseases Research Program Area L- Diagnostic Systems for Infectious Disease by developing a Reverse Transcriptase Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for dengue virus detection on the basis of other than full and open competition.  

3. Description of Supplies/Services:
Contractor responsibilities include:
a.Optimize prototype RT-LAMP assay using replaced reagents
ii.Obtain prototype RT-LAMP assay and stock dengue RNA extracts from NMRC
iii.Replace the dTTP in the reaction with a mixture of Biotin-11-dUTP, digoxigenin-11-dUTP, and dTTP
iv.Perform and optimize the RT-LAMP reaction using stock dengue RNA extracts so that the biotin and digoxigenin will be incorporated into the nucleic acid reaction products
b.Transitioning the optimized RT-LAMP assay developed by NMRC into an Immunochromatographic (ICT) strip format including:
ii.Capture the biotin and digoxigenin-containing RT-LAMP products on the ICT strips to be visualized by the naked eye
iii.Manufacture ICT assays using Contractor SOPs
c.Evaluate the prototype ICT assay using patient RNA extracts to obtain clinical sensitivity, specificity, and cross reactivity for other flaviviruses.
ii.Obtain patient RNA extracts from NMRC
iii.Perform preliminary evaluation using patient RNA to obtain clinical sensitivity, specificity, and cross reactivity for other flaviviruses
iv.Troubleshoot to meet performance standards

4.  Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: The authority cited is 10.U.S.C. 2304  (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.

5.  Rational Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority:  No other contractor provides successful transition of the prototype dengue RT-LAMP diagnostic assays to an ICT strip format to make the dengue diagnostic easier to read and interpret in a field setting.  The process for transitioning and evaluating the ICT assay involves multiple steps: optimizing the ICT assay, incorporating the labeling proteins, striping ICT strips, performing specificity analyses with patient serum samples. National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan has successfully produced the prototype ICT, and in their preliminary testing, it shows that the prototype ICT can detect the nucleic acid amplification products. The contractor has successfully manufactured ICT strips that contain a nano-gold streptavidin conjugate and a line of anti-digoxigenin to capture amplification products. 
6.  Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offers Practicable:  Market research was conducted and found that only one responsible source will meet the governments need.  A notice of intent will be posted in order to locate more potential sources.

7.  Determine of Fair and Reasonable Cost:  The Contracting Officer will determine that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable prior to award. 

8.  Action to Remove Barriers to Future Competition:  A notice of intent to sole source will be posted to FBO.gov in accordance with FAR 5.201.

9.  Interested Sources:  Please see 6.
          
10. Other Facts  
a.  Procurement history: 
i.  Contract numbers and dates of the last several awards: N/A
ii. Competitive status of these actions: 
b. Acquisition Data Availability:  
c. Unusual and Compelling Urgency: N/A
