<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE ORDER AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and issue an order with Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA 92823 under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b). This request is for the purchase of the following: one (1) each - B43905 Multisizer 4e System which includes B23005 Multisizer 4e Instrument with 100 &micro;m Aperture Tube, 8546719 Isoton II Diluent, 8546930 Coulter Clenz, 6602798 L20 Standard, nominal 20 &micro;m, 6602796 L 10 Standard, and A35473 Accuvette, 200 vials &amp; caps; one (1) each B00262 Computer and Monitor which includes A88098 20.1" Matrix LC Display with USB . Cable and A88079 Intel Computer, Win 7 Operating System; and one (1) each B531425 Spigot Assembly. System includes on-site installation and training by factory Service Engineer. The laboratory requires the capability to accurately and reproducibly count the number of bacterial particles (dead and alive) in bacterial cultures that had been generated in the laboratory. In addition, it is necessary to determine the size of the particles as well as the size distributions. This requirement is fully met by the Beckman Multisizer 4e instrument. Cell counts and size distributions were clearly revealed, as well as differences in average cell size between two different strains of interest. This instrument also allows the capability to inject undiluted cultures in the machine so that the system is useful for investigating early stages of bacterial growth when cell densities are still very low. The Beckman Multisizer 4e instrument has an optimal size range, depending on the cuvette used, of 0.6 to 18 micrometers. This optimally fits the size range of our bacteria (1-2 micron and above). Award is subject to approval of the Sole Source Justification. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations; however, an interested party may submit a statement of capabilities if they believe they can meet the above requirement. The statement of capabilities must be submitted in writing and contain sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can provide the requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<RESPDATE>092316
<CONTACT>Samantha L. Connors, Email samantha.l.connors.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.
<p>This notice is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, particularly small businesses, prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a solicitation.</p>
<p>USAMRAA (on behalf of USAMRIID) is seeking firms capable of providing toxic and nontoxic O. ovata and Alexandrium tamarensis culture extracts and, if necessary, additional toxic zooanthid extracts. Additionally, the contractor will be expected to provide technical guidance on palytoxin and its physiological effects on the animal models, saxitoxin dosing, and response analysis throughout the project. <br />These support services may include:<br />Extracts of toxic Ostreopsis ovata culture (WHOI)<br />Extracts of nontoxic O. ovata culture (WHOI, as negative control)<br />a) Maintain multiple toxic and non-toxic cultures of Ostreopsis ovata in laboratory cultures, with appropriate backups so that the strains are not lost. The culture facility must also have emergency power. Toxic strains must include NIES-3351 (s0752), and NIES-3353 (s0587).</p>
<p>b) Grow, on a continuous basis throughout the project, 1-L batch cultures of Ostreopsis ovata in multiple 2.8 liter flasks, as well as in 17-liter volumes in 20-liter glass carboys, depending upon the rate at which biomass is needed for experiments. Growth rates should meet or exceed 0.25 divisions per day. Explore the use of semi-continuous cultures as a method to provide more biomass over time. Monitor the cell yield of all cultures through time, so each can be harvested at the time of optimal toxin production. Laboratory space and culture facilities must have appropriate safety precautions given the potent nature of palytoxin and the need to eliminate aerosol exposure. Demonstrate competence in maintaining dinoflagellate cultures over long intervals, and an ability to grow large volumes of toxic species on a safe and continuous basis.</p>
<p>c) Harvest cultures on a continuous basis, freeze cell pellets, and send frozen pellets to project partners at USAMRID and FDA as needed. Pellets are to be stored at -80oC until shipment.</p>
<p>d) Provide technical guidance on palytoxin and its physiological effects on the animal models throughout the project. Assist in planning all experiments, in analysis of results, and in publication of project findings. Travel to USAMRID for project meetings as needed.</p>
<p>Extracts of toxic Alexandrium fundyense cultures (WHOI)<br />Extracts of nontoxic Alexandrium fundyense culture (WHOI, as negative control)<br />Extracts of shellfish containing a suite of saxitoxin congeners</p>
<p>a) Maintain multiple toxic and non-toxic cultures of Alexandrium fundyense in laboratory cultures, with appropriate backups so that the strains are not lost. The culture facility must also have emergency power. Toxic strains must include those that produce the most toxic of the saxitoxin congeners.</p>
<p>b) Grow, on a continuous basis throughout the first year of the project, 1-L batch cultures of A. fundyense in multiple 2.8 liter flasks, as well as in 17-liter volumes in 20-liter glass carboys, depending upon the rate at which biomass is needed for experiments. Growth rates should meet or exceed 0.25 divisions per day. Monitor the cell yield of all cultures through time, so each can be harvested at the time of optimal toxin production. Demonstrate competence in maintaining dinoflagellate cultures over long intervals, and an ability to grow large volumes of toxic species on a safe and continuous basis.</p>
<p>c) Harvest cultures on a continuous basis, extract pellets, analyze with HPLC, and send extracts to project partners at USAMRID as needed. Extracts are to be stored at -20oC until shipment. HPLC analysis will be conducted to characterize the toxin composition profile (i.e., the concentration and relative abundance) of all saxitoxin congeners present.</p>
<p>d) Obtain toxic shellfish and extract toxins. Characterize total toxicity and toxin composition profile using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).</p>
<p>e) Measure toxin composition profile in mouse blood after exposure experiments using HPLC.</p>
<p>f) Provide technical guidance on saxitoxin dosing and response analysis throughout the project. Assist in planning all experiments, in analysis of results, and in publication of project findings. Travel to USAMRID for project meetings as needed.</p>
<p>These cultures are an integral part required to start a research project and the initial shipment will be expected within the first quarter of FY17. Any interested parties MUST be able to meet this schedule requirement.</p>
<p>Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Notice, the Government will determine the most appropriate acquisition strategy for this requirement. All interested parties are requested to submit a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length) to the contracting office. These packages must demonstrate each party's ability to perform the required services, as well as its prior experience with similar requirements.<br />Responses are due on Friday September 23, 2016 by 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</p>
<p>The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice.</p>
<p>Capabilities statements must be submitted electronically to SAMANTHA.L.CONNORS.CIV@MAIL.MIL.<br />Questions regarding this notice should be addressed to Samantha L. Connors via email at SAMANTHA.L.CONNORS.CIV@MAIL.MIL.</p>

BACKGROUND - It is the policy of the Department to provide its employees, and family members, access to an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to offer resources to address: work-related problems, traumatic incidents, substance abuse, mental illness, marital or family problems, and financial or other personal problems. EAP is a comprehensive program that can provide employees with the support, tools, and resources they need to manage through difficult times and remain productive on the job. 

b. AUTHORITY - In the Federal sector, Federal law requires that Agencies have the ability to offer counseling services to employees. The EAP is the vehicle through which these laws are implemented (Public Law 79-658 (5 U.S.C. § 7901), 91-616 (42 U.S.C. § 290aa-1), and 92-255; Executive Order 12564 Drug Free Work Place Act; and the Americans with Disability Act Amendment Act (ADAAA). The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as the lead Agency for Federal EAPs under these laws, offers a number of recommendations regarding the provision of EAP services. i. Specifically, EAP services should: 

1. be effective and efficient, and, based on the best available professional practices; 
2. be provided within a safe, secure, and confidential environment; 
3. maintain clear and open lines of communication with stakeholders; 
4. treat clients equitably while demonstrating flexibility in meeting their needs; 
5. allow clients appropriate control over their own care; and 
6. provide continuity of care to help clients achieve their goals. 

ii. The EAP must embrace OPM's guidelines, and incorporates them into service delivery.

<DESC>This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation <strong>Brand Name or Equal (COMPETITIVE)</strong>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has the requirement to procure the following brand name item: ABSCIEX QTRAP 6500+ SYSTEM, product number: 5039926, from Ab Sciex LLC, 1201 Radio Road, Redwood City, CA 94065-1217, USA or Equal. <br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The combined synopsis/ solicitation number remains the same: HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-SS-2016-722.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5- Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. <br /><br />The Government contemplates only one award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract. The Associated North America Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 334516 and the Business Size Standard is 1000 employees. It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> <br />The Translational Gerontology Branch (TGB) of the NIA, encompasses research from drug discovery to clinical and longitudinal studies, from in vitro models to research on a variety of model organisms, rodents and non-human primates. This branch is investigating and developing methods and interventions to support healthy aging and to prevent or delay the onset of functional decline and age-related diseases. The goals of the branch are focused on the translation of the discoveries made in the human longitudinal and clinical, model organisms to the basic biology and vice versa. Investigators in TGB are also developing strategies to unveil the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the functional decline that occurs with age aiming to develop and test interventions that delay aging processes. Thus, TGB, plans to purchase an AB SCIEX QTRAP&reg; 6500 System, to process the human plasma samples for the proteomics and metabolomics data.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objective:<br /></strong>The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase a high sensitivity, bench top hybrid triple quadruple Linear Accelerator<sup>TM</sup> trap mass spectrometer designed for LC/MS/MS analyses. This instrument provides an uncompromised combination of Linear Accelerator ion trap and triple quadrupole functionality, uniquely allowing both qualitative and quantitative analyses to be carried out in a single experiment. This hybrid configuration is unique to QTRAP technology and allows the QTRAP 6500 to perform critical experiments that are not possible on any other mass spectrometer.</p>

<p><strong>Salient Purchase Description:<br /></strong>&bull; Purchase of The AB SCIEX QTRAP&reg; 6500 System is a high sensitivity, bench top hybrid triple quadrupole Linear Accelerator<sup>TM</sup> trap mass spectrometer designed for LC/MS/MS analyses.<br />&bull; This instrument provides an uncompromised combination of Linear Accelerator ion trap and triple quadrupole functionality, uniquely allowing both qualitative and quantitative analyses to be carried out in a single experiment. The hybrid configuration is unique to QTRAP technology and allows the QTRAP 6500 to perform critical experiments that are not possible on any other mass spectrometer. <br />&bull; This system when installed will be a source of high quality Proteomics and metabolomics experiments in the lab. <br />&bull; One time download; full triple quadrupole mass spectrometer functionality including multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), neutral loss and precursor ion scanning. MRM experiments will be used for detecting and quantitating drugs, drug metabolites and other analytes of interest at low to sub femtogram levels<br />&bull; Full linear acceleration ion trap functionality, including MS/MS (enhanced product ion scanning or EPI) and MS3. This functionality is critical for streamlining the assay development process and for acquiring confirmatory scans that can be matched to entries in drug databases. A library match can be key to defending data in court. <br />&bull; Triple-Trap scanning is unique to the QTRAP technology and will be utilized to provide higher quality data in a shorter amount of time than other mass spectrometers. In this mode, MRM scans are used to detect or quantitate the presence of specific analytes. Once detected, the instrument switches to ion trap mode to perform a high sensitivity MS/MS (EPI) experiment, thus confirming the structure of the compound. Enhanced resolution and MS3 scans can be incorporated into this workflow. <br />&bull; A powerful and unique aspect of this workflow is the similar detection limits that can be reached for the EPI and MRM scans, allowing for confirmatory EPI scans to be acquired on virtually any analyte that is detected by MRM. In Triple-Trap mode the 6500 QTRAP is able to scan 100 MRM transitions followed by a precursor scan (500 Da) and a neutral loss scan (500 Da) followed by two Enhanced Product Ion scans in 1.5 seconds. <br />&bull; This workflow is unique to QTRAP technology and will provide more comprehensive data sets for casework than any other mass spectrometer. Another application of triple trap scanning will be for the development of new assays that detect new or more specific drugs or drug metabolites. Precursor ion or neutral loss scanning experiments can be used to discover new "candidate" analytes and trap scanning can be used for structural confirmation of the candidates.<br />&bull; To NIA's knowledge, Quantitation by MRM3 is only available on QTRAP instruments. MRM3 scans can be applied to complex assays that are subject to interferences from co-eluting compounds or matrix ions. Enhanced Resolution Scanning: using the linear ion trap the QTRAP can acquire spectra with resolving power (measured FWHM) &gt;9000 in 10s of milliseconds. No triple quadrupole mass spectrometer has this capability. <br />&bull; To NIA's knowledge, no other vendor can provide the complete QTRAP technology as it is protected by several AB SCIEX patents; as well, AB SCIEX is the sole manufacturer of QTRAP mass spectrometers and the only vendor for our products.</p>

It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p><strong>Background:<br /></strong>The mission of The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. This purchase will ultimately increase the capability to optimize biochemical, cellular and model organism-based assays submitted by the biomedical research community; and perform automated high-throughput screening (HTS) and high-content screening (HCS).</p>
<p>Also, the Probe Development group is part of The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). The Probe Development group utilizes 3D bioprinting techniques to generate tissues which will be used to perform studies into causes and treatments of various diseases. This approach can provide data more relevant to the whole body response than traditional studies which use two dimensional cell cultures. Initial research is being performed to advance fabrication techniques and protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:<br /></strong>The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase a Leica Multi Photon Microscope, a Leica IHC/ISH Research Platform, and a Leica Digital Pathology Whole Slide Scanner.

<p><strong>Mandatory Criteria/Requirements:<br /></strong>1) Multi Photon Microscope<br />o System must use a single prism as the Primary element for spectral separation because a prism has uniform and high transmission (&gt;95%) across the entire visible spectrum. Experiments will include imaging large data sets with short and long wavelength fluorophores of varying intensities and dynamic ranges. A grating for spectral separation will not be acceptable due to lower overall efficiency and non-uniform spectral diffraction.<br />o System must include 3 simultaneous and completely independent spectrally tunable detectors, gap-free, and each with their own primary gain. The system must be upgradeable to 5 simultaneous spectral detectors. This will allow for maximum spectral flexibility and efficiency in selecting optimal emission bands for a wide variety of fluorophores and fluorescent proteins.<br />o System must include 2 Internal Spectral and 2 External NDD Hybrid GaAsP detectors (HyDs), not GaAsP PMTs because samples will include extremely bright and dim structures within the field of view. Only HyDs have the required dynamic range (up to 300 mega-counts per second for HyDs vs only up to 5 mega-counts per second for GaAsP PMTs). <br />o System must include an 8,000 lines-per-second Resonant Scanner that allows continuous scan field rotation and continuous zoom (64X) because this will allow us to critically orient elongated specimens parallel to the X scanner and facilitate faster image acquisition, up to 300 frames per second with 4 channels active simultaneously.<br />o System must include a special IR APO 25X/0.95 Water Immersion objective (high transmission up to 1300nm) with 2.4mm of free working distance and be corrected for use with a coverslip. This will allow us to image fluorescently labelled cells on the far side of a thick scaffolding in a special chamber.<br />o System must include an IR APO 40X/1.1 Water Immersion objective with motorized correction collar to facilitate remote adjustment via software and remote control panel during large Z series acquisition. This will facilitate optimized correction for aberrations when imaging thick samples at depth without disturbing the sample environment.<br />o System must include a Galvo Z Stage for real-time XZ scanning of slides, dishes, and multi-well plates to allow visualization of thick samples in a single scan.<br />o System must include a high precision XY Scanning stage for tile scan (mosaic) imaging, mark and find time lapse experiments, and high content screening.<br />o System must include hardware and software for high content screening, with the ability to define a "focus map" for non-uniform, undulating tissue. This will preclude the need for larger than necessary Z series and increase acquisition speed for large tile scans and multi-well plate imaging.<br />o System must include a laser safety enclosure for MP imaging with temperature and CO2 control for long term time lapse imaging of live cells and tissue.<br />o The instrumentation must be able to fit onto table with footprint of no greater than 1500 mm x 1950 mm, with the computer on a table of no more than 80 cm x 80 cm, to so that it will fit comfortably into the room allotted.</p>
<p>2) IHC/ISH Research Platform<br />o System must be able to fully automate more than just IHC staining, it must also be able to automate ISH/FISH/IF testing. This will give the lab flexibility and the ability to meet varied research project request while giving the lab a platform for growth. <br />o System must be fully able to fully automate baking/dewax/antigen retrieval/ and staining of slide in less than 2.5 hours for IHC testing. Full automation allows for consistent staining results tech-to-tech and day-to-day and improves TAT, efficiency, and productivity in the lab.<br />o System must have a truly open reagent system and the ability to use 3rd party detection systems, antibodies, and molecular probes. In addition, system must be able to utilize predefined protocols or to easily customize protocols. This is necessary so that the lab may meet the varied research project requests and the demands of many primary investigators.<br />o System must use a cover tile technology for preserving tissue &amp; cellular morphology. A cover tile is necessary for protecting tissue and preventing tissue loss, for applying reagents gently to tissue, and for creating a reaction chamber which prevents tissue drying while delivering excellent staining results.<br />o System must be self-contained with no water &amp; waste hook-ups required. It must also be able to separate out hazardous waste from non-hazardous waste. This is important because allows the lab to use space efficiently without external requirements and improves safety in the lab by separating out hazardous waste. <br />o System must be able to easily automate multiplexing of IHC/IF/ISH stains. Being able to look at more than one stain on a single slide is ever more paramount in histology and this will allow the lab to meet the more complex requests of researchers and investigators.<br />o System must be able to change heated marker steps and add/remove wash steps as necessary. The ability to successfully customize robust staining protocols is imperative and being able to change the heated marker and wash steps allow for the use of 3rd party probes which is especially important for the denaturation and hybridization of tissue for ISH &amp; FISH testing.<br />o System must have an easy to use graphical user interface and the stainer should require minimal maintenance. The ability for all users to easily operate the instrument with minimal weekly &amp; monthly maintenance is important to maintain efficiency and productivity in the lab.<br />o System should be a bench top stainer and not more than 31" wide or 31" deep fully self-contained. Very efficient use of counter space and ability to place it in the lab were best fits into current work flow is imperative. <br />o System should be a barcode driven system using OCR (optical character recognition) technology and it should be able to read both 2-D &amp; 3-D barcode, system should have a 30-slide capacity in 3-drawers of 10-slides which can be run independently of each other for continuous throughput, and system should hold at least 36-reagents. A barcode driven system with OCR technology ensures consistent staining quality and leaves no room for operator error due to missing or inadequate reagents to complete a staining run. The ability to independently operate 3 drawers of 10-slides each allows for continuous throughput unlike batch stainers which will make the lab more efficient, productive, and increases TAT.</p>
<p>3) Slide Scanner<br />o The slide scanner is a high speed automated imaging scanner that can scan both bright field and high resolution fluorescence whole slide images on one integrated platform to allow both types of scanning in the same batch. <br />o Must be an automated microscope for true 40X and 63X high magnification scanning, and for high resolution bright field and high resolution fluorescence images.<br />o System must have motorized z-focus to automate focusing while scanning and for Z-stacking of fluorescence images<br />o Must have 8x fluorescence cube positions to allow for custom filter changing to accommodate multiplex assays being run.<br />o Must have an automated camera changer to have ability to scan brightfield and fluorescent slides in the same batch<br />o The controller must be high specification computer using windows 7 operating system an, 64 bit with 126GB RAM to allow for faster scanning, processing, and for standardized integration to the network<br />o Brightfield Colour camera is USB 3 camera 2048 x 2048 pixels (4.1 MP), 90 FPS,CMOS, 5.5um pixels, 40 fps<br />o Fluorescent monochrome camera is high sensitivity and high quantum efficiency for fluorescent scanning, 2560 x 2160 pixels (5.5MP)<br />o Automated slide loader with up to 200 slide capacity accommodating four - 50 position racks to allow for large 200 slide batches or to add slides racks to running batches.<br />o Must have slide label image reader and barcode reader model Keyence SR-700 to import and document meta data from each slide<br />o Must be able to include an automated slide oiler with high capacity oil well for large batches for high resolution scanning using 40X or 63X oil objectives to achieve better resolution of images where dry objectives cannot achieve. <br />o Actual Objectives available for true resolution 1.25X, 5X, 10X, 20X, 40X (dry or oil), 63X (dry or oil)<br />o Must contain filter positions to support up to eight separate channels for multi-channel and multiplexed fluorescence imaging. <br />o Must come with Fluorescent multistain separation image analysis to allow for area or cellular immunofluorescence quantitation of whole slide images<br />o Must be able to include Network Attached Storage Drive (NAS) 2.0 GHz quad-core processor, 6x 6TB HDD pre-installed using RAID5 configuration giving 22TB of usable storage, with 4x Ethernet ports, 3x USB 3.0 , 2x USB 2.0, 1xHDMI in order to have a simple local starage device to manage all of the images.<br />o Must be able to direct export images to .SCN file format allowing automatic integration into eSlide Manager Data Management System which enables a centralized data management system to keep meta data and images, search and retrieve images or data, sharing projects across researchers, access from outside network, batch image analysis, or ability to run smart pattern tissue recognition software or TMA lab analysis in the future.<br />o Must be able to open images using ImageScope viewer to allow scientists to access a whole slide image viewer with some anatomic annotation tools like a length measurement tool, area annotation tool, and an area image analysis tool that are all built in.<br />o System must be able to be integrated to a server for data management, network sharing, or server side analysis<br />o Image analysis can be performed using the Aperio suite of analytic tools integrated in eSlide Manager or by using Versa software system analytics. <br />o Must be able to include and perform tissue microarray (TMA) segregation scanning and analysis using integrated TMA software.</p>

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

Major lengths of stone walls are missing due to decades of deferred maintenance and moving walls to other parts of the battlefield.  The reconstruction of 2,430 lineal stonewalls will mark critical battle positions that were present on July 3, 1863.
