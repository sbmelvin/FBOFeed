Loads may be single items or comprised of multiple, odd-shaped bundles.  The cargo system must be capable of in terfacing with the ECDS platform, which is similar to the 463L (HCU-6/E) pallet in length (108-in) and width (88-in), with similar tie-down provisions that will be supplemented by platform deck provisions.    The ECDS cargo restraint shall be simple in des ign, maintenance, operation, and have the potential for refurbishment.  The ECDS cargo restraint system must have the following capabilities: 1) Contain single or modular loads of 10,000 lbs (total rigged weight) and provide adequate restraint for aerial t ransport and delivery (airdrop); 2) Compatible with the ECDS platform and the 4633L pallet; 3) Capable of gravity release airdrop operations from an altitude of 500 feet AGL, at 140 to 150 knots indicated air speed (KIAS); 4) Durable, lightweight and reusa ble 12 times (threshold) and 25 times (objective); 5) Deliver loads in fully mission capable (FMC) condition with minimal modification to standard airdrop rigging (threshold) and FMC condition with no change to the airdrop rigging (objective); 6) Capable o f being rigged in a time not greater than the time required for current comparable CDS loads with like capacities (threshold) or less than time of currently required (objective); 7) Capable of storage in the same climate categories (hot, basic, and cold) a s current airdrop items; 8) Must be supportable by the standard Army logistics system, and maintainable by MOS 92R rigger personnel at organizational level; and 9) Must not degrade the overall performance of current airdrop operations.  Emphasis will be gi ven to durable lightweight materials, simplified rigging procedures and low/simplified maintenance.   The objective of this solicitation is to acquire, test and evaluate cargo restraint systems capable of meeting the aforementioned requirements.  To be con sidered, offerors shall submit proposals with supporting analytical or test data and drawings of their product.  The proposals and data submitted will be evaluated to determine the products ability to meet above requirements.  Offerors of proposals that ar e determined to be acceptable after the initial evaluation and within the competitive range will be awarded a FFP purchase order to deliver 2 (minimum) to 10 (maximum) sample cargo restraint systems for testing and evaluation.  The Government anticipates m ultiple awards for cargo restraint systems to test and evaluate.  Test cargo restraint samples will undergo evaluation by Army users for fit, form and function, and will also be subjected to static and dynamic ground testing as well as airdrop testing.  Af ter testing and evaluation, a down-select will be conducted by an Integrated Product Team (IPT) to determine a single offeror to be issued an Cost-Plus Award Fee (CPAF) IDIQ contract to deliver 10 (minimum) to 100 (maximum) ECDS cargo restraint systems.  T hese items will be subjected to Developmental/Operational Testing (DT/OT) to determine if they satisfy all performance requirements identified in the RFP.

All intereste d firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this solicitation.  Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government.  This a cquisition will be conducted on a full and open/unrestricted competitive basis.  NAICS Code is 332999.  Any concern employing 500 or fewer employees is considered a small business.  This acquisition will utilize best value source selection.  The Best Value  Source selection will be based on the following factors: Technical, Management, Cost/Price, Past Performance, and Small and Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization.  Technical is the most important factor.  It is more important than Management, which is equal in importance to Cost/Price.

<DESC>NA NAICS CODE:  54611 The U. S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, intends to award a sole source contract to Primavera Systems, Incorporation, Bala Cynwyd, PA, in support of the P2 System. The anticipated contract will be award as an indefinite delivery/indefinit e quantity (IDIQ) service type contract with option provisions for Time and Material (T&M) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) labor rates and cost reimbursable travel expenses. The USACE has a requirement to implement its next generation of a project management information system, a commercial solution.  The commercial solution will be a tool to effectively manage projects within USACEs three core mission areas.  The solutions components include Oracle Projects, Oracle Financial Analyzer, Oracle Discoverer, Oracle Tutor and Primaveras P3e.  The PROMIS System is the repository for the majority of USACE project management information. P2 System, as the new project management syst em for USACE, will replace the PROMIS functionality.  The data from PROMIS will be converted to P2 System in order to make use of the information currently stored in the PROMIS repository and eliminate the need for manual entry of the information in P2 Sys tem.  PROMIS like CEFMS consists of a distributed Oracle database structure.  Each district or center PROMIS system uses a separate instance of the Oracle database. The P2 System requires the integration of Primavera P3E with Oracle based project management tools; thus, insight into the P3E source code may be required.  This effort provides P3E functional and technical resources to support the completion of developmen t, deployment and maintenance of the USACE business processes and the P2 System.  The contractor will continue to interface with the P2 Team on the corporate business/system requirements, provide guidance as the P3e expert to advise the USACE/Oracle team r esponsible for the deployment/configuration of the P2 System, and develop detailed functional and design specifications.  In addition, the contractor shall provide technical assistance on the system deployment, development of training material, training su pport (to include actual training), and provide technical support during P2 System operations and maintenance phase.  The contractor shall also provide annual maintenance of the licensed COTS software.  In addition, training for of support USACE-wide train ing of the P2 System to commence 1 January 2003.  The contractor must have resources or an established network to support simultaneous deployment (training and actual system installation) to different organizations within USACE.  This simultaneous deployme nt will include CONUS and OCONUS locations. There is no other known source who can provide continuation of this service. This is not a formal solicitation. The synopsis of intent to issue a sole source award to Primavera Systems, Inc., Bala Cynwyd, PA, is not a request for proposals/offers.  Primavera Systems Inc., the current contractor, has been working this effort since its inception in August 2000.  Primavera is the owner of the software P3e licenses, which has been purchased for USACE as a major application of the P2 System.  Only Primave ra has access to the P3e source code to determine, if required, interface, integration of P3E with the Oracle products, and the interface with legacy USACE systems.  Only Primavera can provide the services required for USACE wide fielding. Only Primavera h as the detailed knowledge of on-going P3E upgrades necessary to optimize the USACE P2 System design, and USACE IT infrastructure requirements.  Only Primavera has the operability details of the web-based Primavision application that will allow USACE to ide ntify a cost effective architecture within which to implement P2.  Primavera alone, has the detailed knowledge of the P2 System hands-on keystroke course material.  Only Primavera has an established on-going relationship with partners (mostly small busin esses) thro ughout the nation and overseas to support USACEs actual instruction requirements.  These requirements may include actual classroom instruction for approximately 25,000 USACE team members.  Based upon Primaveras unique knowledge and past performance on P2 , no other contractor can perform this effort without severe performance, cost and schedule impacts.   While Primavera will utilize small businesses as subcontractors in some of the actual training being provided to USACE, the contracting officer and the project manager in conjunction with the small business office has agreed to consider direct award of tra ining requirements from 1 October 2003  15 March 2004 to small businesses.  Therefore, training requirements for the period after 1 October 2003 will be included in this contract as an option to be exercised only if direct award to small businesses is not  to be in the best interest of the Government. Contractors who feel they can provide the U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, with the above services, as specified above are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response which includes, as a minimum, the capability to do the wo rk and evidence of experience, any applicable pricing data, and any information indicating a bona fide ability to meet this specific requirement. All responsible sources may respond to this synopsis, and all such responses will be considered by the agency.   Any interested contractors should contact Primavera Systems, Inc., Bala Plaza, Suite 700, Bala Cynwyd, PA  190004, for subcontracting opportunities. Reference Note 22, the 30 day period for submitting responses is inapplicable, the agency only requires a  15 day period and will control the issuance of the solicitation to the contractor. If no written responses are received within 10 calendar days after the publication date, this office will pursue a sole source award. Responses should be submitted in writi ng to Demetria Chunn, Contract Specialist at www.Demetria.Chunn@hnd01.usace.army.mil. Responses may be submitted facsimile number 256-895-1197. Telephonic requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) has a requirement for the development of algorithms to densify and reposition soil mapping units derived from a 1:1 million digital soils database, digital terrain elevation data, and LANDSAT orthophotomosaics. 

To our knowledge, NIMA and TAMUS/BREC together have the only copy of a historical set of consistent worldwide soil maps developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Conservation Service (SCS) at a scale of 1:1M.  Under an earlier agreement, NIMA and TAMUS/BREC converted these hard copy 1:1M soil maps to digital form.  At the end of this study, all ownership rights of the digital database that was developed were vested with TAMUS/BREC.  Also under this earlier agreement, a study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of repositioning and enhancing the positional accuracy of the 1:1M soil boundaries and/or creating larger-scale soils data using this digital soils data, new semi-automated landform extraction and delineation techniques, and the computational power of modern computers.  Under this new work, NIMA and the university will create algorithms, link existing GIS software, establish soil and landform mapping rules, and program the storage/retrieval procedures needed to create larger-scale landform and soil maps for the world.  The main objectives of this agreement are as follows:

1.	Develop algorithms to more accurately position and densify the soil mapping units in the 1:1M digital soils database compiled under the original agreement, with an objective digital soils database having a density of soil polygons equivalent to a scale of 1:250K or larger.
2.	Develop and document a soils intensification and densification production process, incorporating the algorithms developed for repositioning and densifying the 1:1M digital soil-mapping units.
3.	Develop a real-time demonstration of the soils intensification and densification production process, including assisted soils/landform feature identification, delineation, and attribution algorithms.

Universities that can obtain the necessary data and perform the required efforts described herein are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the NIMA Agreements Officer.  The final determination of suitability for this award is within the discretion of the Government.  All responses must be e-mailed to NIMA, Attn: Christina Stans, stanscc@nima.mil by 2:00 P.M., EST, 13 November 2002.  It is the responsibility of the sender to confirm if e-emails have been received.

<SUBJECT>A--RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR A MISSION RECONFIGURABLE UNMANNED UNDERSEA VEHICLE (MRUUV).
<SOLNBR>MRUUV
<CONTACT>James E. Watkins 202-781-3957 MaryAnn Keyser 202-781-3957
<DESC>NAVSEA intends to award a contract to design and build a 21 diameter Mission Reconfigurable Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (MRUUV).  The MRUUV is intended as a submarine (SSN688 and Virginia Class) operated system capable of meeting the Navys requirements for clandestine intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and limited ocean survey.  The system will be housed in the submarines torpedo room with launch and recovery through the submarines torpedo tubes.  The MRUUV will consist of two sections, a basic vehicle and a mission payload.  The basic vehicle is defined as the propulsion, energy, navigation, communications, electronics, guidance and control, obstacle avoidance, and launch and recovery capability, as well as the support equipment that allows the MRUUV to conduct basic vehicle functions.  Payloads are mission specific hardware, which when integrated into the basic veh icle allows the MRUUV to conduct the desired missions.  The Navy plans to use full and open competition to award a single contract for the procurement of the MRUUV System.  The base contract award will be to design, fabricate and test an Advance Development UUV to demonstrate the system modularity, payload reconfigurablity, and interfaces required to support a mission reconfigurable UUV.  This award will also include the design and fabrication of a mine identification payload to support system testing.  A second payload will be provided as GFE to test the ability of the vehicle to operate with different payloads.     The award will contain an option for the design, fabrication, and test of the MRUUV System.  One major condition for option exercise will be the successful completion of the Advance Development UUV design based upon Government design review.  The option exercise  includes requirements for the contractor to conduct a series of engineering trade studies to ensure the best balance of its original proposal design and any lessons learned from the Advance Development UUV.  The final product will include a detailed, integrated MRUUV System design and an engineering development model ready to support system testing and potentially transition to a Fleet asset.  The Navy will open and maintain a Technical Information Center (TIC) on 11 November 2002 to provide additional technical information relating to this solicitation.  Information on the TIC will be available beginning 10 November from Mary Barravecchia, at phone number (401) 832-4338.  Companies/individuals who are interested in access to the TIC, or who wish to participate in the review of and industry feedback regarding draft specifications, must submit a written request to Mary Barravecc hia at Naval Undersea Warfare Center, 1176 Howell Street, Bldg. 103, Newport, RI 02841 or fax number (401) 832-3699.  The request must include: the company's name, a brief description of the company's or individual's expertise in the above categories, company's CAGE code, and contact information.  Once the request has been accepted, the requesting company/individual will be given access to the TIC.  Firms interested in contracting or subcontracting opportunities are encouraged to make their interests known in order that a Bidder's List can be established for other firms or individuals that may be interested in subcontracting opportunities.  The point of contact is James E. Watkins, Code 02633W; Naval Sea Systems Command; 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE, Stop 2050; Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-2050.  This is not a request for proposals, a promise to issue a request for proposals, no r a promise by the Government to pay for information received in response to this synopsis or any subsequent synopsis announcing the availability of draft specifications for industry participation and feedback.  Establishment of the TIC does not obligate the Government to award a contract and does not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition strategy.  Release of the RFP is scheduled for early December.

<DESC>Project Information  This project will include design of a new Space Science research facility for the Space Sciences Directorate at Goddard Space Flight Center. The goal of the project is to construct a world-class, state of the art facility to allow NASA to conduct cutting-edge research for the next 50 years.	The new building will consolidate the GSFC Space Science Directorate personnel and laboratory facilities into a single building.  Currently Directorate assets are distributed among 6 major buildings scattered throughout the GSFC campus.  The new building will also serve as the first major project in the implementation of the GSFC Master Plan.  The proposed building is approximately 200,000 net square feet and will house chemistry and electronic instrument development laboratories, cleanrooms, high bay assembly areas, computer rooms and administrative office space for approximately 900 scientists and support staff.  Major interior building subsystems will include electrical, fire protection and alarm systems, mechanical and plumbing systems, communication and information management systems, and utility distribution systems for laboratory work spaces.  The project includes all related site development design, such as utility systems upgrades and extensions, access roads, paving, walks, curbs, gutters, parking, fencing, storm water management, etc.  The project may also include the demolition and relocation of existing facilities as necessary to site the new building.   The design of the facility will be flexible enough to allow rapid, cost effective reconfiguration of utilities and laboratory spaces to accommodate changing program requirements.  The architectural design will create a pleasant, efficient work environment for the building occupants, and the layout will promote and enhance collaboration between the various scientific groups.  This building will incorporate sustainable design concepts and should be designed to attain at least a "silver" LEED certification.      The estimated construction cost of this project is between $50 to $100 million.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for high-density tape drives that will be installed into StorageTek Powderhorn Silos.	These tape drives will be part of the primary data archive at NASA Ames for data generated by DAO scientific applications.  Drives from other manufactures will not be able to physically interface with the silos.  Due to the requirement to integrate the new drives with the existing drives within the silos, solutions involving drives that are not mounted within the silos are not acceptable. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from StorageTek.	The requirement is to integrate the new drives with the existing drives within the silos, solutions involving drives that are not mounted within the silos are not acceptable.  In order to achieve a major, critical data migration, the new drives must be capable of reading data that is on 3000 existing tapes that were created using StorageTek drives.  Only StorageTek tape drives will be able to read these tapes.	The tape drives need to be able to achieve this highly critical operational goal. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 23, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Institute Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Experimental Therapeutics Branch( ETB), Neurophysiological Pharmacology Section (NPS) plans to enter into a sole source contract with Anne Kask, Harpers Ferry, WV 25425.  This procurement will provide continued technical support on Intramural Research Project (Z01 NS 02139-22 ET) Pharmacology and Physiology of the Substantia Nigra and Basal Ganglia.  This project involves investigation of the role of specific neurotransmitters in regulating neuronal activity in extra pyramidal systems.  The long-range goal is to develop improved treatments to compensate for neuronal degeneration and dysfunctions, which occur in a variety of neurological disorders involving the basal ganglia and substantia nigra.  The short-range goal is to achieve a better understanding of how specific neurotransmitter systems affect information processing in the basal ganglia. Current focus is on the mechanisms underlying the ability of dopamine-containing neurons to maintain appropriate functional output from the basal ganglia.  Ms. Kask will perform data analysis, computer upgrading and maintenance in support of this project.   All data is collected and manipulated using computers, the laboratory has 11 computers and one backup server that must be kept in working order. Data, using the lab computers, is collected from two to four electrode arrays of 8 electrodes each implanted in different brain regions of the rat.  Data representing waveform and timing of the action potentials need to be analyzed and displayed in graphic form in order to further process various periods for cross correlations on spike trains from all the different pairs of neurons recorded.  Composite computer-based graphic output of Lomb periodogram analysis of the single unit data will be required.  In addition, brains need to be processed for histological confirmation of recording sites from the same experiments.  Ms Kask is experienced in these techniques in the context of the specific needs of the laboratory.  She has experience with localizing the globus pallidus in the rat brain, cutting the tissue, making slides and staining them to localize the various electrode termination sites.  She has worked with the Design CAD software program, in conjunction with Excel spread sheets, knows the codes for the drug administration protocol, the format for the output of the Lomb periodogram and how to integrate these programs to provide a graphical output that allows the laboratory researchers to further pinpoint the times to be analyzed with cross correlation software.  It is anticipated that award will be made for a base year plus two, one year options.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on October 29,  2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the services of a contractor to provide INTERNATIONAL MAIL PRE-SORT CONSOLIDATION SERVICES.  The United States Postal Service (USPS) offers significant discounts on the price of sending international mail if that mail is presorted to the destination country before it is entered into the postal system.  The use of a mail consolidator to sort the mail is essential in the continuing effort to reduce the IRS mail costs.  It is extremely important to distinguish between an INTERNATIONAL MAIL CONSOLIDATOR and an INTERNATIONAL REMAILER.  An international mail consolidator sorts the mail according to USPS specifications and enters the mail in the USPS system.  Therefore the IRS is paying postage to an American postal system and receives all of the protections and quality of that service.  An international remailer sorts the mail and enters it into the postal service of a foreign country to postmark and mail.  While postal rates are sometimes less expensive in the country from where the mail is sent, service has been shown to be less reliable and the IRS would paying a foreign mail system.  Additionally, all international mail must have a return address of the country from which it is mailed.  For example, if a remailer puts the mail into the Panamanian postal system, the mail must have a Panama return address in order to be delivered.  This would preclude the use of a remailer as all IRS mail to be processed under this contract has a United States return address.  The successful vendor selected to fulfill the requirements of a contract awarded from this solicitation shall be designated a PRE-QUALIFIED WHOLESALER, as outlined by the USPS Pre-qualified Wholesaler Program.  This program allows a unique working agreement between the USPS and the consolidator so that both parties, as well as any customers, benefit from a work sharing and volume pricing arrangement.  The standards that the wholesaler must meet to gain this designation guarantee that the contractor is well versed in this type of operation and will be able to fully meet all requirements of the contract.  Each potential offeror submitting a proposal must show proof of such designation by the USPS.  A Request for Quotations (RFQ), TIRNO-03-Q-00001 will be issued on or about OCTOBER 16, 2002.  Offers in response to the RFQ are due not later than 3:00 PM, Monday, November 4, 2002, at the address shown above.  Interested parties may obtain a copy of the RFQ from the IRS Procurement website: http://www.procurement.irs.treas.gov/.  No telephone requests will be honored.  Numbered Note #1 - 100% small business set-aside.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The RFP is now expected to be ready for release on or about 21 October 2002.  The Government no longer intends the RFP to restrict the EO/IR sensor assembly used in the AP to the Multi-Mission Common Modular UAV Advanced EO/IR Sensor currently under  development for the U.S. Government by Wescam.  The Block 1 ASTAMIDS will provide a Unit of Action (UA) asset that can be used in Tactical Operations in day and night, real time, to detect and locate obstacles and surface and recently buried minefields. T he ASTAMIDS will be deployed on a Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) Block 2, or another UAV with equal or greater payload capacity, such as the future Extended Range/Multi Purpose (ER/MP) UAV or Future Combat Systems (FCS) UAVs. [The point of contact  for the TUAV Block 2 is Mr. Pete Mullowney of AAI Corp, Hunt Valley, MD.

The standard interfaces shall provide required connectivity and support. The TGS shall consist of the software to perform mission planning and in-flight payload control of the TUAV and of the AP. The TGS shall perform analysis of retrieved imagery and data and transmit mission results to the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) network. The TGS shall also consist of the imagery and data processing hardware, software, and firmware required to generate, display, and disseminate products to the users via the A rmy C4I network. Only minimal modifications to the common Army GCS are allowed. The RFP will be issued on the Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP), https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to revise the response date, change the MDA point of contact, and reissue the original BAA description by incorporating all the previous modifications as follows:  The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend the United States and its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack.  As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capability or improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats.  To investigate these new technologies, MDA has established a Deputy for Advanced Concepts (AC) whose mission is to pursue and assess innovative concepts and develop algorithms to improve BMDS capability.  MDA/AC has established an Innovation Cell, which consists of a team of experts to evaluate new ballistic missile defense concepts and technologies.  The MDA/AC Innovation Cell seeks new and innovative concepts for integrated systems and for technical improvements in the boost, midcourse, and terminal phases of missile defense.  Specific research objectives for each missile defense phase encompass Surveillance, Track & Discrimination, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, and Kill Assessment.  Concepts are sought in the following seven technology areas: (1) Radar Systems, including Integrated System Concepts, Cross Sections and Signatures, Measurements (waveforms, data extraction), Hardware (transmit/receive modules), Signal Processing, Data Visualization, Data Compression, Image Interpretation, Seekers; (2) Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems, including High Energy Lasers, Beam Control, Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar Systems, Optical Signal Processing, Focal Plane Arrays, Lethality Mechanisms; (3) Mathematics and Computer Science, including Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Software, Probability and Statistics, and Pattern Recognition; (4) Electrical Engineering, including Digital Electronics and Signal Processing, Machine Implementation of Algorithms, Analog Circuits and Communications, Computer Vision, Distributed Computing; (5) Physics and Chemistry, including Electrodynamics, Nuclear Physics and Weapons Effects, Infrared and Optical Signatures, Energy Conversion, and Rocket Plume Analysis; (6) Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, including Space Systems, Missile System Aerodynamics, Propulsion, and Reentry Physics, Guidance and Control, and Materials Science; and (7) Battle Management/Command and Control, including Engagement Planning, Tactics, Intelligence Exploitation, and Countermeasures, Decision Theory and Modeling, Target Tracking, Classification, Identification, and Discrimination, and Sensor Fusion.  If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary concept paper (requested limit of five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA program; (2) a Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities.  Offerors, which have been certified as a Small Business Concern, should indicate that status on their submittal.  Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .pdf file) to the point of contact listed below.  MDA will evaluate these responses based upon the following criteria (all criteria of equal importance): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include the maturity of the technology and the level of risk; (2) the scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; (3) the offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (ROCM).  Offerors are reminded that a BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35.016).  White Papers related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA will remain open until September 30, 2003. Responses will be evaluated as received, but may take up to six months to complete.  If MDA decides to pursue a concept, a formal proposal will be requested.  The MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in FYs 2002 - 2004, and will most likely be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type of arrangement.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  The point of contact for concept submittals and questions is Richard Baumgartner at (703) 695-9086 or email at Richard.Baumgartner@mda.osd.mil.

<SUBJECT>Y--Replacement of hydroelectric generator and associated step-up transformer with a Powerformer-type system.

<CONTACT>Dion T. Steele Contract Specialist 9169785142     dsteele@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is seeking sources for a requirement to replace the existing hydroelectric generator and associated step-up transformer at the Folsom powerplant with a generator that can produce the same power output and can be directly connected to the high voltage circuit in the Folsom Switchyard.  The existing generator is 3-phase rated at 69 MVA, 0.96pf, 13.8-kV but capable of 71.7 MVA continuously.  The step-up transformer is a 3-phase, 13.6-kV to 115-kV rated 66 MVA.  The replacement generator will be rated at 71.7 MVA 0.96 pf  and will be capable of being directly connected to the 115-kV switchyard.  Reclamation has determined that replacement of the existing generator and transformer with a high voltage generator will result in financial economies through reduced equipment replacement and maintenance costs and higher efficiency, and will be environmentally safer to operate. The existing equipment was originally installed in 1955.  The generator was last rewound in 1972 by Westinghouse.  The unit is operated as a peaking generator with two or more starts and stops per day.   The efficiency of the existing generator has been tested at 98.2%.   The new generator is expected to achieve an efficiency of at least 98.5% The required work includes manufacturing, furnishing, and installing all necessary generator and ancillary components from the turbine shaft, up to and including the high voltage bushing of the existing115-kV switchyard unit breaker.   The work also includes a new excitation system and generator protection system.    Since the powerplant is an integral part of the local electrical system and is necessary to ensure the system's reliability, the period of time that the unit is taken out of service for the installation must be minimized.  As part of the installation, the contractor shall disassemble, remove, and dispose of the components not required for the replacement.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service is actively working to develop and implement a strategic agenda to reduce material handling labor costs and improve service.  While this strategic plan is not yet finalized, there are certain facets of the plan where it is clear that new technologies and systems, not commercially available, will need to be pursued.   As such, there is a need to begin to take these requirements to industry and pursue solutions that offer generative opportunities for investment, with the goal of folding this technology into the strategic agenda.  The Postal Service envisions developing next generation material handling equipment solutions, which will require rapid concepting, prototyping, maturation, and/or preproduction work primarily in the areas of platform, receipt/opening, dispatch, distribution and flats handling/preparation operations.  This work will be advanced through the selection and award of either a single contract for each area or concept or through multiple contracts for each area based upon proposed design and within funding limitations.

Suppliers will be pre-qualified in one or more areas based upon their ability to identify, design and mature next generation material handling technology or systems.  Only those suppliers who wish to be a prime contractor need respond to this announcement.  Prequalified suppliers are companies or individuals whose record of performance in the marketplace (commercial or government or both) has demonstrated their ability to perform to consistently high standards of quality and reliability.

The prequalified suppliers list will remain in effect for a five year period and will be used for next generation development activities as well as establishing a qualified base for equipment production for a large national deployment. The Postal Service may consider additional suppliers for pre-qualification during this five year period based upon their ability to demonstrate they are companies or individuals whose record of performance in the marketplace (commercial or government or both) has shown their ability to perform to consistently high standards of quality and reliability.  Any entity seeking pre-qualification after the initial list of pre-qualified suppliers has been established must provide the same prequalification information for evaluation and such entity will be subject to the same evaluation criteria set forth below.  Manufacturers and/or design firms possessing all of the necessary analytical, engineering, bread boarding, prototyping, manufacturing and logistical support capabilities will form the qualified base for directed contracts based upon concepts provided.  Selection of equipment to be developed will be at the sole discretion of the United States Postal Service who reserves the right not to award, or to award a single or multiple contracts for a concept based upon anticipated savings if deployed on a nationwide basis.  Unsolicited proposals in these areas will be evaluated and each considered independently.

Participants in this effort will provide full logistics support for all equipment developed including training, spares, maintenance manuals and documentation according to standard commercial practices which will be disclosed and negotiated prior to award.
Suppliers will be pre-qualified in one or more of the following areas:  1a)  network/workflow simulation and financial analysis in dock, receipt/dispatch operations, 1b) and or logistics support;  2) equipment design, prototyping and pre-production capabilities; 3) ability to support a large national deployment of equipment; and 4) all of the above.
Your qualification statement should address each evaluation factor in the order listed.  Your submission must be in sufficient detail to adequately address each factor.  Include your e-mail address, contact person name and telephone number, company name, and mailing address with your submission.  Also provide a list of relevant references including both USPS (if applicable) and all other.
For consideration for prequalification, the potential supplier must provide the following information for evaluation:  1)  Identify the area (1a, 1b, 2, 3 or 4) in which the supplier is seeking prequalification.  2)  Provide the program name(s) for work completed relating to the area in which you are seeking prequalification and provide sufficient information to show that your company was involved in this area and identify the percentage of that effort for which your company was responsible.  For each reference listed provide the company name, contact person, telephone number, contract number and dollar value.  3.)  Address each of the following evaluation factors which are listed in descending order of importance.  

Technical Capability - Demonstrate the capability of your company to perform in one or more of the prequalification areas.

Program Management - Demonstrate the capability of your company to manage a program of the type for which you are seeking prequalification.

Past Performance:  Timeliness - Consistent on time delivery and adherence to contract schedules including the administrative aspects of performance.  Quality - documented quality system appropriate for the prequalification area including demonstrated quality initiatives, conformance to contract requirements, standards of good workmanship, and reliability of goods and/or services.

Cost Control - A record of forecasting and containing costs.

Supply Chain Management - The management of total material flow from all levels of subcontractors (may not be applicable for suppliers seeking qualification for 1a).

Business Relations - A history of being reasonable and cooperative with customers; commitment to customer satisfaction; integrity and ethics.

To be considered capable the supplier must:

Have the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, technical skills, and production and property controls.

Have, or have the ability to obtain, resources (financial, technical, etc.) adequate to perform the work.

Have, or have the ability to develop, a sound quality control program that complies with the task requirement or the solicitation requirements.  Solicitations which may be release to prequalified vendors will have preference over the general task prequalification for quality.

Have, or have the ability to obtain, the necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities.

Be able to meet delivery schedules, considering all existing commitments, including awards pending.
 
Responses shall be not more than 20 single pages (three copies) and shall be provided within 30
days after the date this notice is published and should be addressed to:  Ms. Paola Izzo, U.S Postal Service, Material Handling CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Merrifield, VA 22082-8150.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab plans to conduct a concept demonstration of a commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) or emerging technology capable of standardizing and automating the current method of calculating the weight and balance of Mobility Air Forces (MAF) aircraft prior to each flight.  MAF aircraft include C-5, C-17, and C-130 cargo aircraft and KC-10 and KC-135 tanker aircraft.  MAF loadmasters and boom operators currently calculate aircraft weight and balance by utilizing hand-written computations and technical data charts.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The system must operate on a COTS electronic handheld information device such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) and should be Windows Pocket PC OS based or compatible.  Current aircraft load planning form information must be auto-calculated and the system must perform calculations based on the aircraft specific loading charts and graphs to include hazardous material (HAZMAT).  The system must be capable of accepting data while moving about the aircraft and store all structural loading limitations and aircraft configuration data currently contained in aircraft technical data.  For ease of operation, the system must have drop down menus and be capable of readily accepting system upgrades.  The system must alert the loadmaster or boom operator if input data is out of limits or creates an out-of-limits condition.  The system must have synchronization capability and be compatible with a wide range of printers.  It must be capable of transferring files to other devices via cable connections and/or infrared beam and be capable of uploading weight and balance data directly to the aircraft mission data computer(s).  Interface with other load plan programs such as CALM (Computer Automated Load Manifesting) and ALPS (Automatic Load Planning System) is desired.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding will be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Mobility Command. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 8 November 2002.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Please use the following guidelines when submitting white papers: a) TECHNICAL APPROACH.  Please provide a brief high-level technical description of the proposed Weight & Balance system (no more than 1-2 pages).  Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system.  If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged (soft copies preferred).  b) RISKS.  Briefly address all potential risks.  Does the system rely on the performance of subcontractors?  c) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.  Describe the type of training that will be required to operate your system?  How long will the training take?  Briefly summarize how personnel would deploy and operate the system.  d) COMPATIBILITY. Explain system compatibility.  Describe the proposed system?s communication protocol.  Are there limitations?  e) ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING.  State the type of environmental testing that has been performed on the system.  What are the temperature and humidity limits within which the system will function properly?  f) COST.  What is the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed system, including low volume production numbers and high volume production numbers?  g) AVAILABILITY.  Provide system availability information.  Is it available off-the-shelf right now?  Can it be made available within three months?  h) PREVIOUS WORK.  Briefly explain any previous work you have done or are doing for military/civilian customers similar to what this BAA addresses (include demonstration information that supported that work).  Refer technical questions and submit product information to: Mr. Steven Fuller of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at fullers@ctc.com or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab plans to conduct a concept demonstration of a commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) or emerging radar technology that can be used to support a wide area air traffic control (ATC) facility in areas with no ATC radar capability.  Currently, military remote area air traffic control is conducted procedurally by the use of strict slot times, routes, and altitudes.  This reduces the flexibility to react to changes, aircraft malfunctions, thunderstorms, etc.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) looks at the use of radar technology to allow military controllers to monitor aircraft position, altitude, and transponder code on a windows based computer to ensure aircraft lateral and vertical separation.  The system would be set up in areas with no radar to provide enroute separation from other aircraft.  It must also be secure so that only registered users have access to the information.  The system should require minimum setup time as well as require minimal training to deploy and operate.  It should be of minimum size, weight, and cost and be air transportable on C-130 aircraft.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration. The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding will be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Mobility Command. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 8 November 2002.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Please use the following guidelines when submitting white papers: a) TECHNICAL APPROACH.  Please provide a brief high-level technical description of the proposed Air Traffic Control system (no more than 1-2 pages).  Ideally, the technical approach should include a scenario illustrating the use of the proposed system.  If applicable, pictures of the system are encouraged (soft copies preferred).  b) RISKS.  Briefly address all potential risks.  Does the system rely on integration capabilities of other systems?  Does the system rely on the performance of subcontractors?  c) TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.  Describe the type of training that will be required to operate your system?  How long will the training take?  Briefly summarize how ground personnel would deploy and operate the system.  d) COMPATIBILITY. Explain system compatibility.  Can it be networked to work with other systems?  e) WEIGHT/DIMENSIONS.  In keeping with the Air Force?s goal of minimal size and weight, state the approximate weight of the system and the approximate dimensions.  f) ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING.  State the type of environmental testing that has been performed on the system.  What are the temperature and humidity limits within which the system will function properly?  g) COST.  What is the estimated cost or cost range of the proposed system, including low volume production numbers and high volume production numbers?  h) AVAILABILITY.  Provide system availability information.  Is it available off-the-shelf right now?  Can it be made available within three months?  i) PREVIOUS WORK.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop a technology proposal in response to the announcement below.  Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) released a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NRA-02-OES-04 on August 26, 2002 to solicit proposals in support of the Earth Science Enterprise's Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) Program.  This NRA solicits both hardware and/or software technology proposals in any of the following four information system technology categories: (1) On-board satellite data processing; (2) Space-based communication networks, (3) Mission automation; (4) High end computing technologies for modeling; which have the highest potential to meet goals of this NRA and the capability requirements of the Office of Earth Science.	Successful proposers must present concepts which have great potential to identify, develop and (where appropriate) demonstrate advanced information system technologies which:	enable new Earth observation measurements and information products, increase the accessibility and utility of Earth science data, and reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time of Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) space-based and ground-based information systems.  The AIST program will competitively select through a peer review process proposals to participate in the program. The total proposed period of performance should not exceed 36 months.  NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the AIST program to develop a proposal and execute development and performance demonstrations of Information Technology (IT) advances in collecting, handling, and managing very large amounts of data and information in space and on the ground.  It is expected that selection of the proposal(s) and availability of funds would result in device and/or subsystem contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA.  Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide subsystems and devices consistent with the efforts synopsized for the LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential government, industry, and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, and availability of key personnel:   This criteria evaluates the proposer's relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included.  (2) Cost and schedule control:   This criteria evaluates the proposer's ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.  (3) Facilities:   This criterion evaluates the proposer's facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.  Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Darlene Pokora, Mail Stop 214, Building 1229, Room 120H, Hampton, VA 23681.  The preferred method of submission is via email to: &lt;d.c.pokora@larc.nasa.gov&gt;. The due date for submission is COB October 25, 2002. Procurement questions should be directed to Mary Jane Yeager, NASA LaRC Procurement Office, 757-864-2473, &lt;m.j.yeager@larc.nasa.gov&gt;. Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Jeffrey Herath (see below), or to Darlene C. Pokora at the email address noted above, phone # (757) 864-7511.  The technical requirements and NASA LaRC point of contact for technical questions is provided below:  Radiation Tolerant Intelligent Memory Stack (RTIMS) Technical Point of Contact: Mr. Jeffrey Herath, (757)864-1098, j.a.herath@larc.nasa.gov  The long-term objective of this effort is the development of a prototype device and demonstration of the effectiveness of an intelligent stacked memory array for enabling greatly enhanced on-orbit computing and data product generation capabilities. For this AIST program we propose to develop a working intelligent stacked memory array and demonstrate the feasibility of an eventual space-based mission via environmental testing.  Responses are solicited from potential AIST program partners who can demonstrate the capabilities and experience to design, manufacture and test heterogeneous chip stack devices.  In addition potential partners interested in reconfigurable computing applications are invited to respond. Selected partners will be expected to work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to perform some or all of the following tasks:   Design and manufacture the intelligent stacked memory array, RTIMS   Obtain suitable integrated circuits   Perform initial functional tests   Assist the integration of the device   Assist with environmental testing, evaluation and deviation resolution.  RTIMS General Description:      A stacked memory device providing 2 Gigabits of storage, organized in 16 bit words.  Each memory word will require 8 additional bits for Error Detection And Correction (EDAC).  The memory type should be Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) as most data will be written sequentially.  Further a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) (and any additional circuits required by the FPGA to start i.e., EEPROM) are also incorporated into the stack.  The FPGA design within the stack implements the control logic for using the SDRAMs as a general purpose bank of memory without worrying about selecting rows, columns, banks, refresh cycles and EDAC circuitry.  These functions are transparent to the user of the RTIMS.  The FPGA must be in stack reprogrammable.  NASA Langley will develop the FPGA code.  The FPGA selected will need to be equivalent in size to 32k gates of an Actel FPGA.  The RTIMS will need to be rated for 100K RAD (total dose) and be destructive latch-up immune.  Single Event Upsets (SEUs) will be corrected by EDAC and logged while dual upsets will be detected by EDAC and logged.  The height of the RTIMS should be 300 mils or less.

Partners selected under this synopsis will participate in the development of a proposal to the anticipated In-Space Propulsion Technologies, Cycle 2, ROSS 2002 NRA. 2.  Plasma Sails - Computational Studies of Fundamental Interactions and Processes Technical Point of Contact: James M. Corliss, 757-864-7627, j.m.corliss@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is developing analysis capabilities and methods for conducting computational studies related to predicting the performance and behavior of plasma sail propulsion systems.  Specifically, NASA Langley is developing capabilities to analyze the thermal response and thermal balance of plasma sails.  Langley is seeking partners with the additional computational capabilities required to more fully model and study the potential capabilities of plasma sail concepts.	Potential partner(s) must work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners, and have analytical capabilities in the following computational areas:	Kinetic and fluid computational models of solar wind interaction with an artificial magnetosphere with emphasis on system performance equilibrium conditions, and possible instabilities.  Computational studies of plasma sail fundamental processes such as plasma expansion of an artificial magnetosphere, plasma sources, self-consistent current generation, plasma losses, neutral interaction, and magnetic field production.  Global stability of artificial magnetospheres.  Langley is strongly interested in partners that have access to and experience in conducting laboratory investigations that would validate the plasma sail computational methods and analytical tools developed under this effort.   Partners selected under this synopsis will participate in the development of a proposal to the anticipated In-Space Propulsion Technologies, Cycle 2, ROSS 2002 NRA. 3. Integrated Solar Sail Diagnostics Package Technical Point of Contact: Mr. Richard S. Pappa, 757-864-4321, r.s.pappa@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners with which to develop extremely lightweight, unobtrusive, low-power sensors and data networks for in-space structural measurement of large area structures such as solar sails. Partners are also sought with expertise in membrane structural mechanics and dynamics, ground test methods for large thin-film membrane structures, photogrammetric analysis and simulation methods, and custom photogrammetry software development.   Structural parameters of interest for in-space measurement include deployment dynamics, deployed shape, deployed vibration properties, sail tension, sail film and boom stresses, sail temperature, and sail integrity. Measurement technologies include, but are not limited to, photogrammetry and videogrammetry, laser scanners or trackers, embedded fiber optic sensors, miniature local GPS networks, accelerometers, load cells, strain gages, and thermistors. Data networks include miniature wireless, fiber-optic, storage, and transmission technologies. Selected technologies will be integrated at NASA and used to test multiple 400 m2 ground test articles in the 2003-2005 timeframe. The measurement system must be evolvable to a mass of less than 2.0 Kg for in-space use on a 5000 m2 sail. Partners selected under this synopsis will participate in the development of a proposal to the anticipated In-Space Propulsion Technologies, Cycle 2, ROSS 2002 NRA. 4. Solar Sail Computational Modeling Technology Technical Point of Contact POC: Jonathan Ransom, 757-864-292, j.b.ransom@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is actively involved in solar sail development for the potential of providing cost effective, propellantless propulsion systems for future space explorations.  Large gossamer structures such as solar sails are often folded and packaged into a small volume for launching and then deployed in space using inflation deployment systems.  Existing ground-testing facilities are not adequate to replicate the space-environment of full-scale solar sails, necessitating ground-test correlation of deployment and on-orbit performance with analysis using sub-scale components.  Existing computational tools for deployment and shape characterization of solar sails are insufficient for these structures due to the slow analysis time and other computational challenges. Hence, the Center envisions developing high fidelity, advanced computational models and integrated multi-disciplinary analysis tools to provide detailed analytical predictions appropriate for ground-test, deployment, and on-orbit performance for solar sail missions.  Specifically, NASA plans to develop efficient analytical tools capable of predicting the shape and response of solar sails.  The Center is therefore seeking partners with which to develop advanced analysis technology to meet these needs.  The technologies solicited include (but are not necessarily limited to) finite element models and methodology, dynamic deployment simulation, software development and experimental testing.  Partners selected under this synopsis will participate in the development of a proposal to "In-space Propulsion Technologies" program element of the anticipated NASA Research Announcement entitled "Research Opportunities in Space Science (ROSS) 2002 Program".

<SUBJECT>P--Vessel Defueling and Tank Cleaning
<DESC>VESSEL DEFUELING AND TANK CLEANING PROGRAM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT The U.S. Deptartment of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), South Atlantic Region (SAR), maintains a ship stowage facility for merchant and Navy ships at the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF), located on the James River at Fort Eustis, VA. These ships have become obsolete due to age, and contain various quantities of fuels, oils, lubricants, oily water, and ballast water in their tanks.  Some of the fuel tanks have leaks due to steel deterioration. As a result of significant interest from the industry during the past year, MARAD plans to solicit proposals for innovative approaches to environmentally safe and economically feasible fuel removal and/or tank cleaning of obsolete vessels at JRRF.  The solicitation will be a Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA).  This PRDA will require identification of the types of petroleum products, total quantity of product, chemical analysis of the product, removal of the products from the vessel, and transportation of the removed products to a disposal facility or recycling facility. In addition to conventional fuel removal, disposal and tank cleaning techniques, innovative solutions will be invited that employ modern environmentally safe technology.  These include, but are not limited to, safe chemical or bio-remediation techniques that dispose of residual fuel and other petroleum products from the tanks. Offerors may respond to one or both parts (defueling or tank cleaning) for any or all of the obsolete JRRF vessels containing petroleum products or oily water.  Part of the cost of this project will be offset by the resale value of the petroleum products removed from the vessels.  Cost effective proposals that target the vessels with high priority status will be more desirable.  Proposals that are evaluated to be feasible and cost-effective will be considered for a pilot program for proof of concept and performance. The future issuance of any contract for fuel removal or tank cleaning is dependent upon the availability fo funding.  It is expected that the PRDA for this work will be issued on the FedBizOps website. during the first quarter of FY 2003.

<DESC>NA Title:  PMCD Technology Workshop Date:  January 29-30, 2003 Location:  Richlin Ballroom, 1700 Van Bibber Road, Edgewood, Maryland Host:  Program Manager for Chemical Demilitarization Facilitator:  Science Applications International Corporation The mission of the U. S. Armys Program Manager for Chemical Demilitarization (PMCD) is to safely dispose of the chemical warfare materiel at stockpile and non-stockpile sites.  To support this mission, PMCD is actively seeking, monitoring, and evaluating all technologies appropriate for integration into the demilitarization processes.  One aspect of this activity is the organization of a Technology Evaluation Workshop to facilitate the exchange of information among experts from industry, academia, and the government.  The objective of the meeting is to clarify PMCDs technical needs and to enable technology owners/providers to present potential solutions.  Vendors and research organizations are requested to submit presentation proposals on the following topics: 1.	Monitoring of Agent and Non-Agent Emissions:  Presentations will focus on the challenges posed by potential new Airborne Exposure Levels (AEL), other expected changes in regulatory monitoring requirements, and the need to detect agent in complex liquid,  gas and solid waste streams that include agent hydrolysate and other waste from plant operations and closure activities.  Of particular interest are continuous emission monitors, front-end sampling systems, innovative monitoring technologies for multi-age nt detection, and non-invasive agent assessment.  2.	Closure of Chemical Demilitarization Facilities:  Presentations will include technologies that address the decontamination and disposal phases of the shutdown of a chemical agent treatment plant.  Issues of primary interest are secondary waste treatment  and disposal, means and verification of equipment and building decontamination, disposal of contaminated equipment, concrete removal and collection, and processing of munitions residues.

<SUBJECT>NAVICP use of Qualification Requirements for Catapult Trough Covers
<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) intends to procure and refurbish a family of items found in the steam catapult systems of aircraft carriers using a qualification requirement per the provisions of FAR 9.2.  The items are commonly called catapult trough covers.  Catapult trough covers are a critical part of the steam catapult systems.  Usually 106 of the six-foot long covers are needed to equip just one catapult.  The trough covers make up the top of the flight deck over the catapult and contain a C channel under the deck that the shuttle rides during launching.  The shuttle connects to a steam-powered ram that pushes the landing gear of the aircraft during the launch.  The covers are made of high strength steel and weigh over a ton.  There are critical dimensions on the cover that have tolerances measured in the thousands of an inch.  If the cover is not in dimensio nal conformance, a failed launch may occur and there is a strong possibility that a flight crew could be lost.  This is a difficult item to manufacture and refurbish. When the NAVICP purchases new catapult trough covers or contracts for the refurbishment of catapult trough covers, only sources that have been approved under the qualification requirements will be considered for award. Contractors interested in manufacturing and/or refurbishing catapult trough covers may request a copy of the specification and drawing package from the Contract Specialist at NAVICP: Naval Inventory Control Point Code 0211.9 5450 Carlisle Pike, PO Box 2020 Mechanicsburg PA 17055 Ph. (717) 605-4255   Email jerome_burston@icpmech.navy.mil Or from the engineering activity, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Code 4.8.10.1 Highway 547 Lakehurst, NJ  08733-5090 Ph. (732) 323-2150 Email kenneth.nilsson@navy.mil The applicable specifications are: NAWCADLKE-MISC-48J100-0019 for manufacturing new trough and NAWCADLKE-MISC-48J100-0045 for refurbishment. Due to the military critical technology contained in the specifications and drawings, a completed and approved DD Form 2345, entitled Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, must accompany the contractors request for documents.  If a contractor desires to be qualified in the refurbishment of the catapult trough covers, the Government will provide a catapult trough cover in need of refurbishment.  Currently the NAVICP does not have any trough covers that can be refurbished.  Once trough covers that can be refurbished are available, they will be provided to all the firms interested in pursuing qualification. All further actions regardin g the qualification process will be between the contractor and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst (NAWCADLKE).  The Navy anticipates that any qualification will be done outside of any contract vehicle.  The approximate time period following submission of a product for qualification testing within which the applicant will be notified whether the product passed or failed the qualification testing will be established and coordinated by NAWCADLKE.  When a product is submitted for qualification testing, the applicant must furnish any specific information that may be requested of the manufacturer before testing will begin. Once a contractor becomes qualified, NAWCADLKE will notify NAVICP.  At that point the newly qualified firm will be included on the mailing list for any trough cover solicitations and will be considered for possible contract award.  The NAVICP h as been awarding contracts subject to the qualification requirement since mid 2002.
