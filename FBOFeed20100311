<DESC>The Government proposes to award a 7 month bridge Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for Dehumidifier, Desiccant manufactured by Munters Corporation with an estimated total value of $540,052.00. The current IQC contract was awarded March 16, 2007 with a one year base and two one year options. This bridge contract would cover NSN 4440-01-190-6213. The item is a desiccant dehumidifier used to cool the process air booster fan assembly on an Ohio Class SSBN trident Nuclear Submarine. It is the only known desiccant dehumidifier which meets the Navy's stringent vibration and noise specifications for drying out the submarine' missile tubes. There are no known substitutes or similar items that meet the Government's minimum needs. The Government does not possess complete unrestricted technical data to compete this item. The proposed bridge contract is necessary to provide continuous support to the war fighter until award of the follow on long term contract. To attempt to initiate a new acquisition and award a new contract for the 7 month period between the expiration of Munters' current contract and the award of the follow on fixed quantity contract is not feasible. Such a strategy would create a disruption in meeting the critical requirements of DSCP customers. A new Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity acquisition is in the planning stage with a 2 year base with three one-year options. The issuance of this bridge contract effective until October 15, 2010 will allow time for award of a new follow-on contract and full implementation by the potential awardee.

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought – Wayne County, Nebraska


The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Wayne, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 4173 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3975 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 5/1/2011. The delineated area is bounded or affronted on the

South - 	855th Rd; Hwy 15/576th Ave/Main St; 854th Rd
East - 	Centennial Rd
West – 	575th Ave/Pheasant Run

Other applicable requirements include:

• 33 paved surface parking spaces including 8 official vehicles
• Specific Information Technology requirements

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

•	Building ownership information.
•	Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA) has a requirement for the National Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), The Division of Intramural Research (DIR) for consulting services to produce Recombinant AAV Vectors and test for neutralizing antibodies in serum samples. 

The reference solicitation number is:   NHLBI-PB-(DE)-2010-099-DDC.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
Sjogren’s Syndrome is a systemic, chronic autoimmune disease of unknown ideology which affects 1-3million Americans primarily affecting the lacrimal and salivary glands. Patients complain of dry eyes and dry mouth the latter leading to pain, discomfort, dental carries, and infection of the mouth by opportunistic pathogens. Women are 9 times more likely than men to be affected in the general population.  There are currently no affective therapies for treating this disease.  

 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT:
The Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch (MPTB), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) requires the services of a consultant with expertise in performing adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector production and test for neutralizing antibodies in serum samples.  This expertise is necessary in order to expand upon our current studies in patients suffering from Sjögren’s Syndrome.  

Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by exocrine gland dysfunction primarily involving the salivary and lacrimal gland. The histologic hallmark of Sjögren’s Syndrome is a periductal inflammatory infiltrate. The conventional explanation of salivary gland dysfunction assumes a causal relationship between this chronic inflammatory process and the decreased saliva production. However, most patients have preserved salivary gland tissue and in overall the correlation between the focus score on SG biopsy (a measure of inflammation) and saliva production is limited. Recent studies have suggested that some immunomodulatory proteins may have beneficial effects in animal models of the disease and warrant further testing.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:
The specific tasks to be performed are to prepare and analyze samples from Sjogren’s patients or test animals for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to different serotypes of AAV vectors and to produce recombinant stocks of vectors.  The Contractor shall research data, including results obtained through the testing process, as well as other relevant patient data. The Contractor is responsible for the collection and the maintenance on a daily basis in the laboratory of Molecular Physiology and Therapeutics Branch (MPTB) on site in Building 10.

<p>1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>As a part of the U.S. Public Health Service under the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the Federal Government's primary biomedical research agency. Its mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. Helping to lead the way towards medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives, the NIH scientist investigate ways to prevent disease as well as the causes, treatments, and even cures for common and rare diseases. Composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, the NIH provides leadership and financial support to researchers in every state and throughout the world.</p>
<p>The world's largest clinical research hospital is a complex of buildings on the NIH campus, known as Building 10 or the Clinical Center Complex (CCC). With the original Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center at the hub, over the years the complex expanded from its original 1951 structure to encompass important additions. The latest is the new Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, which includes 350 flexible patient bed modules that function as inpatient beds and day hospital stations; research laboratories; a Vivarium; animal surgery suite; offices; hospital support services; and radiation oncology.</p>
<p>Portions of the original Building 10 facility are no longer capable of supporting modern research. The infrastructure is undersized, exceeded its useful life and must be replaced with modern state-of-the-art equipment to provide sufficient and reliable support for research. With the completion and occupancy of the new Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, portions of the original Building 10 are now vacated in sufficient quantities to begin a phased renovation.</p>
<p>1.1 Project Phasing</p>
<p>The proposed project is an incremental renovation of the F Wing of Building 10 (Floors 2-14) on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. Due to partial occupancy of some areas within the F wing and funding sources, the project is designed to be accomplished in phases. Phase A and B are defined in detail on the Drawings and specifications. In general:<br /><br />Phase A consists of converting 64,000 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 2 through 5 to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas and to install new utilities infrastructure; the infrastructure work will support the renovation of the entire F-Wing and will include the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 4 and 14. Phase A also includes installation of mechanical equipment on the 14th floor and treatment tanks on Floor B-1 and related alterations/piping on Floors 1 and B-2.</p>
<p><br />Phase B consists of the conversion of 151,600 gross square feet of former patient care units on F-Wing floors 6 through 13, to accommodate laboratories, lab support and administrative areas; work includes the installation of mechanical equipment on floors 9, 13, and 14. Phase B also includes fit-out of north corridor areas of floors 2 through 5 not constructed in Phase A.<br />The balance of the spaces within Phase B will become available for renovation as follows: <br /><br />&bull; Floors 6,7 North Corridor and spaces north of the North Corridor available Oct. 2012 (except as noted below)<br />&bull; Floor 9 with the exception of three modules on the East side of the 9th Floor North Corridor are available at the time of award. The three modules on Floor 9 will not be available until September 2013. We will work with the selected contractor to improve availability of this space.<br />&bull; Floors 8, 10-13 North Corridor and spaces north of the North Corridor available Apr. 2013 (portions of 8, 10, 13 are available Oct. 2012). (except as noted below)<br />&bull; The utilities in the shaft at the north wall of the West 6 modules must remain in place and operational until the 6 West Modules are vacated on all floors, 2-13. Upon the space becoming available the existing shaft and risers can be demolished and the new risers and shaft wall constructed.</p>
<p>1.2 Project goals:</p>
<p>&bull; To provide a reliable, efficient, flexible, and adaptable facility that best suits its unique user requirements.<br />&bull; To develop a functional and conducive clinical research environment to ensure a high quality of life for staff, and an environment that attracts and retains world-class researchers.<br />&bull; To execute the Project at the most reasonable cost to the Government <br />&bull; To complete the Project in the most efficient and expeditious manner.<br />&bull; To minimize the disruption caused by the Project to ongoing NIH functions</p>
<p><br />1.3 Project funding</p>
<p>There are two major funding sources for the CQM Services to renovate the F Wing. Phase A CQM Services will be funded through normally appropriated funds and Phase B CQM Services will be funded using ARRA funding authorities. It is important that strict accounting protocols be maintained to ensure that the proper funding source is used for each Phase of CQM Services. The CQM contract will be awarded as a five-year contract to perform Phase A services with a five-year Option to perform Phase B services. It is anticipated that the Phase B Option will be exercised shortly after the contract award.</p>
<p>1.3.1 Phase A is the Base Contract and will be paid for by normally appropriated funds. The scope of the CQM in support of Phase A includes: Phase A Preconstruction Services; Phase A Renovation Services; Phase A Activation / Occupancy Services; and Phase A Closeout Services.</p>
<p>1.3.2 Phase B is an Option and will be financed by ARRA funding authorities. The scope of the CQM in support of Phase B includes: Phase B Preconstruction Services; Phase B renovation Services; Phase B Activation / Occupancy Services; and Phase B Project Closeout Services.</p>
<p><br />1.4 CQM Contract Elements</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure two (2) Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) pads of Helipad 3D from Heusker Inc. in support of Operation Iraq Freedom (OIF) and the ramp up of efforts in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The dry and dusty environments create havoc for a helicopter pilot during landings and takeoffs.  Pilots easily lose visual reference as the sand and dirt are kicked up and engulf the aircraft.  This occurrence, which often results in aircraft and crewmember loss, is referred to as a brownout.  Brownouts are commonplace for pilots landing to a Landing Zone (LZ) site without lightweight mat pad.  It is the lightweight mat that suppresses the dirt and dust while still allowing the pilot to operate in a safe condition.  An RFI  was synopsized on 23 June 2009 under N68335-09-RFI-7101.  Five responses were received.  Heusker Inc. was the only firm who supplied a sample mat that passed the testing.  Small product samples were submitted with the RFI.  Now a larger VTOL pad is needed to conduct further testing.  The Government intends to procure these items under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (3) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3.

A sources sought was issued October 2, 2009, under N6258309RSSA1 for the below requirement in determining the extent that small businesses are available to provide solutions to Government needs. Specialty Center Acquisitions, NAVFAC (SCAN), Port Hueneme, California, is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation N62583-10-R-0318 for Research and Development (R&D). The resulting contracts will be a hybrid cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF), firm-fixed-price (FFP), indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ), Multiple Award Contract (MAC) for Research and Development in support of the US Navy Energy-Savings Technology Validation program, and other Navy and Federal government programs, worldwide.

THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING RESERVED FOR COMPETITION UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 52.219-6 NOTICE OF TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The Government will only accept offers from small business concerns. It is anticipated that up to five contracts will be awarded under the pending solicitation. The resulting contracts will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods. The minimum guarantee for each contract is $10,000. The maximum contract value of $25,000,000 is the cumulative amount for all contracts awarded under the pending solicitation N62583-10-R-0318, and not the maximum value of an individual contract.  The total value of all orders placed under contracts awarded under the solicitation will not exceed 25,000,000 notwithstanding any language in the solicitation or contract to the contrary. The Energy and Utilities Division of NAVFAC ESC plans to solicit research and development (R&D) services with an emphasis on testing and demonstration of potential new products or improvements in existing products or services. The purpose of the resulting Demonstration Validation (DemVal) contracts is to investigate and validate energy saving technologies that are either newly introduced to the commercial market or that are on the market, but that are not widely used by the U.S. Navy and other Federal agencies. Additionally, some technologies may still be in the early phases of research & developmental and not economically viable at this time. Examples of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies that may be demonstrated are Photovoltaic (PV) Shingles, Water Cooled Condensers, High efficiency HVACR Compressor, Extended Surface Air Filters, Aerosol Duct Sealing, HID Electronic Ballast, Microturbine. R&D services could mean demonstration of the entire system, or demonstration of components and subsystems of these technologies, or of other energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies not cited above.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to solicit Innovative Professional Solutions (IPS), 8317 Front Beach Road, Suite 17D, Panama City, FL 32407 on a sole-source basis for safety and production engineering support for the QUICKSTRIKE Mines Mod 3 program.  Support will include development of program safety documentation, Fuze Initiation System Technical Review Panel (FISTRP) support and production engineering support.  IPS is the only known source that possesses personnel with the following unique combination of capabilities:  (a) significant experience supporting the QUICKSTRIKE Mines Mod 3 program, including uninterrupted support for the past seven years, (b) experience providing safety support and developing safety documentation for the QUICKSTRIKE Mines Mod 3 program; (c) significant experience developing successful data packages and presentations for the WSESRB in support of Mine Warfare programs, including the QUICKSTRIKE Mines ! Mod 3 program, and (d) familiarity with the on-going production engineering efforts associated with the program.  IPS has developed all documentation related to the on-going safety investigation regarding Mk 65 Mod 3 hardware and their continued support of this effort is critical to successful completion/closure of the process.  It is estimated that getting another source trained and up to speed on this tasking would increase the cost to the Navy by as much as 100% and result in significantly decreased support effectiveness levels.  The NAICS Code for this effort is 541330, the SBA Size Standard is $27M, and the FSC Code is R425.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Theprojected period of performance of the proposed effort is 9 months.
This contract will be for similar services currently being provided for theNavyand Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) Program Office under N00178-04-D-4020-NS01 and will be used to provide continued service to support software changesrequired during the closeout of the NMCI Contract (N00024-00-D-6000) andbeginning of the follow-on Continuity of Services Contract.
The services currently being provided under N00178-04-D-4020-NS01 mustcontinue without interruption until all Fiscal Year 2011 orders for servicehavebeen placed under the CoSC, which has a scheduled performance start date of1 October 2010.  The CoSC has not yet been awarded and the requiredsoftware changes to NET and RAPT remain unknown.  Therefore, the exactscope of modifications to the NET and RAPT applications that will be requiredtosupport the transition from the NMCI contract to the CoSC are also unknown atthis time.  Once the CoSC is awarded, software modifications to the NET andRAPT tools will be rapidly identified, developed, and implemented to supportservice delivery starting 1 October 2010.  This software modification effortmustbegin immediately upon award of the CoSC.  Because Deloitte Consulting, LLPis the developer, tester, administrator, and manager of the software necessaryto integrate the upcoming changes in the time required, it is the only sourcethat possesses the capability to ensure continuity of NET and RAPTfunctionalityduring the transition from the NMCI contract to the CoSC.

<ARCHDATE>03112011
<CONTACT>JULIE ENGLEHART CONTRACT SPECIALIST 7036487306     ;

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for services related to the translation and use of technical information, developed in a study entitled "Effects of Urbanization of Stream Ecosystems" (EUSE) in a USGS Circular letter.  The study has been provided by Center for Watershed Protection (CWP) under contract with the USGS.  The USGS has now identified additional tasks to be performed in relation to that contract.  Key services include:  (1) summarizing management strategies for addressing the urban stream problems identified in the initial draft chapter of the EUSE Circular in a format suitable for inclusion in the Circular; (2) presenting and explaining management options as part of an EUSE-sponsored session at the 2010 National Water Quality Monitoring Council meeting in April 2010; (3) working with ESUE staff to translate findings from EUSE science reports into web-based media formats that effectively communicate key Circular ideas and concepts to a non-scientific audience.
The USGS believes that no other source can develop the three tasks above without having performed the original study.  Because there is urgency for the three tasks to be performed, the USGS cannot take the original study and train a new vendor on the subject matter.  Based on these facts the USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to CWP, unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes he has obtained similar technical expertise and can provide the same service in the time described.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contracting Officer, jenglehart@usgs.gov no later than 11:00 AM EST, Friday, March 19, 2010 with an affirmative answer.   

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:
The USGS NAWQA Program requests award of non-competitive procurement to CWP for assistance in providing services that are new and unexpected.  The nature of the project---translating technical science findings into a format useful to a non-technical audience, including city and county government officials with responsibilities for managing the quality of local stream ecosystems---is unusual for USGS scientists, who do not have expertise in assessing the types of materials that will be useful to these officials and other stakeholders.  At the beginning of the original agreement with CWP the EUSE staff did not anticipate several important realities.  First, over the last year, in meetings with stakeholders, stakeholders have expressed an interest in management suggestions tied to the science findings in chapters 1-7 of the draft circular.  They have also asked for formal presentations on the study at meetings such as the National Water Quality Management Council, where a large national audience of such officials gather.  Another unanticipated reality is the need for a long series of iterations in drafting the circular documents.  CWP expertise is needed to review the document at several more junctures than originally anticipated, again, due largely to the novelty of this effectively transmit project findings in diverse formats to our stakeholders.  
Because of the long-term investment of government funding resources with CWP, CWP uniquely meets performance requirements for publishing the study findings of the "Effects of Urbanization on Stream Ecosystems" in a timely and cost-effective manner.  CWP has unique qualifications in terms of their detailed understanding of the EUSE project and requirements for communicating project findings and will be able to complete the proposed work in a timely and efficient manner that will benefit the government.  Otherwise, a similar amount of staff time effort and contractor time would otherwise be needed to bring a new contractor up to speed on the project; this duplication of effort would be costly in terms of both funds in terms of the overall need to complete the project in FY11.  This would also result in receipt of a redundant service to bring another vendor up to the point of expertise currently found with CWP, which is not in the best interest of the USGS or the taxpayer.  At the conclusion of the project, CWP will have no exclusive rights to any data, publications, or copyrights; all project material will be publically available.

The CMA direction was that PM NSCM would assume full responsibility for the CDTF by the FY2011 completion of the PM CSE demilitarization mission.<BR><BR>The purpose of this special notice is to conduct a market survey of interested parties that may have capabilities and past experiences to respond to and comply with the overall objectives and requirements of the above CDTF umbrella SOW or submit proposals if a future competitive CDTF request for proposal is issued.<BR><BR>If all options are exercised, the ordering period under the CDTF basic contract will expire on 30 SEP 2011.  In accordance with DFARS 217.204(e)(i), the Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center, is planning to process a sole source extension to the CDTF ordering period from 30 Sep 2011 to 30 Sep 2014 and the overall period of performance would be extended from 30 Sep 2011 to 30 Sep 2015 in lieu of issuing a new, competitive follow-on acquisition.  As described in FAR 6.3021(a)(2)(iii), services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in either substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.<BR><BR>Please submit your interest in response to this special notice, and a description of your capabilities and past experiences to perform the above objectives and requirements contained in the CDTF umbrella statement of work.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source<br /><br />Reference # 2010-81018<br /><br />The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Spokane Research Laboratory (SRL), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently seeking source for companies that are compatible with the existing ISS microseismic monitoring. mining hardware and software. This award will be in accordance with FAR 13 using simplified acquisition procedures. It appears that ISS International Limited, P.O. Box 12603, Stellenbosch, South Africa, is the only company that meets the compatibility requirement for this project. If any company can meet the technical requirements below you are welcome to submit your capability statement as directed at the end of this advertisments.<br />Any organization or individual doing business with the government must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Follow link below for registration details.<br /><br />https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx.<br /><br />Performance Work Statement
<p>I. BACKGROUND<br />NIOSH is engaged in a detailed study of ground deformation mechanics at an underground coal mine as part of a mine safety research study to improve mine designs and reduce hazards under deep cover mining conditions. As part of the seismic monitoring component of this research effort, a close-in microseismic monitoring array was deployed by NIOSH at a deep operating longwall coal mine. This system had previously been acquired for use in research studies at NIOSH's experimental underground stone mine, previously been acquired fro use in research studies at NIOSH's experimental underground stone mine, which is now closed. In additional to the array of geophone sensors and station digitizers, the installed infrastructure includes remote power and timing systems, wired and wireless and wireless communications networks, and a central data acquisition and processing server. Data are streamed to the server in real-time and processed to provide microseismic event location coordinates and estimates of event magnitude and other source parameters which are then available over a password-protected Internet web page. Accuracy of the event locations and other calculated parameters is limited by the number of statios. The current station density does not allow event locations to be associated with individual mine pillars or other important geologic and mining structures. Additional monitoring stations are required in the much larger coal mining environment to increase the accuracy to resolve such structures and to increase the reliability of software-processed results.</p>
<p>II. Project Objectives<br />The Objective is to expand the current 5-station surface-based microseismic monitoring system to 20 stations distributed both on the surface and underground to increase event location accuracies and the reliability of the real-time automated processing results.</p>
<p>III. Scope of Work<br /><br />1. Provide additional microseismic system components and communication hardware and software.<br />2. Install additional components of microseismic system at the field site and demonstrate system functionality.<br />3. Provide 1-yr hardware and software maintenance and technical support<br />IV. Detailed Technical Requirements <br />Geophone digitizer, timing and communications hardware</p>
<p>This acquisition seeks hardware, software and communications infrastructure to support 15 additional microseisic stations plus additional components for one spare station (16 digitizing units and 12 geophones; four geophones already available).</p>
<p>All additional geophone, digitizer, timing and communications hardware shall be 100% electrically, mechanically, and software compatible with the existing ISS microseismic monitoring system installed at the field site and with other NIOSH ISS hardware not yet installed at the site.<br /><br />Eight other digitizers, six of which require GPS timing and two of which require network communication devices, shall be placed in positions with amle AC/DC power allowing 24-bit resolution and high-speed network communications. All digitizer shall be equipped with local USB storage devices.<br /><br />NIOSH will provide a fiber optic communications link between the surface and underground through which timing information and data can be transmitted. Additional hardware is required to provide the GPS time signals fro the underground stations. Hardware is also required to receive, and at the underground end of the fiber where 120VAC power shall be supplied, data communications from the digitizers. The following triaxail geophones are required: one 4.5Hz surface mount, three 14-Hz surface mount, and eight 14-Hz borehole units. The borehole geophones should be equipped for removable installation in 2.5-inch diameter holes. Geophones shall be equipped with electronics to determine polarity and measurement of orientation during installation.</p>
<p>(ii) Support</p>
<p>One year hardware, software, and technical support shall be provided for all new acquisitions and existing equipment at the field site.</p>
<p>(iv) Installations</p>

I. 	Background and Purpose of the WHI  

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) was established to elucidate the etiology and prevention of major causes of disability and death in older women (age range 50-79), namely cardiovascular disease, cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, and hip fractures. The program included three clinical trials in a partial factorial design (N=68,132) and a large observational study (N=93,677) for a total of 161,808 participants enrolled (17% minority). The program collected data on outcomes and exposures that span across most disease domains. During the first phase of the program (1993-2005) the three clinical trials and the concurrent observational study were completed. The trials of hormone therapy were stopped early, in 2002 for estrogen plus progestin because of harm for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), stroke, Venous Thrombo embolism (VTE) and breast cancer, and in 2004 for estrogen alone because of harm for stroke and VTE and lack of benefit for CHD. In an ancillary study, women over age 65 had an increased risk of dementia in both hormone arms. The trials of low fat dietary modification and of calcium and vitamin D continued to 2005 as planned.  

The currently ongoing renewal of WHI (2005-2010) enrolled 115,405 women (77% of those eligible) at 40 field centers. The post-stopping of therapy experience of the clinical trial participants in regard to trial exposures and clinical events are being monitored. The 3-year data after stopping estrogen plus progestin have been published, and the other trials will publish post-stopping data in 2010. The additional outcomes accrued in the observational study have been used to extend the clinical trial findings and are being utilized in several ancillary and consortium studies. The WHI data and biologic resources have been made widely available to the scientific community, and in particular two rounds of Broad Agency Announcements have funded 22 investigations utilizing the biologic samples. The current annual retention rate of the cohort is 98%.

II. 	WHI 2010-2015 Extension Study Objectives

A further 5-year observational WHI follow-up study is anticipated from October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2015. During this time, all WHI participants will be invited to provide informed consent for continued follow-up of clinical outcomes, return of study questionnaires, and willingness to be approached for future ancillary studies including clinical trials. It is estimated that a total of ~100,000 women (85% of living participants, projected age range 62-95 with 35% over age 80) will enroll in the 2010-2015 extension. 

While it is well known that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of death in American women, it is less appreciated that the vast majority of these deaths occur in older women (women over the age of 80). They account for an increasing proportion of the CVD morbidity and mortality, and suffer from a number of important phenotypes, which include diastolic heart failure, hypertension, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation. Elderly women comprise the most rapidly growing demographic in the US population, yet only ~4,500 women over the age of 80 are currently being following in other NHLBI cohort studies. The WHI has a very large cohort of older women with a demonstrated enthusiasm for clinical research; the cohort is rich in clinical, phenotypic, and genotypic data; and it is supported by a strong research infrastructure. This follow-up takes advantage of the WHI cohort and its investigators to launch the next generation of critically important cardiovascular research projects that target older women. The renewal plans to continue support for following the cohort from 2010-2015, with several modifications to enhance its scientific value. The depth of the follow-up will be increased for two important sub-cohorts (hormone trial participants, and African American and Hispanic participants with Genome- Wide Association Study (GWAS) data, N~24,000, with ~8,400 over age 80) but will be scaled back to collect self-reported data only for the remaining (~76,000) participants from the other study trials and the observational study. In addition to the continued follow-up of the hormone trial participants to evaluate long term effects of treatment, both the hormone trial and minority populations will serve as observational studies with a new focus on three CVD outcomes with substantial burden in older women (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and venous thromboembolism) while continuing current adjudication of CHD, stroke, cancer, and other outcomes. The combined hormone trial and minority GWAS cohorts will have substantial minority representation (~28% African American, 12% Hispanic, and 58% White).  

The CCC’s expected responsibilities that will continue during the follow up phase include (but are not limited to)  preservation of the WHI cohort and obtaining informed consent for ongoing participation; data management and analysis activities including the documentation and maintenance of appropriate confidentiality and security of files for the study and sub-studies; lead the development of the protocol and manuals of procedures development; continue to support a morbidity/mortality monitoring and adjudication system; maintain quality control and monitoring of the performance status of the field centers; maintain the biological specimen laboratory; solicit and monitor laboratories; coordinate, arrange, participate in, and provide any information necessary for regular Steering Committee, Observations Study Monitoring Board, training and other necessary study meetings; and provide technical reports as required by the Government.

The restructuring of the WHI field centers into up to 5 regional field centers will include funding for coordinating regional activities including, documentation of clinical outcomes, engaging investigators inside and outside current centers to propose analyses and ancillary studies, to perform distributed data analyses, and to train new investigators. Having a limited number of regional field centers will streamline study management and will facilitate ancillary studies within the region, and across regions, compared to having 40 field centers.

<DESC><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This announcement replaces solicitation number NIHES2009072.</strong></span></p>
<p>Preparation of the Report on Carcinogens</p>
<p>Type of requirement</p>
<p>Re-competition (Contract no. N01-ES-35505)</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small business; 8(a) small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712 for the proposed acquisition for which the small business size standard is 500 employees.  Responses to the information requested will assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is requesting information to determine the availability of interested businesses to compete for a contract that will provide support for the preparation of the Report on Carcinogens (RoC) and the background documents used in its scientific review process. The RoC is a Congressionally mandated document that identifies and discusses agents, substances, mixtures, or exposure circumstances (collectively referred to as "substances") that may pose a hazard to human health by virtue of their carcinogenicity.  The responsibility for preparing the RoC has been delegated to the National Toxicology Program. (NTP). Substances that are being considered by the NTP for possible listing or de-listing in the RoC (here referred to as candidate substances) are evaluated by a rigorous review process. Each background document summarizes all relevant exposure, regulatory and carcinogenicity information specific for a candidate substance. The goal of this contract is to provide support of NTP hazard identification activities targeted toward the prevention of diseases or adverse effects caused by environmental exposure to chemical or physical agents.</p>
<p><br />The propose contract tasks include: the preparation of the background documents and the preparation of the RoC. Both shall be measured by end products.   The Contractor shall conduct literature searches, draft technical summaries or reviews of the literature in textual and/or tabular format, checks the technical accuracy of the information, performs copy and scientific editing, and formats and compiles the information into a background document.  For some background documents, the Contractor may need to establish subcontracts with expert consultants (identified by the NTP RoC office) to draft or provide advice for sections in which the Contractor does not have adequate expertise.  The preparation of the background document project has two types of end products associated with it; the preparation of the final background documents (average 5 per year) and administrative support for the expert panel meetings (approximately 4 per year). The preparation of the RoC task requires the production of one type of end product; the RoC pre-publication draft.  Section 508 compliance will be applicable.</p>
<p><br />Task 1: Requires the completion of two types of end products, each of which represents a different step or subtask.  These two end products include:</p>
<p><br />1) Preparation and delivery of the expert panel drafts and the final background document (average 5 candidate substances per year) - (End product type 1).</p>
<p><br /> 2) Administrative support for the expert panel meetings (average 4 per year) - (End product type 2).</p>
<p><br />Task 2: Requires the preparation and delivery of the pre-publication draft of the RoC (estimated not to exceed 3 per the entire contract) - (End product type 3)</p>
<p><br />The RoC is a compilation of substance profiles that describe the carcinogenicity, exposure and regulatory information for each listing, relevant tables, appendices, indexes and supporting documents.  The preparation of the RoC, which is the final end product, shall be completed in three phases or sub-tasks.</p>
<p><br />1) Preparation of substance profiles for new listings<br />2) Updating substance profiles for current listings<br />3) Preparation of the preliminary and pre-publication drafts.</p>
<p><strong>Interested organizations should submit five (5) hard copies of their capability statement, not to exceed fifteen (15) pages in length, excluding standard brochures, for receipt by the agency by 4:00 p.m. ET on July 21, 2009.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).  NAVAIR is conducting a market survey of industry to determine potential interested sources that have the skills, experience, qualifications and knowledge required to successfully procure a Vertical Short Take-Off and Landing Optical Landing System (VSTOL OLS) in accordance with the objectives herein.  NAVAIR will use this RFI as a determination for size standards for possible future competitions.   A complete drawing package for the VSTOL OLS will be available and sent to interested parties upon request.  NAVAIR is requesting an estimated hardware delivery of 3/2014.  

Background:
When landing at night, visual cues play an integral part of the safe approach, hover and landing for the pilot of an aircraft, especially when heavy weather is present.  Therefore, additional visual landing aids have been developed by the U.S. Navy to assist helicopters and VSTOL aircraft to achieve safe landings on amphibious assault ships.  The VSTOL OLS provides an optimal glide path and trend information to the pilot upon approach and navigates the aircraft to a point 50 ft. above the flight deck at the stern of the ship.  A virtual image of a ball is aligned between two horizontal datum arm assemblies when the approach is on the optimum glide path.  The pilot is able to determine if they are coming in too high or too low as the ball transitions either above or below the datum arm lights.  The ‘ball’ will change in color if the approach is dangerously low.  The system is required to be dynamically stabilized to compensate for the ship’s pitch and roll motion, and be visible to a pilot up to 0.8 nautical miles out and at a ceiling of 200ft.  

Technical:
The VSTOL OLS consists of 14 separate units.  Major assemblies include two indicator boxes that contain stepper motors and various optics, an electronics enclosure containing various circuit card assemblies, an electrical enclosure with various power filtering and conversion devices, and a remote panel with additional circuit cards and control mechanisms.  Precision tooling is required to manufacture many of the parts, as the tolerances can be extremely tight.  The system provides a dynamically stabilized, for both ship pitch and roll, optical display to a pilot during landing approach.  The system requires 115VAC, 60Hz, 3-phase delta power to operate.  Additionally, system test equipment will need to be manufactured to perform diagnostics and acceptance testing prior to system delivery.  Drawings for the test equipment will be available when needed.   

Any documentation furnished is upon the condition that it or knowledge of it's possession will not be released to another nation without specific authority from the Department of the Navy of the United States; that it will not be used for other than military purposes; that individual or corporate rights originating in the information, whether patented or not, will be respected and; that the information will be provided the same degree of security afforded it by the Department of Defense of the United States.  Regardless of any other markings on this document, it may not be declassified or downgraded without the written approval of the originating U.S. agency.

Representatives of US companies who have subsidiaries in foreign countries expecting to participate will also be considered under foreign national rules.  

Since the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the drawing package is mailed.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 numbers) number and a company’s CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense. 

Submission Information:  Copies of the DD Form 2345 and written responses to this RFI are requested to be submitted by 12 April 2010 to Mr. David Andreoli, (732)-323-5208, Fax # (732)-323-7440.  Electronic responses are recommended and encouraged and should be submitted to the following email address: david.andreoli@navy.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a ?market search? for businesses in preparation for a future procurement.  Any interested firm should submit a Capabilities Statement with information which clearly demonstrates their capabilities to provide the services described below. Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   It is anticipated that any future contract for these services will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Level-of-Effort (LOE) type contract with five one-year periods, each period will have approximately 23,750 LOE hours including increased quantity options. The applicable NAICS code is 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services) with a size standard of $7 million.
The capabilities statement shall provide the firm?s current size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (large or small) and whether the firm is a SBA certified Hubzone or 8(a)/Small Disadvantaged contractor.  The firm shall also indicate if it is Woman-owned, Veteran-owned or Service-Disabled Veteran owned. As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. 
The EPA has a need for a firm to provide technical support for the BASINS (Better Assessment Science Integrating point and Nonpoint Sources) Application and the Water Quality Standards Program in support of the Standards and Health Protection Division (SHPD), under the Office of Science and Technology (OST) within EPA?s Office of Water (OW).  
SHPD has multiple responsibilities under the Clean Water Act of 1987 (CWA) to include directing the national program for adoption of Water Quality Standards, developing prevention and remediation strategies to reduce the risk to human health and aquatic life resulting from contaminated fish and sediment, and microbial pathogens in surface waters, providing technical support to the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program, and preparing outreach and awareness materials including developing instructional material and presenting workshops.  Many of SHPD?s efforts have benefited from the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies, which captures, stores, analyzes, manages, and presents data that are linked to a location; particularly as implemented in the application known as BASINS.  Over the past decade OW has managed the development of GIS technologies, capabilities, and databases to support programmatic activities.   The wide availability of GIS compatible data makes it possible to provide more complete data support for many water quality and watershed models which, assess and simulate water quality and flow, by linking the GIS-based data to the models integrated in BASINS.  
The PC-based GIS system is designed to be used by managers and analysts who need to work with spatial data but do not need to perform the more complex GIS manipulations. EPA has used such a system with appropriate GIS data layers and models to develop the BASINS application, which is useful in assessing the integrated effects of point and nonpoint pollutants releases on water quality.  BASINS provides techniques that may be used in many ways including selecting industries for study, delineating impacted aquatic ecosystems, prioritizing regulatory options, developing watershed assessments and nonpoint source controls, facilitating watershed-level National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting, and contributing to overall programmatic management.
Technical support services in the following task areas will be necessary for this effort:1.  Professional programming assistance for the BASINS application support and development 2.  Providing training, workshops, conferences specific to the various models and related computer operations3.  Technical support/instruction to the users of the water quality models4.  Develop methodologies and identify and obtain requisite data layers to fully support watershed assessment modeling analyses using BASINS technologies as appropriate5.  Technical support for developing web pages/sites, updating web-based materials, and other web-based features as appropriate to the support of the BASINS list serve
A contractor interested in submitting a capabilities statement in regard to this effort should specifically address sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 of the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) which can be obtained from the EPA?s Office of Acquisition Management website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  The successful contractor of any resultant contract will be expected to provide all necessary labor, materials, and facilities in support of the efforts delineated by the PWS.
Responses should be submitted to charlton.candice@epa.gov no later than 15 calendar days from the date of posting. A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposals (RFP), resulting from this Sources Sought Synopsis.

<DESC>A.	General Information.<BR><BR>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Digital Thermometers with Probe Covers (Oral and Rectal).<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is May 2010.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Digital Thermometers with Probe Covers (Oral and Rectal) product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Digital Thermometers with Probe Covers (Oral and Rectal) product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Digital Thermometeres with Probe Covers (Oral and Rectal) , which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $242,350.13.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses with (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.L.allen@amedd.army.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicians, Infection Control Officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  <BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:  <BR>1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Digital Thermometer with Probe Covers (Oral and Rectal) products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: Probe Covers for Digital Thermometer and Digital Thermometers (Oral and Rectal) with an oral probe and rectal probe.<BR>2.  List Products (Specific required sizes, models, items, types should be listed). Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.<BR>3.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Digital Thermometer with Probe Covers product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>4.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>5.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>6.  Vendors must provide Digital Thermometer with Probe Covers (Oral and Rectal) which measures temperature in Fahrenheit. <BR>7.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. <BR><BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by, 3 PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendors product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1.	Temperature reading displays on machine within 10 seconds.<BR>a. Allows user to get a quick and accurate reading.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting.<BR>c. Allows user to evaluate assessment of health status.<BR>2.	 Temperature display is easy to read.<BR>a. Temperature display is large, bright and clear.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting.	<BR>c. Allows user to note reading immediately after display.<BR>3.	 Probe has secure storage when not in use.<BR>a. Storing probe properly avoids contamination.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting.<BR>c. The user will store the probe securely.<BR>4.	 Probe cover fits securely to probe for use.<BR>a. Secure fit is necessary to reduce risk of cross contamination.	<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting.<BR>c. User will test to see if probe cover is secure<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 1 April 2010 3PM CDT.<BR>

Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>5.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. <BR>6.	 Suction canisters must be disposable.<BR>7.	Suction canisters are designed with a automatic overflow shutoff valve.<BR>8.	Suction canister lids lock. <BR>9.	Suction canisters are marked with measured graduations.<BR>10.	Designed for single patient use.<BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by, 3 PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendors product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for approximately 30 calendar days.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1.	Lids lock securely.<BR>a.	 Allows user to properly dispose of collected waste without spillage. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting.<BR>c.	Enhances worker safety during transport and disposal.<BR>2.	 Graduated marks are clearly visible on canister.<BR>a.	Clinicians require accurate measurement of output.  <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting.<BR>c.	 Allows user to visualize quantity of  output for patient assessment.<BR>3.	 Positive shut-off valve closes immediately when fluid reaches the top.<BR>a.   Clinicians will observe that shut-off valve functions as described.   <BR>b.   This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting. <BR>c.   This operation prevents overflow and prevents cross contamination of <BR>      regulators and wall outlets.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 1 April 2010 at 3PM CDT.<BR><BR>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHTThe purpose of this sources sought is to determine how many and what type of businesses are capable of performing the below described services and to determine whether or not a set-aside and which type, may be appropriate.If your company directly provides the below service, not through a subcontracting or similar arrangement, please contact this office and let us know your if you are interested in performing.You must respond Not Later Than:  March 17, 2010  to:  Gregory.Manning2@va.govIf you have any questions, please forward to the above email address.   CARDIAC HOLTER AND EVENT MONITORING SERVICESAT THE SOUTHERN ARIZONA VA HEALTH CARE SERVICE, TUCSON ARIZONA    1.  Scope of Work:  The contractor shall provide all labor, management, equipment, parts, transportation, facilities, materials, software, scanning services, electronic data transfer  and all other necessary elements required to provide complete Cardiac Holter and Event Monitoring Services for the Southern Arizona Veteran Affairs Health Care System (SAVAHCS), Tucson Arizona.    2.  Background:  As a result of the lack of appropriate equipment or trained personnel, SAVAHCS has previously contracted out this requirement in the commercial marketplace.   The need now exists again for continued in-house holter or event monitoring services for our patients. Event and holter monitoring services are a necessary component of a full service cardiology program and necessary to the provision of quality care to veterans.  This service allows the ability to make timely diagnosis of disorders related to cardiac rhythms.This process has proven to be a very cost-effective alternative to long stays in CCU and in-house telemetry monitoring.  Also, because the patient is performing routine daily activities, chances of documenting arrhythmias causing transient problems are greatly enhanced.  At the onset of a symptom (flutters, dizziness, presyncopal episodes, etc.), the patient simply presses a button on the recorder.  Previously, the device has been programmed to record a multiple number of events with a variable amount of time recorded.  Depending how the recorder was programmed, events have been recorded both prior and post event.B.  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS1.    Cardiac Event Monitoring:Cardiac Event monitoring is a continuous loop, digital memory recorder worn forextended periods of time (up to 30 days or more) that can record transient events felt by the patient at any time. Because of the transient and infrequent nature of these symptoms, this is the acceptable tool for documenting arrhythmias that are missed on a 24-hour Holter Monitor.  Event monitoring services include a 14-30 day period and require the contractor to monitor services by a team of certified cardiology technicians staffing their respective laboratory 24 hours a day, seven days a week.   Upon enrollment of a patient for Cardiac Event monitoring services, the contractor shall ship a Cardiac Event recorder directly to the patients home address.  Each recorder shall come complete with enough electrodes, batteries, and other consumable items to allow the patient to use the device for up to 30 days. A pre-paid shipping envelope shall also be included so that the patient can return the event recorder directly to contractors lab at the conclusion of the monitoring period. Contractor staff shall instruct the patient via the telephone on how to wear the monitor and record their ECG when they experience symptoms such as palpitations or dizzy spells.During the monitoring period patients call a toll-free telephone number after they have felt a symptom and recorded an ECG.  The contractors cardiac technicians will then ask the patients to describe their symptoms, what they were doing when they experienced their symptoms, and then ask them to transmit the ECG from the event recorder.  Contractor personnel shall be sufficiently familiar with the operation of their specific event recorders, and help instruct patients on how to make the transmission.  Once the transmission has been received, technicians will prepare a report to be delivered to the referring physician either via fax or via an approved internet-based Global Cardio software program.If the transmitted ECG demonstrates an abnormal rhythm that fits pre-established notification criteria, a physician shall be contacted immediately by contractor personnel.  These notification criteria may be established individually per customer or per physician preference.Contractor shall offer the government multiple report formats that can be selected by the patient, COTR, or physician, and make them available through the internet utilizing the contractors specific capabilities.  Physicians or Nurses with an internet connection shall be able to log on to a secure web application provided and maintained by the contractor and review any of their patient transmissions within minutes of the ECG being transmitted to the contractor.2.    Holter Monitoring:Holter Monitoring is sometimes called continuous EKGs (electrocardiograms) andis based on a 24 or 48 hour time period and is used for the monitoring of patients heart rhythms.   The Holter monitor is a small device which can be carried in a pocket Wires connect the device to sensors that are stuck to the patients chest using sticky patches.  These sensors detect and record the hearts electrical signals.  When the patient returns the recorder to the ordering facility, the client shall utilize an internet application, data exchange, to digitally transmit the ECG to the contractors secure computer server.  The contractors laboratory technicians (credentialed as Certified Cardiac Technicians by Cardiovascular Credentialing International) shall analyze each recording using a Century series Holter analysis system, or equal, and post a completed report back to the web site within 24 hours of receipt at the contractors facility.  When the client logs back on to the HIPAA compliant Data Exchange program, a final report shall be available for viewing and/or printing.  Turnaround shall not exceed 24 hours.3.  Contractor shall maintain the security and integrity of patient information in accordancewith all applicable Federal, State, Local, and VA regulations/guides/directives/etc.  Violation of patient confidentiality may result in contract termination.4.   Quality Control Records:  The Contractor's facilities, methodologies, and quality controlprocedures may be examined by the Contracting Officer, his/her designee, or respective COTRs at any time during the life of the contract.  All applicable activities are to be performed in accordance with VAs Quality Management Program.5.	 The Contractor shall perform the functions required in this statement of work inaccordance with the rules of medical ethics, Federal, State and local laws, rules and regulations.  The Contractor will not participate in, nor be a party to, any activities which are in conflict with Federal and/or State guidelines.  In the event the Contractor encounters said conflicting situations, the Contractor will notify the COTR or the Contracting Officer to resolve such issues. The Contracting Officer will document the file and refer the matter to the local privacy officer for resolution of any such situations. Neither the VA nor the Contractor will be responsible for delays or failures to perform due to causes beyond each party's control. The VA and contractor may, upon mutual consent, modify the timing and schedule of services.6.	 The contractor shall be responsible for establishment, maintenance and all costsassociated with toll-free telephone lines, computer related operations, and all necessary shipping fees required for performance of this service.7.	 The Contractor shall have an adequate back-up system in place to maintainsatisfactory coverage in the event of a primary system failure.  In case of scheduled downtime, Contractor will notify respective COTR at least 72 hours in advance with the date and estimated period of downtime.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Specialized Contracting Division (AAC/PKES) through the Air Armament Capabilities Integration Directorate (AAC/XR) is contemplating the sole source award of a Firm Fixed Price purchase order to Rand Machine Products, Inc., 2072 Allen Street Extension, Falconer, NY, 14733. The NAICS code for this procurement is 332721 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. The purchase order will procure forty (40) BLU-109/CB Eutectic Aft Closure Retainer Ring Assemblies, with an option for twenty (20) additional Assemblies (for total potential procurement of sixty (60)). The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br /><br />AAC/XR is currently conducting test and characterization of design modifications to improve the survivability of BLU-109 penetrator warhead fuzes as part of its Legacy Weapon Improvement Program (LWIP). To support testing of the design modifications, a May 2010 award is anticipated for the procurement of BLU-109/CB Eutectic Aft Closure Retainer Ring Assemblies. <br /><br />The procurement of the Eutectic Closure Retainer Rings for the BLU-109 warhead cases can only be met by Rand Machine Products because of their exclusive, proven expertise in the manufacturing of the Eutectic Closure Retainer Ring Assembly. Additionally Rand's tooling, fixtures, inspection, and machine programming further enhances its justification as sole source for the test hardware. The aforementioned capabilities will allow deliveries in time to meet the Government's testing schedule. Without Rand's support in this effort the Legacy Warhead Improvement Program would have to stop testing until a new vendor is qualified. The Government estimates that this can take one year and would adversely impact the testing schedule and overall Program Plan (the current effort's period of performance is only one year, slated to begin March 2010). To support this effort, Eutectic Rings will be required by 1 May 2010. The qualification process is complex and time consuming, with no assurance on success. Rand's previous manufacturing support of 685 ARSS IM/BLU-121 test asset procurements and BLU-117, BLU-109, and BLU-122 production contracts has consistently proven to be technically sound, cost effective, and timely, and they are the only vendor qualified to meet the requirements of the BLU-109 Technical Data Package. <br /><br />The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the points of contact identified below. The AAC Ombudsman is Col Arnold W Bunch, AAC/CV, (850) 882-5422. The Alternate Ombudsman is Col Lawrence G Avery, Jr., (850) 882-5422. Contact Dana Alexander, Contracting Officer, (850) 882-0185, e-mail dana.alexander@eglin.af.mil for further information about this procurement.<br />

<p>This notice is not to be construed as any type of request for proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Any responses submitted will not be received or interpreted as a proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Space computing falls into two broad categories: processing to support the spacecraft bus (satellite control) and processing supporting the mission payload. Satellite control requires modest processing but high reliability, and is not the subject of this RFI. Mission payload processing may have to deal with modest to high data requirements, processor speed, and memory access, while some applications may allow occasional errors, depending on type of data, frequency of collection, and criticality of the mission.</p>
<p>Commercial electronics have gone to billions of instructions/sec (GIPS)-level performance and multicore for both consumer and specialized applications. Space processing state-of-the-art, however, is typified by "sub-GIPS" single-core architectures, augmented by application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and other support processing circuits. In space processing architectures, on-chip memory (Level 1 cache) is limited, and availability of usable Level 2 cache memory is limited. As a compromise, space systems with limited missions and orbits have used commercial processors, compensating for faultsby approaches involving temporal and spatial redundancy (e.g., triplicating and voting the processing) to assure valid operation in the harsh space environment.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements and Enabling Capabilities Addressed by Advanced Space Processing</strong></p>
<p>Onboard processing for satellite applications is constrained by reliability in the space radiation environment (radiation hardness) and by power (including heat removal). To meet the needs of next-generation space systems, advanced processors will require substantial gains in performance and energy efficiency (e.g., &gt;10 GIPS performance and &gt;1 GIPS/W). As a minimum, radiation hardness will need to include resilience against total ionizing dose and tolerance to single event effects (with some missions including dose rate specifications). Sophisticated, high-speed input/output must be supported, and mission lifetimes in excess of 10 years.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has an on-going and historic interest in electronics subsystem technology maturation projects that are applicable to AMPS concepts. AFRL is considering a diversity of development and demonstration projects involving AMPS concepts, ranging from new technologies (e.g., three-dimensional circuitry, asynchronous/multi-value computation) and processes, to those involving the adaptation of contemporary components and architectures for effective use in the space environment. We are concerned with not just effective near-term approaches, but those that also extend to support a broad planning and development horizon (i.e., &gt; 2030). To provide a framework for responses to this RFI and to encourage responses from component and subsystem technology suppliers as well as system integrators, eight key aspects of space computing have been identified.</p>
<p><strong>Space Computing Aspects</strong></p>
<p>1. Component architecture<br />2. Core types, feature sets, and scalability/extensibility<br />3. Embedded memory configuration and distribution<br />4. Interconnect strategy within chip, between chips, and intra-system<br />5. Software strategy<br />6. Radiation hardness and reliability assurance approach and anticipated goals<br />7. Business strategy<br />8. Anticipated scope of space applications</p>
<p>The above list does not presume a Government priority of these aspects. The following expanded descriptions of the space computing aspects provide additional details but are not meant to be all-inclusive.</p>
<p>1. Component architecture: Describe the overall use of computing elements (one or more), how they access the memory, and how they communicate internally. Is the architecture suitable for narrowly-focussed applications, or is it broadly applicable to the widest spectrum of computation problems of interest? Homogeneous versus heterogeneous processing elements, shared versus global memory, static versus dynamic network, network topology, are some of the trades that should be considered and described. A key element of the architecture description should be origin, that is, open versus proprietary, commercial versus special-purpose or unique; and state of maturity (demonstrated versus under development).</p>
<p>2. Core types, feature sets, and scalability/extensibility: The computing element or elements can be described as processing cores with characteristics such as word-length, pipeline organization, floating point versus fixed point, estimated instructions or operations per second, processing concurrency, thread-intensive (general purpose) versus stream-intensive (special focused on processing chores with highly regular structure), memory bandwidth, and extensibility. A key element of the core(s) description should be origin, that is, open versus proprietary, commercial versus special-purpose or unique; and state of maturity (demonstrated versus under development).</p>
<p>3. Embedded memory type, size, and distribution: The on-chip memory strategy and notions of caching hierarchy are critical to optimizing performance of the core(s). If DRAM is proposed, its architecture (e.g., DDR, QDR) should be included.</p>
<p>4. Interconnect strategy within chip, between chips, and intra-system: Interconnect strategy should include discussion of internal as well as external interconnect fabrics. If stacked or 3-D technology is proposed, interconnect discussion will be the major focus area. What types of communications protocols are expected/supported, how scalable are these fabrics?</p>
<p>5. Software strategy: Software strategy includes maturity and availability of support for legacy code as well as existence of assemblers, compilers, debuggers, and support for partitioning and network management for multiprocessor solutions.</p>
<p>6. Radiation hardness approach and reliability assurance and anticipated goals: Radiation hardness is often traded for performance and density.We are interested in understanding this trade space in particular, which features and "knobs" might be available to tune to achieve objectives of performance vs. reliability. The Government is not setting a firm set of hardness goals for this RFI, but expects responses to discuss: baseline hardening strategy (levels and approach), level of understanding of architecture, core, or memory vulnerabilities, and penalties (e.g., size, performance) for added hardness.</p>
<p>7. Business strategy: This aspect includes a description of the anticipated technology node (described by the technology and minimum feature size, e.g., 90nm bulk CMOS, 32nm fully depleted SOI), estimate of physical die size, potential costs, cost-sharing arrangements, risks, technology development requirements and the associated timelines for developing the concept. Information about block developments, spiral developments or initial system development with limited capabilities is also requested in this aspect. Potential teaming strategies should also be described, particularly for companies with limited space electronics business experience.</p>
<p>8. Anticipated scope of space applications: It is requested that responses include information regarding the applicability of the processing approach to potential space mission applications. Information about both narrowly focused and broadly applicable processing approaches is encouraged.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information to assess the feasibility of funding research to identify potential AMPS concepts, including the range of algorithm types that they would be best suited for and to gauge industry interest and capability.<br /><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. <br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not obligate the government in any manner for any future acquisitions. Responders are advised the government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. This is not a notice of intent to contract. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information solicited.</p>

The contract is for a period of 90 days pending the award of the successor solicitation SPM7LX08R0179.  The current contract will expire on December 16, 2009 and this contract will incorporate all technical products and service requirements and contract terms and conditions contained within Contract SPM75005D7426 by a contract modification action. The sole source award by contract modification is being issued through other than full and open competition procedures (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B)) and will expire on March 16, 2010.

There is currently a large Army reset program in the works and any delay in the procurement process will impact readiness of the Up Armored HMMWV fleet.  These vehicles are those that are needed in support of SWA.  The current contract with BAE is helping us maintain a readiness rate of 92%.  With the contract currently in place with BAE, they can support these urgent requirements and can supply these items with a delivery of 5-10 days (depending on Priority code) directly to the customer. It is in the Government’s best interest to make this sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems.

If you should have any questions or concerns about this notice, or if you have an interest in this procurement, please contact Margaret Mickey at 614-692-8868 or email at margaret.mickey@dla.mil.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The government intends to solicit a proposal and enter into a contract with SHEINBERG ASSOCIATES, 204 N FRANKLIN ST, JUNEAU, AK 99801-1225, a small business concern, to provide Facilitation Services to Glacier Bay National Park. Steinberg Associates has previous experience working on this type of specific scientific meeting. Please see the below Justification for other than Full and Open Competition for further details.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please-mail contract specialist, Jordan Gunn with responses or questions regarding this requirement at jordan_gunn@nps.gov.


JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPENCOMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)

BACKGROUND:Since even before its establishment in 1925, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve (GLBA) has maintained a long and storied tradition of hosting scientific research.  Its enabling Proclamation and subsequent legislation and management policies and guidance have all explicitly recognized the park's inherent values to science, principally owing to the character of its young, dynamic, and actively developing ecosystems, its record of landscape history, and the relatively pristine condition of resources mostly buffered from anthropogenic impacts.  The park encompasses a suite of world-class natural and cultural resources even as it perpetually faces a variety of challenging management issues associated with protecting those resources while providing for public enjoyment.GLBA's "research opportunity value", then - both to substantially contribute to science in general as well as to provide information to assist management in addressing pressing management problems - is exceeding high.  Ironically, the park has never formally developed a comprehensive research plan which identifies and prioritizes its full range of scientific needs and opportunities.  This is a task necessary to effectively and efficiently allocate limited resources (funds, energy, time) to resolve important issues by informing science-based decision-making.  Such a task will also optimally organize the park's approach to encouraging and supporting research efforts that can best contribute to scientific knowledge in general.
Consequently, the GLBA Resource Management staff has embarked upon a process to identify and prioritize scientific information needs that will guide park management and external researchers in intelligently investing research effort over the coming decades.  As a central and initial step, the Resource Management staff will actively develop its knowledge to create the core of a Research Plan.  To facilitate full and open communication among park staff, and to capture the results, a facilitated two-day workshop is being planned.
The meeting will have two measurable outcomes.  First, the meeting format will ensure robust and focused communication among park resource managers.  These managers are uniquely qualified to identify not only the important management issues, but also the research approaches that will address the information gaps to ensure knowledge-based decisions-making.  Similarly, they are intimately familiar with the potential for park resources to frame research that will contribute to scientific knowledge in general.  Secondly, the meeting results and recommendations must be captured in a formal report - tailored to park managers - documenting research needs and priorities.  This report will ultimately guide the park's future research agenda, and it will serve as the primary and essential product of the workshop. 
This workshop needs to be directed by a skilled professional facilitator who is intimately familiar with earlier, less-comprehensive and more focused internal park efforts to organize its scientific knowledge (particularly re. identifying information gaps).  In addition, the facilitator must have a deep understanding of GLBA park management goals, as well as familiarity with park resources and management issues.  1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:   Since 2004, Sheinberg Associates, 204 N. Franklin Street, Suite 1, Juneau, Alaska 99801 have facilitated several meetings of the NPS Southeast Alaska Inventory and Monitoring Network of parks, of which GLBA is a dominant member.  Subsequent to those meetings Sheinberg Associates produced major programmatic documents detailing both the natural resources and the scientific research legacy and prospects of GLBA.  These products include Freshwater Monitoring Scoping Workshop Summary Report (2005), Marine Ecosystems Monitoring Scoping Workshop Summary Report (2006), Terrestrial Ecosystems Monitoring Scoping Workshop Summary Report (2006), and Vital Signs Selection Historical Documentation: Southeast Alaska Network (2007).  Similarly, Sheinberg Associates have facilitated every meeting of the Glacier Bay Science Advisory Board (a group charged with identifying and prioritizing research needs related to evaluating potential resource impacts by cruise ships) since its inception in 2004, and have helped write The Glacier Bay National Park Science Advisory Board: Final Report for Research and Monitoring Needs Relevant to Decisions Regarding Increasing Seasonal Use Days for Cruise Ships in Glacier Bay (2005); the follow-up Glacier Bay Science Advisory Board Recommendations Regarding Prioritization of Research and Monitoring Needs Relevant to Decisions Regarding Increasing Seasonal Use Days for Cruise Ships in Glacier Bay (2006); and most recently the Proceedings of the SAB-hosted 2009 Cruise Ship Science Meeting to present research results to date (final in preparation, 2010).  This contractor has intimate familiarity with the natural resources, scientific research processes, and associated technical terminology that will be used throughout the workshop.  They also are familiar with the park's scientific history as well as its management issues, and they have worked closely with many of the workshop participants.  If Sheinberg Associates were not used for facilitation there would be substantial duplication of the cost to the Government (as stated in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A)) in that a new vendor would have to closely review all of the documents and efforts of park staff and the Science Advisory Board in order to fully understand the purpose and the expected product (and critical supporting background information) that Sheinberg Associates already is very familiar with.  The quality of this workshop and its products will be a direct reflection of the effectiveness of the facilitator during and immediately following the meeting.    	2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: Facilitate Research Agenda Workshop and resulting summary report.
3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e., unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): The Research Agenda Workshop, slated for April 2010, will reflect the cumulative actions and knowledge of key resource staff, particularly those of the past decade.  Sheinberg Associates have facilitated several of the seminal meetings (including every Science Advisory Board meeting since its inception in 2005) and helped write many of the formal summary reports upon which this workshop's process and outcomes will be based.  Because of their experience and close association with like GLBA processes in the recent past, Sheinberg Associates have the skills and expertise to very efficiently assist park staff with historical and contextual issues that will likely arise during the workshop.  
4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted: In many ways the upcoming workshop will represent and be based upon an accumulation of those meetings and resulting reports that have occurred since 2004, virtually all of which have been facilitated by Sheinberg Associates.  We are not aware of another vendor who can bring to bear a similar amount and combination of knowledge and expertise.  Given their previous six years of experience with GLBA and that this meeting represents an accumulation of those efforts, Sheinberg Associates is the only facilitator with the knowledge to efficiently support park staff  in achieving the outcomes desired from the workshop.  
5)Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  N/A
6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers for competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:   There has been only one vendor, Sheinberg Associates, who has participated in activities related to natural resource ecological synthesis and scientific research analysis, including meeting facilitation and report production.  No other facilitator has this ability to combine knowledge of park resources and processes, the history of research, park management issues, and park management goals - all in context - to effectively and efficiently facilitate a workshop like this and produce a report that builds on the previous efforts.

<DESC>The National Park Service, Lassen Volcanic National Park, has a requirement for 1,200 tons of fine grained volcanic rock (medium to fine grade basalt ), angular building stone to be used in the rehabilitation of the retaining walls on the Lassen Peak Trail. Vascular basalt is unacceptable as it un-expectantly breaks in random undesirable directions when shaping. Stone should be predominantly gray in color (with 50% of reddish tones also being acceptable and preferred) and weigh between 150 - 300 lbs each. A maximum of 50% of the material shall weigh between 200- 300lbs with the other 50% weighing between 150- 199lbs. Color tones should be divided between specified weights listed (1/2 of total between 200- 300lbs being gray in color and 1/2 having reddish tones- and the same for the smaller stones, material 150- 199lbs- 1/2 shall be gray in color and 1/2 having reddish tones), must be angular buildable stone. As part of the park's Best Management Practices for preventing the spread of exotic plants within the park, the Resource Management staff needs to visually inspect each quarry before delivery to assure stone is acceptable building material and that the rock has been recently quarried and washed to assure no invasive plant species are introduced into the park,  located within Lassen Volcanic National Park as specified in RFQ No. Q8400100020.  The NAICS code is 212311.
This project is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the contractor must meet all reporting requirements as prescribed in FAR 52.204-11. The Contractor shall report the required information using the online reporting tool available at www.FederalReporting.gov.

<DESC>NAVFAC Washington Contractor Partner
You are invited to attend the NAVFAC Washington Safety Symposium on March 31, 2010 at the Catering and Conference Center, Building 221, located at the Washington Navy Yard.
While the overall mishap rates for NAVFAC Washington employees and our contractor partners have been much lower than industry averages, in recent months we have experienced one tragic fatality and several significant near misses in our construction and base operating support contracts. 
To quote the Commander of NAVFAC, Rear Admiral Greg Shear, "There is no activity that NAVFAC performs or administers where benefits outweigh risks of loss of life." With more than 100 contractors working at our 18 supported installations, I have witnessed a wide variety of safety programs (some excellent and some lacking) and I have seen where engagement from corporate leadership made substantial positive impact in the safety performance of companies doing work for the Navy.
During the Symposium, I will share my thoughts on creating and maintaining a safe working environment and emphasize the command's Safety SPOT check program.   Annapolis has the most mature Safety SPOT check program and our senior leadership from the Naval Academy and a few of your colleagues will speak about their experiences. There will be a facilitated discussion period and an awards ceremony at the end of the event.
Please contact Larry Carpenter at (202) 685-8188 or email him at: Larry.W.Carpenter@navy.mil by 29 March with your RSVP.  Firms are limited to four representatives per company as space is limited.  The target audience for the Symposium is company principles accompanied by your safety professionals.
I appreciate your personal attention to improving safety conditions and performance and look forward to seeing you at the WNY Catering & Conference Center on March 31st.

Sincerely,R. HemstreetCaptain, CEC, U.S. NavyCommanding Officer

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority for FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this notice of intent.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Pacific Consulting Group (PCG) is considered the vendor who can administer, analyze, and report on a customer engagement survey and identify priority improvement areas.  It has become apparent from both an economic and scheduling standpoint that proceeding with processing this as a competitive solicitation is not a viable option.  Specifically, PCG held the prior two orders covering this survey.  Initially, the Navy devoted an extensive amount of time explaining how the Navy civilian personnel systems operate so that PSG could provide the required services.  At this point in time, there are insufficient Government resources to provide similar assistance to a new contractor.  Therefore, it is not economically feasible to contract for these services from any firm other than PSG due to the extensive learning survey that any other firm will need in order to perform these services. The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541910.  All responses may be emailed to Jillian Swanson at jillian.swanson@navy.mil and reference number N6919710RS1300.  For additional information concerning this requirement, please contact Jillian Swanson at 215-697-9813.

Sybase, Inc. is the only source that has been identified as capable of satisfying the SEC’s requirement.  The majority of the SEC's most critical enterprise applications, such as EDGAR, NRSI and HUB are built on the Sybase ASE DBMS.  Therefore, Sybase maintenance is needed.  Due to licensing, warranty, and compatibility issues, it is not possible for another source to meet the SEC’s requirement.  

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1 – Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The SEC intends to award a contract to Sybase, Inc. on or about March 8, 2010. This notice is not a competitive request for proposals.  A competitive solicitation will not be issued.  However, the government will give consideration to interested parties that identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals by the response date of this notice.

A total of 8 samples will be collected from 8 stations within the shoaled areas in the Red Run Drain.  Sampling will be coordinated to avoid spring run off time and high rain events to minimize the water depth in the drain.  The depth of the water in the drain at the sampling areas are reported to be less than 2 feet; therefore a boat is not anticipated for the sampling.  A drain easement is present along the entire drain length allowing easy access via a vehicle to the sampling locations

<DESC>Center for Health Care Contracting, 2107 17th Street, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, 78234, intends to award a sole source contract to Applied Biosystems, LLC. for Reagents.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003 (41 U.S.C. 428a) and the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, 13.501(a), only one source reasonably available.  The requested reagents are as follows:  (1) N8080260 dNTP MIX w/dTTP, 1ml, 10mM, 100 ea;  (2) 450006 Custom PRISM Primer 80,000 Picomoles, 1 ea; (3) 4352757 3130 POP-6 TM Polymer (7ml), 60 ea;  (4) 4335611 POP7, box of 30 bottles, 1 box; (5) 4307176 dGTP BDT RR 100 RXN, 30 kits; (6) 4352755 POP 4 (7ml) 3130, 84 ea; (7)  4337452 Big Dye TF V1.1 RR 5000 & Seq Buffer, 3 kits; (8) 4304971 Sequence Detection Primer, 80,000 PICOMO, 6 ea.<BR><BR>Only Applied Biosystems (AB) is capable of providing the required supplies and reagents in support of 65 highly specialized scientific instruments.  Comparable products with even the very slightest differences would compromise the compatibility and consistency of DNA identification.  The use of non AB reagents that deposit or cause to deposit residual matter in any AB instrument flow path may lead to instrument failure.  This may require remedial repairs outside the maintenance agreement that may double or triplicate the price, and suspend DNA processing.  <BR><BR>The Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL) is an American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) accredited forensic lab, which means the FBIs Quality Assurance Document is followed.  Based on accreditation adherence (section IV of the Master Operating Plan and the FBIs QAS document), all reagents and equipment must be developmentally validated by the company and internally validated by the laboratory as well as pass a stringent quality control before being released for casework.   Further, AFIPs mission requires consistency and standardization of testing to accomplish its overall mission and to maintain credibility, therefore, accuracy is critical to AFIP's mission.  The AFDIL is equipped with 65 instruments that are optimized to specifically operate with Applied Biosystems reagents.   Vital to the DNA identification mission is the need for reproducible and accurate test results with no lot to lot variability as determined through extensive internal validation studies.   The sequencing, typing, amplification, quantitation, and other stages of DNA identification process are performed using reagents compatible with the specific analysis laboratory equipment/instruments.  <BR><BR>Only Applied Biosystems (AB) is capable of providing the required supplies and reagents in support of 65 highly specialized scientific instruments.  Comparable products with even the very slightest differences would compromise the compatibility and consistency of DNA identification.  <BR><BR>This requirement is for the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL), Rockville, MD  20850.  In accordance with FAR Part 13.501(a), Center for Health Care Contracting intends to award a sole source contract to Applied Biosystems, LLC for Reagents, under NAICS code 334516.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). Submit written proposals on RFQ Number AG-82B1-S-10-0270.

(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33.

(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 115310, Support Activities for Forestry. The small business size standard is $7 Million.

Total 		Approx 418 Acres

(VI) Detailed description of requirements is included in attached statement of work and exhibits.  The following is a general description of the services to be performed:

The intent of this contract is to secure services for mechanical treatment of 418 acres of vegetation to remove ladder fuels and reduce the continuity of fuels adjacent to an urban interface community.  Vegetation consists of young to mature mountain mahogany, sagebrush, bitterbrush, manzanita, and ceanothus.  Most units are plantations planted in the 1960’s and are terraced.  Some units have areas of naturally regenerated conifer saplings that range from 4-20 ft in height. Vegetation to be treated will require cutting, chipping, shredding and mulching.  The treatment will reduce ladder fuels and rearrange natural vegetation to a state that will burn with reduced fire intensity during a wildfire event.  Firefighter safety will be improved as well as a reduced threat to the public and private property.   The work shall be done in a manner that does not damage vegetation not specified to be treated.

(VII) Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance: 

The project area is located in the west portion of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest on the Carson Ranger District.  The project area lies about twenty miles west of the city of Reno Nv.  in the Dog Valley area just inside the California state line and is accessed through either the town of Verdi Ca. via U.S. 80 or Bordertown Nv. via U.S 395.  The legal description for the project area is T19N, R17E, Section 1, and T20N, R17E sections 24, 25, and 26 Mount Diablo Base Meridian.  

Estimated start date is September 1, 2010, with an estimated contract time of 213 Days (April 1, 2011).  Activities may occur during winter months as long as soils are frozen and snow depth does not affect treatment of vegetation, and dead and down material.

AWARD DETERMINATION 
Award will be made to the offeror whose offer provides the best value to the government, considering price and the non-price factors listed below. Non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.  

The selection official will base the award decision on a tradeoff between price and non-price factors, comparing the relative risk to the government of poor or non-performance posed by each of the offerors, and making a judgment as to whether or not reduced risk of performance is worth the additional cost.  In some cases this will result in award to a lower-ranked but lower-priced offer; in other cases the result will be award to a higher-ranked but higher-priced offer. 

EVALUATION FACTORS

Acceptability of the Offer
The Government will determine the acceptability of each offer on a pass or fail basis. An offer is acceptable when it manifests the offeror's assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the RFP, including attachments. If an offeror takes an exception to any of the terms and conditions of the RFP, then the Government will consider its offer to be unacceptable.

Capability of the Offeror
This procurement is being conducted under the terms of “National Fire Plan,” with the goal of enhancing economic development in rural communities.

The Government will assess the capability of each offeror on the basis of the following criteria which are of approximately equal value:   (1) Organizational Experience, (2) Organizational Past Performance, (3) Local Community Economic Enhancement, and (4) Understanding of the Government's requirements. The Government will not assess capability on a pass/fail basis, but will use its assessments of capability as a basis for comparing offerors to determine best value.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2010-111-DDC and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38 (12/10/2009).

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711 and the business size standard is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is set aside for small business. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to negotiate and award an order to Rules Based Medicine Inc., 3300 Duval Rd., Austin TX 78759, for Research in the Urinary Biomarkers in the Framingham Heart Study as outlined in the Statement of Work.

Brief History/Purpose/Description of Project:

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; NHLBI) -- embarked on an ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic.

The objective of the Framingham Heart Study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The Framingham Heart Study continues to make important scientific contributions by enhancing its research capabilities and capitalizing on its inherent resources. 

While pursuing the studies established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators are expanding their research into other areas such as the role of metabolic risk factors in the pathogenesis of CVD. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important risk factor for CVD and an important public health problem. The most severe stage of CKD, dialysis or transplantation, affects over 500,000 patients in the United States. Earlier stages of CKD are common, affecting 13% of adults in the United States, and 16 million individuals have reduced kidney function (CKD stages 3-5).  In addition to increasing the risk for end-stage renal disease and a range of complications including anemia and bone disease, CKD increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. 

Hypertension and diabetes are key risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD), but do not fully identify individuals at risk for developing CKD.  A recently developed algorithm for incident CKD demonstrates poor discrimination, highlighting the need to identify novel biomarkers for the development of CKD.  Serum creatinine, as used in the MDRD equation, is the primary biomarker for CKD.  However, creatinine is insensitive to early perturbations in renal function, particularly among individuals without overt clinical CKD.  Further, serum creatinine provides no identification as to the nature of renal injury.  This highlights the need for novel biomarkers that can more accurately identify individuals at risk for developing CKD, as well as provide prognostic information based on location of renal injury.

Urinary biomarkers offer novel insight into renal health and may help identify individuals at risk for CKD before the development of overt clinical disease.  Urinary assessment of biomarkers for CKD can provide information regarding the location of renal injury, which may have prognostic consequences for patients with CKD.  Further, urinary biomarkers can provide insight into the biology of disease, and may help to better classify individuals at risk for developing CKD in the absence of overt clinical disease.  The Human Kidney Damage Biomarker Panel (Rules Based Medicine) is a urinary biomarker panel recently developed to detect early renal disease.  The panel contains the following urinary biomarkers:  alpha-1microglobulin, beta-2 microglobulin, calbindin, clustering, connective tissue growth factor, cystatin C, glutathione s-transferase alpha, kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipcalin, osteopontin, tamm-horsfall protein, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, trefoil factor 3, and vascular endothelial growth factor.  This SOW outlines pilot work to measure a panel of 14 urinary biomarkers in 2900 individuals from the Framingham Heart Study.  All of these individuals have 10-year follow-up data available for the development of chronic kidney disease, CVD, and death.

This project involves the contractor performing the urinary biomarker assays in 2900 individuals, and promptly returning the data within 30 days to NHLBI.  

I. Contractor Requirements   
A.	Contractor will provide biomarker assay services to measure 14 analysts listed above in 2900 urine samples.  The contractor will process NHLBI samples at contractor location using the bead luminex technology.    
B.	The Contractor will provide high quality assay results with: 
a.	CVs generally less than 10%
C.	Quality control measures will be applied by the Contractor and assay results will be accompanied by quality control information reflecting inter-assay CVs.
D.	Contractor will specify any special packaging, marking, or shipping instructions for sample shipment.
E.	Each urine sample received will be identified by the Contractor using the identifiers provided by NHLBI.

II. Government Responsibilities   
A.	NHLBI will provide to the Contractor 200 microliters of urine.  In addition, NHLBI will provide a list of identifiers for urine samples.  


III. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables    
A.	Assay results will be returned by Contractor to NHLBI in a standard format in a nonproprietary database in which each analyte is identified by a standard name. 
B.	Return of assay results by the Contractor will be accompanied by summary quality control measures for each analyte.
C.	Assay results will be returned to NHLBI within 10 business days of receipt of urine samples. 


Program Management and Control Requirements 
No special management or control systems are required under this contract.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that this project is to measure urinary biomarkers in 2900 individuals from the Framingham Heart Study. Chronic kidney disease is a major public health problem and biomarkers to identify early renal injury are limited. This project will capitalize on prior work Dr. Caroline Fox to identify new markers of kidney function to better identify individuals at risk for disease.  Rules Based Medicine Inc., (RBM) is the sole provider of the Human Kidney MAP panel which measures 14 urinary biomarkers.  RMB has optimized this panel to used a small amount of urine volume, and have achieved excellent reproducibility of the result.

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR NOAA <br />Open VMS Operating System and Layered Product IT Technical Support Services<br />DG133E-10-RP-1130
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) located in Silver Spring, MD is planning to procure Web/Internet IT support services to provide unlimited Technical support (24x7x365) for various versions of the Open VMS Operating System and Digital Equipment Corp (DEC)/Compaq/Hewlett-Packard(HP) branded Layered Products which run on (DEC)/Compaq/(HP) branded VAX, Alpha, and Itanium IT systems at a reasonable cost and adhering to high industry technical support standards for the Office of Satellite Operations. Provide a proposal consisting of your technical approach and price (fully loaded labor hour rates (hourly), and labor category, requesting contractors best estimate of required labor to do this level of effort) for satisfying the attached Statement of Objectives (SOO). Proposals will be evaluated based on the technical approach to satisfying the SOO, a review &amp; rating of resumes of planned persons (based on specific experience as required by the SOO), as well as reported past performance. Past performance is to be reported as part of proposal based on similar effort conducted in a federal or DoD environment during the last three years. The contracting officer will make a best value award decision weighing the technical merits of the proposed technical approach and personnel qualifications (resumes/experience) together with past performance as well as the overall mix of labor and price. Technical approach, resumes/experience, and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price, and the contracting officer may make award to other than the lowest priced offeror to establish a best value for the Government. <br />Computer systems which are used to execute custom Telemetry and Command application programs are based upon the OpenVMS operating system, a product of the Hewlett-Packard Company (HP). All offerors must be Hewlett Packard Authorized providers. While the OSO Software Support Branch does maintain a high level of expertise on these systems, there are instances where more detailed knowledge is necessary to resolve unusual operating system, and/or VMS Layered Product behaviors and/or problems.</p>
<p>The desired support structure will resolve VMS Operating System and Layered Product Application problems in a timely and effective manner which ensures maximum system availability. A US on-shore support source will provide a realistic time-coordinated means of communication between OSO and the support facility.</p>
<p>This is a 100% Small Business set-aside, the NAICS code for this action is 541519, with a size standard of $25 million. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This action is issued as a request for proposal. The solicitation number is DG133E-10-RP-1130. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-31. This process is being conducted under the test procedures for the procurement of commercial items under the authority of FAR 13.5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Requirements for OpenVMS Technical Support Services</p>
<p>The initial scope is to obtain an agreement to provide OpenVMS Operating System and VMS Layered Product Technical Support to a 24x7x365 operation through the use of direct telephone technical support (Help Desk) and/or through the use of vendor Technical Publication, Database, Knowledgebase, or Web-based customer access which encompasses the areas specified in the Performance Objectives, on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p>Period and Place of Performance; <br />Period of Performance shall be one (1) year with one additional one year option. The planned award date is late January 2010.<br />IT Systems are physically located at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland, Maryland. However, the technical support services will be via telephone, vendor Internet web services, and/or email.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Office of Satellite Operations is responsible for the health and safety of the Nation's Weather Satellites, and is also responsible to ensure satellite instrument data is available to the users of that data. <br />Computer systems which are used to execute custom Telemetry and Command application programs are based upon the OpenVMS operating system, a product of the Hewlett-Packard Company (HP). While the OSO Software Support Branch does maintain a high level of expertise on these systems, there are instances where more detailed knowledge is necessary to resolve unusual operating system, and/or VMS Layered Product behaviors and/or problems. <br />Historically, HP Software Technical Unlimited Support has been packaged as an integral part of the HP Software Update Service (SUS) Agreement. SUS is an annually recurring maintenance item necessary to comply with the Hewlett-Packard right to use the OpenVMS Operating System and Layered Products terms and conditions, and to maintain the right to version updates and product patches offered by HP. HP has de-coupled SUS and Technical Support and allows a customer to obtain those items separately. A list of components to be supported is as follows.</p>
<p>The desired support structure will resolve VMS Operating System and Layered Product Application problems in a timely and effective manner which ensures maximum system availability. A US on-shore support source will provide a realistic time-coordinated means of communication between OSO and the support facility.</p>
<p>Performance Objectives:</p>
<p>1. Provide an equivalent (or better) direct replacement of` HP Software Technical Unlimited Support, on a 24x7x365 schedule, which includes (at a minimum), assistance in the following areas: <br />System Startup/Shutdown Sequences <br />Network Device Configuration <br />Backup and Restore processes <br />General Troubleshooting of the OS and Layered Products <br />Crash Dump Analysis <br />Performance Recommendations <br />Language Compiler usage and error diagnostics <br />Crash Dump Analysis <br />System/File/User Security Management Parameters <br />2. Call Management - Clear, concise, and direct communications are key factors: <br />Eliminate Phone Menu systems to the greatest extent possible <br />Typical Response within 2 hours of initial call <br />Initiate Problem Tracking upon first call contact <br />Provide Progress Updates as the problem is being worked <br />Make Problem Report Summary available upon request <br />Allow for Multiple Points of Contact to access vendor resources</p>
<p>3. Technical Experience in OpenVMS OS and Layered Products: <br />Technical Account Manager; average 20-25 years <br />Senior Level Technicians; 15-20 years each</p>

 (xiii)  Sole Source justification: 

Dell Power Edge Servers:  The Indian Health Service uses Dell Power Edge servers in order to provide consistent agency operation, mission and patient care for IHS.  Standardization is imperative in order to maintain adequate technical support, maintenance and staffing.  Dell supplies replacement parts and technical support ensures compatibility of hardware and minimal down time for agency critical servers.   

Dell is an approved organization Enterprise Architecture solution.  The brand allows for continuity and compatability with existing equipment.  The purchase of other brands would result in additional compatability and security tests, increased learning curves, duplicate work efforts and increased administative costs.  IT support staff are experienced with Dell server set-up, images, (HHS security configuration tested), installation, application patching (as required by HHS and IHS IT security policy), and trouble-shooting.  

The Dell server hardware configurations are currently standardized throughout IHS.  Dell servers are provisioned with a server management utility disc to assist on RAID & OS installation and configuration. 
The Dell Power Edge meets the server hardware requirements as required by VMWare.  The server is configured with VMWare preinstalled on the motherboard.  Currently no other brand does this.

SASBoy Fibre Host Interface:  The SASBoy SAN is required to utilize the power of the VMWare vSphere ability to manage many machines at once.  The SAN allows for high performance disk storage with high redundancy and availability for the SecureFusion infrastructure.  The SASBoy SAN has the ability to be expanded to meet future demand by the SecureFusion infrastructure, as well as having minimal space and energy demand.  SASBoy meets the needs of the VMWare software.  IHS is not aware or any other SAN product that will meets the VMWare requirements and work in the SecureFusion environment.

VMWare:  VMWare VCenter and vSphere are the only virtualizatin software suites that meet the needs of IHS at this time.  VMWare provides certain unique software attributes. The vShpere software allows for consolidation and continuously optimized server, storage and network hardware. It does this by allowing the moving of software across several physical servers as needed. The software has the ability to shutdown and startup servers as load demands.  The Administrator only needs to set service levels for each service and the software load balances the resources to meet those needs.

Estimated cost for all items is $175,000.00

(4) Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition: IAW FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items:
This Acquisition is done under the Authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. Section 4202, Application of Simplified Procedures to Certain
Commercial Items. Authorizes the establishment in the FAR of
Simplified procedures for acquisitions within a certain dollar range (not
to exceed $5,000,000) when the contracting officer reasonably expects
that offers will include only commercial items.
Also this following Authority is applicable to this acquisition: 
FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) Authority.  
(2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. 


(5) Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:
PAWSS operates on proprietary Lockheed-Martin MTM-200 software. Both Lockheed-Martin and C2CEN maintain baseline PAWSS systems for SMEF support, testing, and future development.  Radar video processor hardware manufactured by Osiris Corp. has been tested by Lockheed-Martin and integrated into their baseline system, as well as C2CEN’s baseline and several fielded PAWSS systems.  In order to maintain configuration management and supportability, Osiris hardware must be installed in all remaining PAWSS IAUs. 

(6) Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.

Previous order of Osiris SPCI-C616 radar video processor cards was completed by C2CEN using PR# 21-09-449TED747.  Price was determined to be reasonable at that time and hasn’t changed significantly since then. The Purchase Price paid by the Government is the same that the General Public would pay for the same items. 

(8) Description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  
After extensive market research, the determination to use Osiris SPCI-C616 radar video processor cards was made by Lockheed-Martin engineers based on PAWSS requirements, Osiris specifications, and the ability of the hardware to fit (physically) into a Dell Optiplex 760 chassis. 
 
(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: 
 
(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.  N/A
(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived:  Based on current labor rates and estimated man-hours to re-engineer PAWSS RDP/IAUs using a radar video processor other that the Osiris product, C2CEN’s COTR for the Lockheed-Martin PAWSS engineering/development contract estimates the following:
Labor:
•	784MH for personal computer radar processor (PCRP)

•	1230 MH total @ $170/MH = $209,100
Material: 
•	SSR Engineering PCRP,  49 units @ $10,600/unit = $519,400
•	Installation of PCRP, $200,000

Total:  $928,500
  


(10) List of the Sources , if any, that have expressed an interest in the acquisition: None at this time. 
. 

(11) Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: 
By Conduction ongoing Market Research.

(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief: 
Each justification shall include evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel (e.g., verifying the Government's minimum needs or schedule requirements or other rationale for other than full and open competition) and which form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by the technical or requirements personnel.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the procurement of commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for overhaul of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-300032 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). When soliciting quotes or offers, round-off prices to the nearest U.S. dollar value. The procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. Evaluation factors for award will be based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable quote. <br />The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 and the size standard is 1000 employees.
<p>AIR HEAT EXCHANGER, NSN: 1660-01-150-9084, P/N: 191390-2-2, the quantity of 4 each (Mfg cage code 70210) to be overhauled in accordance with IAW AFTO. 15A4-113-3.</p>

<p>The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. This material has been designated as ACMS Tracked. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. As a minimum, the offeror (that is, the prime contractor) must possess a current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification or an Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with its proposal/quote. Evidence of other certifications, such as a Department of Defense (DOD) Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair or overhaul of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping repairable which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair". Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage. Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition. Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for Unusually Damaged Items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work". The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices. Non-reworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose. Should any of the repairable be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions. The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document. Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule. Delivery is required no later than 45 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the repairable. Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. The USCG, ALC engineering department will make a determination on the acceptability of the DOD certification.</p>
<p>Inspection is by Certificate of Conformance and acceptance shall be performed at destination by USCG, ALC Quality Assurance. Items shipped shall be shipped to: USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Attn: Receiving Section, Bldg. 63, Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001. Fob point shall be destination.

Each individual container shall be labeled on the outside with NSN, Part Number, Serial Number, Quantity, Nomenclature, Purchase Order Number, and Line Item. Only Bar Coding of the NSN is necessary. The internal packaging material shall be sufficient to prevent damage during shipment, handling, and storage. Each unit shall be packaged to protect against electrostatic damage. Preservation protection must be sufficient to prevent corrosion, deterioration or decay during warehouse storage for a period of one year, but no preservation coating will be applied directly to the component. Packaging material shall NOT consist of the following material: popcorn, shredded paper, styrofoam of any type, or peanut style packaging. The contractor shall review all manufacturers' service bulletins, service information letters and equipment revisions for applicability against the reworked item's part number. The award will be made based on record of past performance, technical acceptability and price, access to manuals, and evidence of current certificates.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 (g) and with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Technical and Price Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The Solicitation number is: OPM10-10-R-0002 and is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38 dated January 11, 2010.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 525120, and the small business size standard is $7.0 million. This procurement is unrestricted, allowing both large and small business to submit quotations.
Worksite health and wellness programs have proven effective at improving the health of employees, lowering overall health care costs, reducing absenteeism, and improving employee morale and productivity.  Comprehensive health and wellness programs have resulted in returns on investment averaging $3 benefit for every $1 in cost. 
Worksite health and wellness programs across the federal government vary in scope; however, few, if any, could be considered at a comprehensive level that would constitute best practice.  The Office of Personnel Management has been directed by the President to develop worksite wellness models for the federal workforce that is on par with best practice in the private sector.

This document describes the development of a Prototype A site at a federal ‘campus’ in Washington, D.C. involving employees from the Office of Personnel Management, General Services Administration, and Interior Department working in the buildings located between 18th and 20th streets Northwest.  

OPM intends to award one Firm-Fixed Price contract to the offeror that represents the best value to the government.  It is anticipated award will be made on or about May 14, 2010.  The contract will be for a period of three years (one base year plus two (2) one-year option periods).  The base period is anticipated to be May 17, 2010 – May 16, 2011.  Funding for the base year is subject to the availability of Fiscal Year 2010 funds.



Offerors shall be required to provide a written proposal.  Written quotations shall be comprised of two volumes, with an original and ten (10) copies each, which shall be submitted to the Contract Specialist by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), March 25, 2010.  Volume I shall provide technical evaluation factors 1-4, to be limited to a maximum of 100 pages, Times New Roman-11 pt. font minimum, and one inch margins on all sides.  Volume II shall provide the price/cost evaluation for the level of effort proposed in completing the work as indicated in the Statement of Objectives.  In addition, offerors shall submit one copy electronically to wellness@opm.gov by the final due date for submission of quotations.  

	Please send quotations to:
	
	U.S. Office of Personnel Management

	Contracting Group, FSC
	1900 E Street, NW, Room 1342
	Washington, DC 20415-0001

Responses to all questions shall be posted on FedBizOpps no later than March 11, 2010.  Note that communications with other officials may compromise the competitiveness of this acquisition and result in the cancellation of the requirement.

Vendors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and not registered in the VETS-100 database at the time the requirement is anticipated to be awarded will not be considered.  Vendors may register with CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or (269) 961-5757, or by accessing www.ccr.gov.  Vendors may register with VETS-100 by accessing https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/.

Therefore, any vendor receiving an award exceeding $100,000 shall complete the VETS-100 registration.

Government Response to contractors question

1. After reading and rereading the SOW it remains unclear to me the DOJ preferred method d of pricing. Is the DOJ looking for and hourly rate per task or a flat rate per task or some other method?

Response: We are looking for a fixed per drop cost, inclusive of labor for the majority of our projects.  We also have to have a mechanism to have hourly labor rate to address certain situations wherein additional labor may be necessary due to a construction or an emergency situation which is beyond the Government’s control.


2. No where in the SOW or in the accompanying Excel spread sheet are the number of network drops per office defined. Is that information available?

Response: At minimum, each office will have two (2) data drops.  Specific requirements are identified by local USAO personnel and submitted to EOUSA after the project is approved.  


3. This is a very large requirement for a small business will DOJ consider dividing the requirement into geographical regions?


Response: The Program Management team must be based in Washington, DC.  EOUSA is interested in options available to address the nationwide cable project requirement.


4. Will the DOJ consider holding a pre-bid conference?

Response: EOUSA intends on conducting on-site, oral presentations for contractor proposals.


5. What division of BAE currently services the contract?

Response: BAE Systems Information Solutions, Inc.


6. Is a copy of the current contract available for review?

Response:  Yes

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical questions submitted, incorporate technical changes, and extend the due date for quotations.</p>
<p>1. The following questions and responses are hereby provided.</p>
<p>Question 1) When the temperature is 20C in the adjoining room and raises 2.5C in an hour, then what is the expected temperature in the room in an hour, 22.75?</p>
<p>Answer: If the temperature of the laboratory in which the chamber is situated goes from 20&deg;C to 22.5&deg;C in one hour, the chamber temperature is expected to rise no more than 0.25&deg;C from whatever temperature it was at the beginning of the hour. The purpose of the system is to reduce the effect of fluctuations in laboratory temperature, not to eliminate the effects of a permanent change in laboratory temperature.</p>
<p>Question 2) What will be the operating temperature of the room?</p>
<p>Answer: The operating temperature of the laboratory will be between 21&deg;C and 24&deg;C.</p>
<p><br />Question 3) What is the desired chamber temperature?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no set desired chamber temperature. The system is designed to reduce fluctuations in temperature to a minimum, not to maintain a predetermined temperature. See the answer to question 1 above.</p>
<p>2. Line Item 0001 is hereby amended to incorporate changes to the technical specifications as follows:</p>
<p>2.1 Specification 3 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:</p>
<p>3. Temperature Control: The temperature inside the chamber shall be controlled by drawing the main lab air through the chamber using a circulation exhaust fan. The operating temperature of the chamber shall be dependent on the temperature of the air in the main lab, the heat generated by the diffractometer, and how much air is drawn through the chamber. The heat generated by the diffractometer cannot be accurately assessed because the x-ray tubes, which are the main source of heat, are water cooled so much of the heat generated by them is removed from the chamber by the chilled water line. The temperature of the chamber shall be actively controlled by monitoring the temperature of the exhaust air and controlling the speed of the fan. The sensitivity of the temperature monitor shall be &plusmn;0.05&deg;C or better. <br />Preference will be given to greater sensitivity.<br />The temperature of the laboratory at a single position near the chamber can be monitored. It is required that the temperature stability of the chamber will be ten times better than the temperature stability of the laboratory; e.g., if the laboratory temperature varies by 2.5&deg;C in a one hour period, the chamber temperature must vary by 0.25&deg;C or less over the same period. There is no humidity control specification for the system. The final operating temperature of the chamber must be between 20&deg;C and 25&deg;C<br />The temperature controlling system shall be software controlled and shall be able to provide a record of the chamber temperature and the laboratory temperature which shall be available by direct data transfer to a computer through a COM port or USB port. The software shall be off-the-shelf software that shall record automatically, every minute, and directly download. The temperature controlling system provided shall work with a personal computer running Windows XP. The Contractor shall provide the necessary cable. It must be possible to disable the active temperature control and directly control the speed of the fan using the software control. A personal computer is not required to be provided as part of the temperature control system. The Government will provide a personal computer with the serial parallel and USB ports.</p>
<p>TO:</p>
<p>3. Temperature Control: The temperature inside the chamber shall be controlled by drawing the laboratory air through the chamber using a circulation exhaust fan. It shall be possible to actively control the temperature inside the chamber with a system that automatically monitors the temperature of the exhaust air and controls the speed of the fan. The sensitivity of the temperature monitor shall be &plusmn;0.05&deg;C or better. Preference will be given to greater sensitivity. It is required that the temperature fluctuations of the chamber (with the door closed) be ten times less than the temperature fluctuations of the laboratory over a one hour period; e.g., if, in a one hour period, the laboratory temperature rises by 2.5&deg;C and then falls to its original temperature, the chamber temperature must fluctuate by 0.25&deg;C or less over the same period. It shall be possible to adjust the control parameters of the temperature control system remotely by computer. The chamber temperature shall be available by direct data transfer to a computer. The temperature controlling system provided shall work with a personal computer running Windows XP. The Contractor shall provide the necessary cable. It must be possible to disable the active temperature control and directly control the speed of the fan using the software control. A personal computer is not required to be provided as part of the temperature control system; the Government will provide a personal computer. There is no humidity control specification for the system.</p>
<p>3. The due date for quotations is hereby extended as follows:</p>
<p>FROM: March 10, 2010 at 3:30 PM Eastern Time<br />TO: March 15, 2010 at 3:30PM Eastern Time</p>

NOTE: Traps and varnish/coating masks are entirely the contractor’s responsibility.

This product shall be manufactured on a lithographic print¬ing press capable of printing all the required colors with one pass through the press and the complete color bar as detailed on page 4 of these spec¬ifications. Do not assume “perfecting” is acceptable to the government. The inspector shall use the following criteria to determine acceptability. If the inspector is unable to determine by examination which side is first down, then press perfecting is acceptable. Web fed printing techniques shall be on dryer equipped presses only.

Ghosting & “in-line problems” shall not be acceptable.

COATING: Overall aqueous coat, satin finish, on outside covers pages 1 and 4 only. A “drytrapped” overall varnish may NOT be substituted.

DISPLAY EXAMINATION: Examination of the furnished materials is an integral part of specifications. No additional payment will be allowed due the contractor’s failure to examine the copy and thoroughly understand the nature and extent of the work to be performed.

PRESS INSPECTION:  Press sheets shall be inspected at the contractor’s printing facility for quality conformance. Each press sheet form must contain one color bar, at least 3/16” in width, for each ink color placed parallel to the ink rollers. Color control bars (such as, BRUNNER, GATF or GRETAG) must contain star targets, trapping, tint and dot gain patches, process built grays, if applicable, and extend the full width of the press sheet. Ink densities shall be constant across the full width of the sheet with no deviations to exceed plus or minus 1/2 of one percent. Light and heavy inking is not allowed. The contractor shall provide the correct viewing conditions for all press sheet inspections including 5000° kelvin light sources housed in a completely enclosed neutral gray-booth and functional densitometers. If the presses are equipped with automatic scanners you are NOT relieved of the requirement for the customer colorbar as detailed above.

PREAWARD SURVEY:  In order to determine the responsibility of the prime contractor, the government reserves the right to conduct a preaward survey, or to require samples to QATAP evaluate, or other evidence of technical, managerial, financial and similar abilities to perform, prior to the award of a contract.

PACKING: Plastic strap or shrink wrap in units of 10 copies only, paper banding shall not be allowed. Turn the items if necessary, to form a “neat” stack.

<DESC>Note: This is the same effort referenced on FedBizOpps # FA8622-09-D-5999-0100.
This notice is a sources sought synopsis with specific interest in small business capability. No solicitation is being issued at this time; while a formal solicitation may be issued at a later date, this notice does not commit the government to ultimately award a contract. The work is for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This notice is prepared in accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This synopsis is published with the intent of determining whether sufficient interest exists to solicit the requirement as a small business set aside under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712, "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)/Aircraft," size standard of 1,500 employees. 
The Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Material Command, intends to award one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity A&AS contract(s) for the work characterized in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). The contract period of performance is anticipated to be five (5) years, with no option periods, and the ceiling is anticipated to be three billion ($3,000,000,000.00) dollars. Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting," applies, wherein "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."
Responses to this synopsis shall include the following information:
1. State your interest in performing in the capacity of the prime contractor or as a subcontractor.
2. State your company's business size and status (including but not limited to: small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, women-owned small business, historically under-utilized business zone (HUBZone) small business) in conjunction with NAICS code 541712, size standard of 1,500 employees.
3. State your company's CAGE code as listed in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR), and a point of contact (POC) name, telephone number, and e-mail address. 
Strategy - One or more ID/IQ contracts would be awarded, comprising a consolidated scope, constituting all studies, projects, deliverables, and Professional and Management Assistance (PMA) for all labor categories contained in the attached draft PWS (the prime contractor and team on each awarded contract would be responsible for performing in all labor categories). Note that this award strategy requires prime contractors to propose on all labor categories. If interested in this award strategy, please respond as stated above and state your industry perspective as to the pros and cons of this approach. 
Do not mark your information "company proprietary" or with any other type of restriction. Any information submitted will become the property of the Government. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. Responses shall be made via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil with courtesy copies to alexander.slate@wpafb.af.mil and laura.bushong@wpafb.af.mil. All pertinent information will be available for viewing at FedBizOpps (FBO), http://www.fbo.gov, and The Preaward Information Exchange System (PIXS), https://pixs.wpafb.af.mil/. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review these sites frequently for updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with FAR 52.204-7, "Central Contractor Registration," lack of registration in CCR, available at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx! , will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. Additionally, in accordance with FAR 52.204-8, "Annual Representations and Certifications," offerors are also reminded to register with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov. Please provide responses by 17 March 2010. Any questions shall be addressed via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil.
Please refer to the current CAPS contract information, Attachment 3, CAPS Contract Labor Categories, 16 Oct 07, for a starting place. Assume the ability to add additional labor categories as needed.
At the present time, another industry day is anticipated once the government is prepared to give more definitive answers regarding strategy intentions. This date is to be determined and industry will be advised of updates.

Renewable Natural Gas/Alternative Methane 

Synopsis: The Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, manager and operator of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is planning to replace fossil fuel natural gas used at its two research campuses located near Golden, Colorado with natural gas from renewable sources. 

The purpose of this sources sought notice is to obtain an expression of interest and capabilities of potential subcontractors and suppliers. 

Background: NREL currently has conventional natural gas fueled combustion equipment.  As part of NREL’s mission to promote renewable energy use and to meet federal mandates to reduce fossil fuel consumption NREL is seeking renewable sources of natural gas derived from biodigesters, landfills, wastewater treatment plants, thermal gasification of biomass, or some other means.  The intent is for renewable methane gas to be produced at the feedstock source and transmitted to NREL using the natural gas pipeline grid.  In concept renewable gas would be similar to purchasing natural gas at the well head and transporting it to the end user.

1)	 Brief background of capabilities.
2)	 Previous relevant experience.
3)	Demonstrated ability to provide NREL with 30,000 dekatherms (dekatherm = 1 million BTU) per year of renewable natural gas/alternative methane and future ability to provide increased renewable natural gas/alternative methane.  Annual usage is expected to increase to 100,000 dekatherms by 2014 at the NREL campus expands.
4)	Delivery capabilities.
5)	Evidence of risk and risk management plan.
6)	Compliance with applicable California Climate Action Reserve protocol
a.	Organic Waste Digestion Project Protocol
b.	Landfill Project Protocol
c.	Livestock Project Protocol
7)	Primary contact person name, address, telephone numbers facsimile number, and email address.

<DESC>The contract modification of Contract SPM75005D7426 is a sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems to extend contract coverage for the NSNs and PNs for the Up Armored HMMWV.  Listed below are the sole source FSCs which we propose to award a 181 day contract: 1005, 1010, 2040, 2510, 2530, 2540, 2590, 2815, 3040, 3110, 3120, 3830, 3990, 4010, 4130, 4210, 4210, 4320, 4710, 4720, 4730, 5305, 5306, 5307, 5310, 5320, 5325, 5330, 5340, 5365, 5930, 5945, 5970, 5975, 5985, 6150, 7690, 9320, 9340, 9515 and 9905. The contract is for a period of 181 days pending the award of the successor solicitation SPM7LX08R0179.  The current contract will expire on March 16, 2010 and this contract will incorporate all technical products and service requirements and contract terms and conditions contained within Contract SPM75005D7426 by a contract modification action. The sole source award by contract modification is being issued through other than full and open competition procedures (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B)) and will expire on September 13, 2010.

There is currently a large Army reset program in the works and any delay in the procurement process will impact readiness of the Up Armored HMMWV fleet.  These vehicles are those that are needed in support of SWA.  The current contract with BAE is helping us maintain a readiness rate of 92%.  With the contract currently in place with BAE, they can support these urgent requirements and can supply these items with a delivery of 5-10 days (depending on Priority code) directly to the customer. It is in the Government’s best interest to make this sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems.

If you should have any questions or concerns about this notice, or if you have an interest in this procurement, please contact Margaret Mickey at 614-692-8868 or email at margaret.mickey@dla.mil.

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought – Wayne County, Nebraska


The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Wayne, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 4173 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3975 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 5/1/2011. The delineated area is bounded or affronted on the

North - 	W/E 21st St
South - 	855th Rd; Hwy 15/576th Ave/Main St; 854th Rd
East - 	Centennial Rd
West – 	575th Ave/Pheasant Run

Other applicable requirements include:

• 33 paved surface parking spaces including 3 official vehicles
• Specific Information Technology requirements

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

•	Building name and address and location of the available space within the building.
•	Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.

•	Date of space availability.
•	Method of rentable space measurement.
•	Building ownership information.
•	Amount of parking available on-site and its cost. Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).

<DESC>Recovery Action. This is notice of the Department of Energy, Golden Field Office award of a several time and material non-competitive purchase orders to various merit reviewers under various Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) during the month of July 2009. The total value of these awards was $372,401.94. These awards were made under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and typically were awarded to small businesses. These purchases were accomplished under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541690. The places of performance are typically at the merit reviewer's location and various conference meeting facilities. The periods of performance are typically one to four months from the date of award.
<p>These requirements are for non-personal commercial services and travel expenses for the merit reviewers. Merit reviewer services are required by the Department of Energy to review proposals submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcements for various Alternative Energy Resource Technology Programs. Merit reviewers also are required to participate in technical merit review meetings to discuss and document results of each individual proposal reviewed and to reach consensus for individual Financial Assistance awards.</p>
<p>Rational for using other than a competitive approach: Merit reviewer services can only be provided from individuals with specialized expert professional experience in the Alternative Energy Resource Program Technology areas of Solar, Geothermal, Biomass, Hydrogen, Wind, Hydro and Industrial Technologies. The available experts who can provide the required merit review technical services is very limited based on the unique qualifications and specific expertise of the Alternative Energy Resource Technology areas. The merit review services ultimately lead to the selection of entities to receive Financial Assistance awards which will create new and innovative approaches pertaining to our countries energy needs. Award to any other sources other than the individuals with specialized expert professional experience in the Alternative Energy Resource Program Technology areas would result in inadequate reviews and recommendations. Additionally, services are required immediately to support the Department of Energy mission.</p>
<p>Rational for using other than a Firm Fixed approach:<br />Time &amp; Material (T&amp;M) purchase orders were utilized because the uncertainties involved could not be identified and quantified with reasonable estimates. A very large volume of financial assistance proposals were expected to be received in conjunction with several new solicitations this year and therefore it was impossible to estimate how many would actually be submitted. A larger number of financial assistance proposals were received by the Department of Energy this year, many more than in any year prior. The proposals were also much more involved. As a result, there was no way to accurately estimate with any accuracy how many hours would be required to complete the individual merit reviews. Therefore, sufficient factual information did not exist at the time of award to permit the use of a Firm Fixed Price contract. No other contract type authorized by FAR 16.000 was suitable. These contractual actions are justified IAW FAR 16.601 Time and Material Contracts.</p>

This solicitation will be awarded in accordance with the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2) as only one responsible source can provide the required services.
<p>The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) has important congressional mandates to set policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and to take appropriate actions that improve the form, content, use, and reporting of assessment results. The Governing Board also has responsibility to plan and execute the initial public release of NAEP reports. One key component for informing the Governing Board's work is through expanded outreach activities involving targeted audiences across the nation. As increased attention is drawn to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, it is important to expand involvement of state policymakers in providing information and input to the Governing Board on various policy initiatives.</p>
<p>NAGB requires the Council of Chief State School Officers Task Force for the National Assessment Governing Board to be convened for&nbsp;two in-person meetings next year and&nbsp;four meetings via webinar. Topics to be discussed by the Task Force include planning for 2010 NAEP reports, releasing reports from the 12th grade NAEP state-level pilot for 2009, 12th grade preparedness issues, achievement level setting, testing students with disabilities and English language learners, use and misuse of NAEP results, and other topics.</p>
<p>In addition, one Task Force member shall attend each of the Governing Board's quarterly meetings as an observer to promote communication between the Board and the Task Force, for a total of&nbsp;four meetings. <br /><br />In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.3-Other Than Full and Open Competition, and under the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source - the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) - can provide the required information and outreach services representing all 50 states and territories within the timelines required for reporting NAEP achievement results. This coordination among all 50 states and the federal government is necessary for NAEP to be successful.</p>
<p>Organizations and persons may identify their interest in and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; NAGB will not issue a solicitation. However, all capability statements received by March 19, 2010,&nbsp;will be considered by the Governing Board. Attached is a draft statement of work. A cost reimbursement type contract is planned. Any questions or suggestions received before March 17, 2010 will be answered via www.fedbizopps.gov. Please submit written questions or comments to <a href="mailto:Moira.Baran@ed.gov">Moira.Baran@ed.gov</a>. The period of performance is from the date of contract award, anticipated to be approximately from September 30, 2010&nbsp;until&nbsp;November 30, 2011.</p>

The United States Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center (WERC) is studying the responses of desert tortoises to habitat altered by wildfire. Purchase of the following equipment is planned, 25 GPS data loggers. The data loggers will be mounted on the scales of tortoises using epoxy glue.
	Part numbers are manufactured by ATS.

The GPS dataloggers that are currently in use at two of our study sites are manufactured by Advanced Telemetry Systems (ATS).  By continuing to use GPS dataloggers developed by ATS, we will be able to use our existing charging and data upload/download equipment, as well as continue to use the programming software needed to deploy our existing dataloggers, and database scripts used to parse and archive data. This will allow us to add additional logging units to our study while maintaining comparable accuracy, data formats, form factor, performance, and durability to the units currently in use.
Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish this or compatible equipment may submit a capabilities statement to the Contract Specialist no later than the closing date of this announcement at 3:00 P.M. Eastern time on 03/16/2010.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  As required by FAR 5.101(a)(1), the forthcoming Request for Quote (10WRQQ0140) will be made available through the GPE on or about 03/16/2010, whether or not competitive opportunities have been identified.

<DESC>Solicitation #W9124N-10-T-0014 was for a grounds maintenance agreement at Pasadena USAR Center, Pasadena TX.  The action was 100% set aside for small-business concerns and was awarded based on low price technically acceptable based on adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  For this action, the successful offeror bid $10,010.00 for the base year.  When the option years were added into the total price, the potential price of the contract, assuming all option years are exercised by the government is $57,730.24.

CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): Lightning Packs, LLC under Contract Number N0001408C0279, P00004 for "Harvesting Electric Power from Walking" project.  The Office of Naval Research has issued a modification using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds to incrementally fund Option I (CLIN 0002) TO CONTRACT N0001408C0279.  This option work seeks to reduce the weight of the electricity-generating backpack and reduce noise generated by the backpack during electricity generation.  The modification provides $371,332 of funding, but only $225,000 of that amount is ARRA funds.  This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price contract because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).

GS-03B-70132</span></span></p>
<p>Proposed Action:<br />To extend the current lease agreement by 6 months to September 7, 2010.</p>
<p>Description of Requirement:<br />The Social Security Administration currently occupies 6,846usf (7,872rsf) of office space at 3400 Aramingo Ave, Philadelphia, PA under Lease No. LPA70132, which expires on March 7, 2010. &lt;REDACTED&gt;.</p>
<p>The agency is remaining at the current location under a new lease contract (LPA09376, awarded on June 22, 2009) and expanding their operation to 8,358usf of office space. The renovations to the space will be extensive and require a phasing plan and overnight work to complete. Construction drawings are complete and bids for the build out of the expansion space and modification of the current space are currently under review by GSA.</p>
<p>Given the impending expiration of the current lease and the complexity of the renovations, there is insufficient time to build the space to substantial completion prior to the expiration of the current lease. A 6-month extension of the current lease agreement is required. The Lessor has agreed to provide an extension at the current rental rate, pending the build out and acceptance by the Government of the space covered under the new lease. The SLA will provide for a 6-month extension of the current lease and will include language indicating that this extension of LPA70132 will expire upon the commencement of the new lease LPA09376 in the event that the renovations are complete prior to the expiration of the extension.</p>
<p>&lt;REDACTED&gt;.</p>
<p>&lt;REDACTED&gt;.</p>
<p>Identification of Statutory Authority: 41U.S.C. 253c(1)</p>
<p>Unique Qualifications of Proposed Contractors of Acquisition Requiring Authority Cited:<br />The Social Security Administration will be remaining at this location under a new lease agreement which will commence upon substantial completion and acceptance of the space.</p>
<p>Determination that Anticipated Cost will be Fair and Reasonable:<br />&lt;REDACTED&gt;.</p>
<p>Description of Market Survey and Results: <br />No market survey was conducted for this extension as it is meant to avoid holdover during build out of space for a signed lease at this location.</p>
<p>Other Factors Supporting Justifications: <br />The agency is remaining in place under a new lease agreement. This extension is meant to avoid a holdover situation while the Lessor completes the renovations required under the new lease.</p>
<p>Listing Sources Expressing Interest in Solicitations:<br />None, as no solicitation was offered.</p>
<p>Future Actions to Overcome Barriers to Full and Open Competition:<br />This extension is meant to avoid holdover during build out and renovation of the office space for Lease No. LPA09376. The new lease was procured through full and open competition. Any follow on leasing action will be competed in the market to the maximum extent practicable.</p>

<DESC>Limited sources justification and approval674-10-2-5265-0561 1.	This is a limited sources justification from:Central Texas Veterans Health Care System1901 Veterans Memorial DriveTemple, TX  76504Under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, pursuant to 8.401 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The Contracting Activity responsible for this action is: VHACTX 2. Nature and/or description of the action:   The action being approved is to conduct extensive Fire Sprinkler System repairs, maintenance and installs in building 163 at the Temple, TX VHACTX facility in accordance with the Scope of Work (SOW).  This will be a Firm Fixed Price order against GSA contract GS-06F-0054N.  Due to this system being directly related to patient and team safety this order is considered urgent and compelling.  In addition, sublet work associated with this action is determined pre-existing as such repairs/corrections are not covered under the current Simplex/Grinnell contract.   3.   A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):  All materials required for this action will be under GSA schedule54N and are defined in the SOW.  Estimated Value is $190,000 USD.4.   An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.    FAR 8.405-6(b)(3)  An urgent and compelling need exists.  5.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.  VHACTX Base Loop Fire Alarm Control Panels in Waco and Temple are manufactured by Simplex/Grinnell and are proprietary systems, as a result the Simplex/Grinnell protocol cannot be maintained or tested by any other perspective contractor.  As a proprietary Fire Alarm Control Panel, the system and software can only be programmed and modified by the manufacturer representative who has been certified and factory trained on that system.  In addition the technician will be utilizing original equipment manufacturer (OEM) proprietary software.5. CONTINUEDThe fire sprinkler system work to be performed under this order must interface with the Simplex/Grinnell Fire Alarm systems installed in VHACTX facilities, building 163 and 204 in order to interface with OEM current systems.  Failure to interface will compromise the system integrity and could result in failure to identify and or extinguish fires.  6.  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.  Due to the proprietary nature of the service, system interfaces and warranty, the work will be solicited to the local authorized Simplex/Grinnell merchant.  By default no other offers are able to be solicited.  Requirement will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities search engine FedBizOpps.gov.   7.  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.The Contracting Officer hereby determines that this action represents the best value to the Government in accordance FAR 8.404(d) in that these actions will be fair and reasonable and in accordance with GSA contract. 8. A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.  Market research identified that due to proprietary nature of the service, system interface and warranty issues, the work will be solicited to the local authorized Simplex/Grinnell dealer.  Market research has indicated no other authorized suppliers.  9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as: None 10.
