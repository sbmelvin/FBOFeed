<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING SOLICITED AS A TOTAL 8(A) SET-ASIDE.
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) anticipates posting a solicitation for proposals for a 62-month (26-month base period with three annual options) cost reimbursement contract to develop software for the Quality and Safety Review System.<br /><br />The solicitation and any documents relating to this requirement will only be available by downloading from the Internet through www.fedbizopps.gov. Interested Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available for downloading on or about 15 days after publication of this synopsis.</p>
<p>This procurement is for the development and maintenance of software. AHRQ will provide all functional specifications at the time of contract award, including: definition of events, report specifications, data to be collected, relationships among data elements, logic to be used in a smart abstracting module, analytic algorithms, rules for calculating quality measures, etc. The contractor shall provide the personnel, facilities, etc. that are necessary to: 1) develop and program these AHRQ-provided specifications into software specifications in sufficient detail to permit programming, coding, testing, and documenting QSRS software, 2) install and maintain the software at AHRQ specified end-user sites, and 3) enhance the software when optional enhancements are required.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to build the AHRQ Quality &amp; Safety Review System ("QSRS"), a modular expandable and multi-functional software platform to permit the collection, analysis, and reporting of specified patient safety and quality of care data. This system will have the capability to support Web-based medical records abstraction for surveillance regarding adverse events that reach the patient as well as to support event reporting at the institutional level. QSRS will replace, as well as expand on the functionality of, the current CMS/AHRQ Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System ("MPSMS") chart abstraction software. QSRS will implement the current version (v1.2) of the AHRQ Common Formats for event reporting in the hospital environment. Thus the Common Formats specifications will be used, incorporating MPSMS measures as appropriate, to support both a medical record abstraction and an event reporting system. Subsequent versions of QSRS may expand on these basic functions to include surveillance of a wider range of quality issues.</p>
<p>AHRQ's Common Formats will form the clinical underpinning of QSRS. They are intended to provide scientifically-supportable clinical definitions that can become the de facto standard for reporting and analyzing patient safety concerns. QSRS is designed to provide a solution for the current variation (identified by, among others, the Office of the Inspector General) that currently exists in reporting, including:<br />&bull; Lack of consistent definitions employed in adverse event reporting systems nationally<br />&bull; Inadequate surveillance that results in capture by current reporting systems of only 14% of adverse events that actually occur (recent OIG report)<br />&bull; Lack of correlation between definitions used in surveillance systems and those used in event reporting systems (except for CDC's NHSN system, which is consistent however it is used).</p>
<p>QSRS is a software system to be used in the CMS Clinical Data Abstraction Center, and designed to comprehensively examine patient safety concerns in the hospital setting. Patient safety concerns include patient safety incidents, near misses, and unsafe conditions. QSRS will have a dual function, supporting a hospital's need to: 1) conduct retrospective medical record review of some or all of a hospital's discharges in order to identify patient safety incidents (a surveillance system); and 2) report and thoroughly examine incidents, near misses, and unsafe conditions (an event reporting system).</p>

<CONTACT>Dwane Dusty Esplin, Contracting, Phone 8017772861, Email dwane.esplin@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This synopsis and notice is posted after evaluation of results from the sources sought synopsis of 1 Aug 2011 which outlined an Air Force requirement for fabrication of miscellaneous sheet metal brackets to support F-16 aircraft hardware kits. Based on market information from that evaluation and other sources, it is the Air Force's intent to set-aside this requirement 100% for participation of small businesses located in a HUB Zone who will compete on the basis outlined below for a Multiple Award Contract (MAC) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) opportunity. Firms who meet this set-aside standard with an operating location certified to be in an identified HUB Zone may submit offers. With the evaluation of offers, the Contracting Officer, at his/her sole discretion, reserves the right to establish a competitive range whereby offerors may be excluded from further competition. This could occur with technical or other findings that within the judgment of the Contracting Officer make the offer un-awardable without extensive revisions, impacting the award schedule to an extent that precludes accommodating the proposal re-write within a reasonable time frame. Past performance information and responsiveness and responsibility of the offeror could inform and influence this decision. Offerors will be given opportunity to respond to adverse past performance information. <br /><br />Applying technical, past performance and cost/price evaluation standards, the Air Force also intends to limit the number of Offers for which a full evaluation will be completed so that no more than four (4) contracts will be awarded. If adequate price competition is not manifest, the contracting officer may require additional cost information to the extent necessary to determine that price(s) are fair and reasonable. The Air Force reserves the right to award a single contract or no contract at all. Offers will be evaluated to a technical standard on a pass/fail basis; relevant past performance will be evaluated in accordance with the instructions to offerors and evaluation criteria in Sections L and M, respectively, of the Request for Proposal (RFP). <br /><br />Cost/price for the first configuration identified will also be evaluated in accordance this RFP, which is an initial bona fide quantity of brackets of a single configuration. These will be "build to print" based on level three (3) or four (4) drawings provided. This initial requirement is referred to hereinafter as the "sample". A single award, funding this sample, will be made to a successful offeror on an initial order at the outset and in conjunction with the basic contract. This order will include a first unit to be submitted for test qualification to the office and ship-to/mark-for address specified in the order and a production quantity subject to test qualification. Funding for a post-award teleconference will also be included. Other successful multiple contract awardees will receive an order funding the post-award teleconference only. These actions will constitute fulfillment of the minimum order guarantee under the FAR clause at 52.216-19 (meeting the requirements of FAR 16.503(c)). <br /><br />Evaluation of the technical proposal, pricing for the initial configuration test and production sample line item, the responsiveness of the offeror to the other terms and conditions of the RFP (including the set-aside requirements) and review of the responsibility and past performance of the offeror will constitute the balance of the initial evaluation. Subject to these limitations, submittals that pass this evaluative hurdle will entitle the respective offeror to an award of an ID/IQ contract under the multiple award approach. This is considered to be a Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection methodology to include a review of past performance. No "trade-offs" or "trade-space" will be applied as part of a best value award decision. <br /><br />Technical proposals will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. The Air Force reserves the right to evaluate pricing for the test and production sample line item and reject offers that are not considered reasonable, based on previous history for similar sample or production articles. No other trade-offs or trade-space versus price is being considered for this baseline evaluation. The Air Force will reserve the right to conduct discussions. <br /><br />Fair opportunity and competitive consideration in accordance with FAR Part 16 will be provided for all awardees for subsequent or future orders for additional brackets based on the initial or a distinct set of specifications to be provided and as requirements are identified by the Air Force within the scope and ordering period established by the basic multiple award contracts. <br />The array of sheet metal brackets, panels, and parts that will be defined and specified during the life of these contracts will range from 1" x 1" x 1" to 3" x 3" x 3". Items can consist of a broad range of bends and shapes, with some requiring hardware installation (DIE, nuts, nut plates, etc...). The range of materials includes but is not limited to various aluminum, steel, and corrosion resistant alloys. Along with the usual cutting, deburring, forming, other processes such as welding, heat treat, age harden, hardness test, anodize, epoxy prime, paint, passivate, install hardware, insert heat shrink, and marking with UID will be required. Quantities could range from 1 to 5000. Work will otherwise be performed in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) attached to the model contract. <br /><br />The government intends to award these basic contracts with five (5) year ordering periods. The solicitation is 100% set aside for certified HUB Zone firms. The official solicitation FA8232-12-R-3007 will be posted on or about 01 May 2012, no less than 15 days subsequent to the date of this synopsis and bidding will close no less than 30 days after that. All responsible HUB Zone firms may submit a proposal which will be evaluated competitively using the LPTA methodology described.

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, the Library of Congress is conducting market research. This Request For Information (RFI) is for planning and market research purposes only and should not be considered as a request for proposal or as a solicitation to do business with the Government. There is no solicitation package available at this time
<p>&nbsp;The purpose of this RFI is to assist us in developing an acquisition strategy,&nbsp; performance work statement, and performance specifications to enhance the operation of wireless devices including cellular phones, smart phones, Blackberry devices, tablets and pagers of the Library of Congress (LOC). In addition, many Library of Congress staff rely on wireless devices to support their own communications needs. Beginning in 2003, the Library installed a Distributed Antennas System (DAS) referred to as the In-Building Wireless System to distribute cellular frequencies to specific spaces of the Library, mainly public spaces frequented by Congressional staff and the public.</p>
<p>The technology employed by the system is also outdated, limiting its capacity, and failing to support higher data rates and advanced wireless protocols. The performance of the system is steadily degrading resulting in permanent loss functions of voice and/or data services of in some spaces of the buildings.</p>
<p>It's the Library's intention to replace the system and upgrade technologies before the system degrades to a level that renders it inoperable for the original requirement. A study for replacement is requested to develop requirements, implementation plans, system design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any of the information furnished pursuant to this RFI request.<br /><br /><br />The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541618, Other Management Consulting Service, and size standard is $7.0 million.<br /><br />Please submit expressions of interest electronically in your own format to include documentation of capabilities in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company and its service possesses the necessary expertise and experience to compete for any acquisitions. <br /><br /><br />Additionally, interested parties are invited to provide best practices or designs to upgrade wireless communication being used in other Government facilities., as well as help us understand trends in technology and how to best prepare for&nbsp;future needs.<br /><br />Please ensure responses do not exceed ten (10) pages. Since this is a Request for Information (Sources Sought Announcement), no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.&nbsp;The due date for submission of this information is 8:00 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Monday, November 14, 2011.

<DESC>DLA Information Operations at New Cumberland PA (J6N) located at San Diego CA has a requirement for a Contractor to provide IT support services for on-site hardware, software, and technical support for approximately 413 employees to augment existing Government IT support personnel. The objective is to ensure that all IT equipment, to include network servers/hardware, workstations, printers, portable computers, network infrastructure (cabling), and other miscellaneous IT equipment are functioning at all times to support mission requirements. These services are mission essential services. DLA Information Operations does not have the expertise in house to perform these services, so contractual services are required.
<p>Contract SP3100-09-C-0001 is currently in place with Bernardo Technical Services, Inc. (BTSI) for the above required services. The contract period of performance ends 19 April 2012. DLA Distribution located at New Cumberland, PA is currently in the process of re-competing the services under solicitation number SP3300-12-R-0010 and anticipates an award date by 1 June 2012.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that a break in services is not experienced, DLA Information Operations would like to issue a sole source contract to BTSI for a period of three months. This award is a sole source award under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) "Only One Responsible Source/a Limited Number of Responsible Sources and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be posted after the execution of the contract. <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541513and the size standard is $25,000,000.00.</p>
<p>To receive an award resulting from solicitations issued after May 31, 1998, your company must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.</p>

The objective of this procurement is to identify and evaluate low cost safety treatments, intended for intersections along rural, two-lane highways, that can currently be characterized as having only limited experience ("tried" or "experimental") and are not yet recognized as common, widespread or state-of-the-practice. At this time, the following treatments are illustrative of what may be considered for evaluation: <br /><br />&bull; geometric modifications (such as smooth lane narrowing using rumble strips or splitter islands), enhanced and/or dynamic forms of existing traffic control devices (pavement markings, signs, flashers, etc.), <br />&bull; new traffic control devices (such as internally illuminated devices), <br />&bull; high friction surface treatments, and <br />&bull; single luminaire intersection identification lighting.<br /><br />The outcome of this project shall be to advance efforts to improve rural, two-lane intersection safety by focusing on strategies that have yet to become widespread or common. The main product of this project shall be an informational report that advances the state of the practice as it concerns innovative safety treatments targeted to two-lane rural, unsignalized intersections. This project will also summarize the evaluated treatments in a technical brief and webinar in order to deploy the results to the target audiences. The target audience for this report will be practitioners from state and local road agencies with jurisdiction over rural, two-lane roadways. Ultimately, this project will result in wider deployment of innovative, effective treatments across the United States, contributing to the overall goal of reducing injuries and fatalities associated with motor vehicle crashes at intersections.<br /><br />The RFP will be released and made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Interested parties may register at the aforementioned site to receive a variety of procurement announcements/notifications. It is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps website for any amendments to the RFP package. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Anton Paar USA in Ashland, VA for the purchase of MCR301 Modular Compact Rheometer.
<p>The existing Ultra Small Angle Neutron Scattering (USANS) Instrument included an Anton Paar UDS200 rheometer which is now in an irreparable state due to age and the inability to find replacement parts. The lab also has an Anton Paar MCR501 rheometer; however, it is too tall and wide to fit within the confines of the current USANS instrument.</p>
<p>The purchase of an Anton Paar MCR301 will be a direct drop-in replacement for the failing UDS200 and will ensure 100% compatibility with the existing equipment. Anton Paar provides unique and proprietary accessories manufactured exclusively for the MCRXX1 series of rhometers allowing concurrent collection of small angle neutron scattering data and rheological data. All accessories currently owned by NIST for the MCR501 rheometer series, such as rotating bobs, and temperature controllers will also work with the MCR301.</p>
<p>The accessories are proprietary in nature and/or have patented features so they can only be purchased from Anton Paar. The MCR301 shall also serve as a backup rheometer should the existing MCR501 ever need repair.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be within three (3) months from date of award and shall be FOB Destination.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by May 1, 2012.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) anticipates that Request for Proposal (RFP) NHLBI-HV-13-09 will be available on or about May 2, 2012.

The Division of Cardiovascular Sciences of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans to establish one (1) Coordinating Center as part of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) renewal. The JHS also involves a Field Center, Training and Education Center and a Community Outreach Center. Awards for the JHS are anticipated to be made on or about June 1, 2013.  

The JHS is a multi-center investigation of predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 5,301 African-Americans living in Hinds, Madison, and Rankin Counties surrounding the Jackson, MS metropolitan area. The JHS represents an expansion of the Jackson, Mississippi site of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study to increase data collection in an African American population, and improve access to and the participation of African American populations and scientists in biomedical research and professions. The JHS was initiated in 1998 as a collaborative effort among three Jackson-area academic institutions. At the close of the current contracts in May 2013, the JHS will have completed three back-to-back cohort examinations that have produced extensive longitudinal data on traditional and putative CVD risk factors, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors and biochemical analytes; measures of subclinical disease from echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans of the heart, aorta and abdomen; and stored biological samples. Eighty-two percent of the surviving JHS participants (N = 4,203) completed Exam 2; projected retention for Exam 3 is 80% (N = 4,082). In addition, the JHS has conducted annual cohort follow-up contacts for incident clinical events of interest, a variety of community education and outreach activities to promote healthy lifestyles to reduce disease risk burden, and level-appropriate academic training programs to promote and support public health research.

The objectives of the renewal of the JHS program are to:
1) Support dedicated time for JHS investigators to conduct data analysis and prepare manuscripts using the wealth of data collected.
2) Facilitate access to study resources and expertise in order to:
 Engage researchers beyond the JHS, including early career investigators, in collaborative analysis of existing data to produce high quality publications.
 Serve as a training ground for undergraduate and graduate students to help ameliorate the shortage of minority biomedical researchers.
 Serve as a platform for ancillary studies.
3) Conduct annual phone interviews with participants to identify interim hospitalizations and outpatient medical visits, convey information about the JHS, and serve as a vehicle to recruit for ancillary studies.
4) Continue clinical events identification, investigation, and validation to improve statistical power for risk prediction and hypothesis testing.
5) Perform community health education activities to disseminate health promotion and prevention messages in the Jackson community.
6)  Prepare all remaining cleaned data, in SAS format (1999-2018), along with necessary documentation for their use and provide all biological specimens collected and maintained.

NHLBI plans to support one (1) Coordinating Center, one (1) Field Center, up to two (2) Training and Education Centers, and one (1) Community Outreach Center. THIS NOTICE ADDRESSES THE COORDINATING CENTER ONLY. 

The Coordinating Center shall be responsible for overall study coordination, communications, data management, data analysis and manuscript production, analytical/statistical support, and publication of important JHS findings in peer-reviewed journals.  The Contractor will maintain via subcontracts or other arrangements a Central Laboratory to manage the JHS stored biological samples; an Image Repository to manage JHS cardiac CT and MRI scans and echocardiograms; a formal collaboration with the ARIC study Coordinating Center for clinical events validation; and other subcontracts as required for study operations.

<p>This service is for use by the entire NIH community having Government-owned Beckman Coulter manufactured instruments of the type specified. NIH authorized ordering officials place orders against this contract directly with the contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions. The contractor shall be responsible for the following types of work under this contract for the appropriate equipment systems/instruments;<br />1) Full service maintenance, including routine preventive maintenance and emergency repair services, and hardware/software revisions and upgrades as well as parts<br />2) Field rotor inspections<br />3) Relocation services</p>
<p>Stored instruments are not covered under this contract.</p>
<p>Service and parts required due to misuse, abuse or damage to the instrument and as a result of causes beyond the control of the contractor, including rotors exceeding the OEM warranty terms, accessories, defective vials, or system contamination are not covered.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible to independently, and not as an agent of the Government, furnish all necessary personnel, labor, special tools, engineering revisions and upgrades, facilities, diagnostic equipment, parts, materials, and supplies to provide the required technical support and expertise for on-site preventive maintenance, inspection and emergency repair.

<DESC>NAVSEA will utilize other than full and open competition to award a class of contract actions to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors (LM MS2) in Moorestown, New Jersey (NJ) for the procurement and integration of ten (10) AEGIS Weapon Systems (AWS) in support of the DDG 51 Class Shipbuilding Program, one (1) AWS equipment set for the AEGIS Ashore Missile Defense System (AAMDS) Host Nation #2 (HN-2) site, and associated engineering services in support of production efforts for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 through FY 2017.

The anticipated contract actions will provide for the production and delivery of  ten (10) AWS equipment ship sets and one (1) for the AAMDS HN-2.  Six (6)  AWS ship sets will be procured as part of a multi-year procurement (MYP) beginning in FY 2013 through FY 2016.
  Four (4) AWS ship sets will be separately priced options in FY 2014, FY 2016, and FY 2017.  The AAMDS HN-2 equipment will be a separately priced option in FY 2014 and FY 2015.   LM MS2 will also be responsible for related technical services to facilitate system testing, shipyard installation, and other requirements.  LM MS2 will be responsible for production and fabrication of the AN/SPY-1D(V) arrays (4 per ship set), including an integrated Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP), AEGIS AMOD Upgrade equipment (AAU), and Combat System Support Equipment (CSSE) for each equipment set.  LM MS2 will also be responsible for integrating the Fire Control System MK 99 for each ship into the AWS, including the MK 82 Directors and MK 200 Director Controls, and the AN/SPY-1D(V) Transmitter Group delivered under separate contracts and performing full functional testing of the complete AWS at the PTC.
  Once AWS system level testing at PTC is complete, each AWS ship set will be delivered to the designated shipyard for installation into the new construction DDG.  LM MS2 will also be responsible for system engineering and technical services in support of the manufacturing process.

LM MS2 is the only responsible source capable of satisfying the Navys  requirements for delivery of ten (10) complete, fully functionally tested AWS ship sets and AAMDS HN-2 including production of the AN/SPY-1D(V) arrays, MMSP, AAU and CSSE.   LM MS2 possesses unique experience in AWS design, development, production, assembly, and testing, and currently provides the necessary services to deliver an integrated and tested AWS to the fleet.
  LM MS2 also provides installation material, ancillary equipment, provisioning items, administrative data, technical data, and provisioning technical data.  As such, LM MS2 understands the system functionality and detailed specifications in order to produce systems that satisfy the AWS requirements and are compatible with existing components and infrastructure of the entire AEGIS Combat System (ACS), of which the AWS is one component.  All previous AWS production contracts for ship sets and AAMDS sites equipment have been awarded on a sole-source basis to LM MS2 (or its antecedents).     Under these contracts, LM MS2 has developed an extensive infrastructure at its Moorestown, NJ facility to support AWS production.
  This infrastructure (production facilities, qualified supplier base, special test equipment, data networks, system test environments, producibility engineering workstations, etc.) also supports the separate LM MS2 contractual responsibilities for AEGIS development, FMS AWS production, U.S. Navy and FMS in-service engineering, and other depot operations.  Because this infrastructure supports other ongoing contractual responsibilities, the Navy could not transfer it to another contractor for performance of these requirements.  LM MS2 is the only existing source with the in-depth technical expertise, knowledge, resources, and infrastructure to produce, integrate, and test the AWS without adverse impact to deliveries in support of the USN shipbuilding schedule, ship deployment requirements for operational use, and MDA delivery schedule.
  

For the reasons stated above, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to award a contract for the production, integration, testing and engineering support services for production, integration and test of the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) for DDGs and HN-2 to Lockheed Martin Mission Systems & Sensors (LM MS2) in Moorestown, NJ. Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact LM MS2 directly.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
 This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Please review the above description and all comments and questions should be submitted in writing electronically to Ms. Jennifer L.
 Thompson, Contracting Officer, via email at jennifer.l.thompson1@navy.mil in lieu of telephone calls.  Do not phone in any questions or comments, they will not be considered.

<DESC>NAVSEA will utilize other than full and open competition to award a class of contract actions to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems in Tewksbury, Massachusetts (MA) for the production of ten (10) AN/SPY-1D(V) Transmitter Groups and Fire Control System (FCS) MK 99 equipment sets in support of the DDG 51 Class Shipbuilding Program, one (1) AN/SPY-1D(V) Transmitter Group and selected FCS MK 99 equipment for the AEGIS Ashore Missile Defense System (AAMDS) Host Nation #2 (HN-2) site, and associated engineering and technical services in support of production efforts for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 through FY 2017.

The anticipated contract actions will provide for delivery of ten (10) AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group and FCS MK 99 Mod 14 equipment sets for DDG ship sets and one (1) AN/SPY-1D(V) Transmitter Group and selected FCS MK 99 equipment for the AAMDS HN-2 site.
  Six (6) AWS equipment ship sets will be procured as part of a multi-year procurement (MYP) beginning in FY 2013 through FY 2016.  Four (4) AWS ship sets will be separately priced options in FY 2014, FY 2016 and FY 2017.  The AAMDS HN-2 equipment will be procured as a separately priced option in FY 2014.  Raytheon IDS will also be responsible for related technical services to facilitate system testing, shipyard installation, and other requirements.  The Transmitter Group consists of Radio Frequency (RF) driver and amplification cabinets, an RF monitoring cabinet, high voltage power supplies, and isotransformers. The transmitter group provides high power RF energy for use by the radar to support its primary function of target detection and tracking.
  The transmitter group also supports the generation of the missile data link for communication with missiles while in flight.  The shipboard FCS equipment set consists of Continuous Wave Illuminator (CWI) elements, waveguide elements between the transmitter and antenna, and two (2) data conversion cabinets (DCCs).  The FCS CWI elements provide high power, stable RF energy to support semi-active missiles in the terminal phase of flight.  The AAMDS FCS equipment will consist of a single DCC with a Kill Assessment System (KAS) ORDALT 74588.   After production, the DDG Transmitter Group and FCS MK 99 ship sets will be shipped to the Production Test Center (PTC) in Moorestown, New Jersey (NJ) for integration with the remainder of the AWS and system level testing by Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors (LM MS2).
  The AAMDS HN-2 equipment will undergo cabinet and sub-system level testing at Raytheon prior to delivery to Missile Defense Agency (MDA) as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for further integration and system level testing.

Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Raytheon IDS is the only responsible source capable of satisfying the Navys requirements for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group, FCS MK 99, and related technical services.  Raytheon IDS is the current and only qualified source as the manufacturer, assembler, and design agent for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group and FCS MK 99.  The company is responsible for completing AEGIS Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex (AAMDTC) equipment at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) and all AWS new construction requirements related to this equipment for those DDGs still within the SCN window (DDG 110 through 116) and related back-fit requirements for CG/DDG Class ships.
  Raytheon also develops configuration modifications which serve as the foundation for all forward fit changes or upgrades to new construction DDGs and the AAMDS.  Raytheon has been the prime production contractor for the AN/SPY-1 Transmitter Group since the first contract was awarded for the AWS effort in 1969.  As the design agent for the FCS MK 99, Raytheon has also been the principal subcontractor to LM MS2 for past transmitter and FCS modification developments. Under separate contracts, Raytheon IDS is developing transmitter group and FCS upgrades for the AEGIS AMOD Upgrade (AAU) program and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) baseline 5.0, all of which will be part of DDG AWS ship sets and AAMDS HN-2 configurations.
  Raytheon IDS is the only existing source that has the specific production engineering background, extensive integration and test facilities, prior FCS MK 99 and AN/SPY-1D(V) transmitter group experience, and in-depth technical expertise to produce the equipment without adverse impact to scheduled AWS deliveries in support of the USN shipbuilding, and ship deployment requirements for operational use, and the AEGIS Ashore site installation schedule.   

For the reasons stated above, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to award a contract for the production, integration, testing and engineering support services for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group and MK99 Missile Fire Control System (MFCS) for DDGs and AAMDS HN-2 to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) in Tewksbury, MA.
 Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon directly.

<DESC>Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Enforcement, Permitting and Assistance (REPA) V Zone 3.
PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS:  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.
The purpose of this synopsis is to notify potential offerors of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management's (OAM's) intent to issue a competitive full and open solicitation to provide technical support services to the EPA Zone 3, which is comprised of EPA Regions 7, 8, 9 and 10. The contracts will support EPA activities, as well as EPA coordinated efforts with states, tribes and other Federal agencies, at private, state and federal facilities, Indian Country, U.S. Territories, along the United States international borders, and further abroad. The activities required under this contract will support the RCRA goals cited above and other programs or related Agency initiatives.
Under the authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and in cooperation with EPA's state and tribal partners, EPA manages a hazardous waste program, an underground storage tank program, and a solid waste program, including development of waste reduction strategies such as recycling. The goals of the RCRA program are to: 1) Protect human health and the environment from the hazards posed by waste disposal; 2) Conserve energy and natural resources through waste recycling and recovery; 3) Reduce or eliminate the amount of waste generated, including hazardous waste; and 4) Ensure that waste is managed in an environmentally safe manner. 
RCRA is the result of several laws. Congress passed the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) in 1965.  This statute provided the basis for regulating the proper management of solid waste.  The SWDA went through several major amendments resulting in the RCRA of 1976. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) in 1984 and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act of 1992 have also amended RCRA. 
To achieve RCRA program goals, four distinct yet interrelated programs exist under RCRA.  Subtitle D of RCRA promotes and encourages the environmentally sound management of solid waste.  It includes minimum Federal technical standards and guidelines for state solid waste plans.  Subtitle C establishes a management system that regulates hazardous waste from the time it is generated until its ultimate disposal, in effect, from "cradle to grave."  Subtitle I regulates petroleum products and hazardous substances (as defined under Superfund) that are stored in underground tanks.   It establishes performance standards for new tanks and requires leak detection, prevention and corrective action at underground tank sites.  Subtitle J regulates medical waste generation, treatment, destruction, and disposal.      
In conjunction with achieving the RCRA program goals, other programs or related Agency initiatives may be addressed within this performance work statement.  This includes the following programs and initiatives: Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA), Toxic Substance and Control Act (TSCA), Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation Challenge (RCC), Pollution Prevention (P2), National Environmental Performance Track (NEPT), Environmental Management Systems (EMS), Border 2012, Environmental Justice (EJ), National Environmental Justice Advisory Committee (NEJAC), Community Based Environmental Protection (CBEP), Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know (EPCRA), RCRA Brownfields, and other new initiatives and special programs
It is the Government's intent to award two (2) Time-and-Materials, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) from this solicitation through full and open competition.  The Government will issue competing Task Orders from the resulting contracts.  The anticipated ordering period includes a twelve (12) month Base Period, and four (4), twelve (12) month option periods with a maximum potential ordering period totaling sixty (60) months.  
The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7 Million.  This is not a request for submission of proposals.  The solicitation for this procurement is anticipated to be released on or about May 1, 2012 with an award anticipated on or about July 15, 2012.  The closing response date will be 30 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation.  This procurement will be conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 - Contracting by Negotiation.  The contract award will be made using a best value approach, with technical capability being of greater importance than cost or price. 
The synopsis, amendments, and other information related to this procurement as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website, at:  https://www.fbo.gov/  and the EPA website, at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm.  All interested parties should check these sites frequently for updates. 
All inquiries and questions regarding this solicitation shall be submitted in writing to James Langan, Contracting Officer, at langan.james@epa.gov. TELEPHONE CALLS REGARDING THIS PROCUREMENT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

The activities required under this contract will support the RCRA goals cited above and other programs or related Agency initiatives.

RCRA is the result of several laws. Congress passed the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) in 1965.  This statute provided the basis for regulating the proper management of solid waste.  The SWDA went through several major amendments resulting in the RCRA of 1976. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) in 1984 and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act of 1992 have also amended RCRA. 
To achieve RCRA program goals, four distinct yet interrelated programs exist under RCRA.  Subtitle D of RCRA promotes and encourages the environmentally sound management of solid waste.  It includes minimum Federal technical standards and guidelines for state solid waste plans.  Subtitle C establishes a management system that regulates hazardous waste from the time it is generated until its ultimate disposal, in effect, from ?cradle to grave?.  Subtitle I regulates petroleum products and hazardous substances (as defined under Superfund) that are stored in underground tanks.   It establishes performance standards for new tanks and requires leak detection, prevention and corrective action at underground tank sites.  Subtitle J regulates medical waste generation, treatment, destruction, and disposal.      
In conjunction with achieving the RCRA program goals, other programs or related Agency initiatives may be addressed within this performance work statement.  This includes the following programs and initiatives: Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA), Toxic Substance and Control Act (TSCA), Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation Challenge (RCC), Pollution Prevention (P2), National Environmental Performance Track (NEPT), Environmental Management Systems (EMS), Border 2012, Environmental Justice (EJ), National Environmental Justice Advisory Committee (NEJAC), Community Based Environmental Protection (CBEP), Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know (EPCRA), RCRA Brownfields, and other new initiatives and special programs
It is the Government's intent to award a Time-and-Materials, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract from this solicitation through a small business set-aside.  The Government will issue task orders from the resulting contract.  The anticipated ordering period includes a twelve (12) month Base Period, and four (4), twelve (12) month option periods with a maximum potential ordering period totaling sixty (60) months.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Energy Research Incorporated (ERI) for technical and scientific disciplines relating to tasks accomplishing tasks aimed at ensuring overall safety, security and adequacy of nuclear power plant design, construction and operations. The items being purchased through this posting will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation. The period of performance for this technical services support is five (5) years. The authority for negotiating on a sole-source basis with IBM is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, which provides for limiting competition from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 (Size Standard: $14 Million). This action is for technical assistance services relating to the new license applications for GE Hitachi ABWR. ERI possesses unique experience and expertise on this specific design center and familiarity with the application reviews under those designs over the past four years, combined with their integral role assisting in the entire review process up to preparation of Safety Evaluation Reports qualifies those organizations as the only contractors that can complete reviews related to the various design centers in a time-efficient manner. An award to any other commercial entity would result in duplication of cost to the NRC that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Further, the current scope of work creates an environment where potential bidders with little or no NRC licensing experience would further delay project schedules. This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address not later than 15 calendar days from the date this announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered. To review a list of the software product bundle NRC intends to purchase, please contract the contract specialist.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), is seeking a qualified U.S. architectural/engineering (A/E), joint venture or other such entity, to provide comprehensive A/E design services for a new residential facility in Paris, France. This will be a design-bid-build project. The resultant contract shall be fixed price. This is an unclassified project; a security clearance is not required. The estimated construction cost is in the range of $22-25 million. <br />
<p>The new residential annex will be approximately 800 to 900 gross square meters in area and will include living quarter space for 12 embassy personnel. In addition, there will be an underground parking garage to hold approximately 90 vehicles. The project will also include new perimeter and vehicular/pedestrian screening facilities. The residential annex will be constructed on a U.S. government-owned property located in a central urban neighborhood; on a constrained site near the U.S. Embassy; and subject to local historic preservation controls.</p>
<p>This DOS project shall demonstrate the value of integrated design balancing aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, and following the Guiding Principles of Design Excellence in Diplomatic Facilities (www.state.gov/obo). This project will be designed and constructed to exemplify the highest standards of sustainability.<br /><br />The A/E services required include work involving architectural, landscape and engineering disciplines for an overseas diplomatic facility. At a minimum, additional expertise will be required in: communications; security; specialized structural design; sustainable design; space planning and interior design; food service planning; vertical transportation; lighting design; reliability centered maintenance; design and construction scheduling; cost estimating; and value engineering.</p>
<p>The successful offeror will be required to have an approved local design consultant. Identifying the local consultant is not required at this time. Information on the local consultant requirement will be provided to the successful offeror when the request for proposal is issued. U.S. codes and USG requirements will apply as will applicable local zoning and/or building codes.</p>
<p>The site, buildings, and related facilities, will be designed in hard metric (system International) units. Construction documents shall be submitted with AutoCAD Release 2008 or higher and REVIT Architecture 2008. The successful offeror will be required to use OBO ProjNet for the electronic transmission of Sensitive But Unclassified USG information.</p>
<p>A two-stage process shall be used in the award selection, as follows:</p>
<p>In Stage 1, prospective offerors will submit a portfolio of accomplishments that establish the design capabilities of the A/E firm and the Lead Designer. The Pre-Selection Board (PSB) will establish a short-list of offerors to be further considered in Stage 2.</p>
<p>In Stage 2, upon notification offerors will assemble their technical and local consultant teams. The offerors will submit detailed information on their organization and qualifications. Offerors' submittals will be point-scored by the PSB based on evaluation criteria provided by OBO at the conclusion of Stage 1. The Stage 2 offerors and OBO will be required to travel Paris, France for a general orientation and overview of the site (information to be provided in Stage 2). A fixed stipend, in an amount yet to be determined, but intended to defray the costs of the travel costs, will be provided to offerors in Stage 2. After the site visit/orientation, the short-listed offerors will be required to make presentations to the PSB, most likely at State Annex Six located in Arlington, Virginia.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends tosolicit and award acompletion type contract, with a cost-plus-fixed-pricepricingarrangement, and a one-year period of performance, on a sole source basis toLiquid Robotics Inc. (LRI), of  1329 Moffett Park Drive, Sunnyvale CA, 94089-1134.LRI developed, at private expense, the Wave Glider.  LRI's Wave Glider is ahybrid sea-surface wave glider comprised of a submerged "glider" that isattached via a tether to a surface float. The vehicle is propelled by theconversion of ocean wave energy into forward thrust, independent of wavedirection. No electrical power is generated by the propulsion mechanism.  TheLRI Wave Glider possess the following attributes: two man portable andcapable of unsupported autonomous missions of up to 10 months duration,long distance transits of up to 1000 nautical miles in the open ocean, constantsea-surface expression, solar energy harvesting during daylight hours,propulsion via wave power harvesting at all vehicle-to-wave headings,commandable vehicle heading and autonomous on-board navigation to a givenand reprogrammable lat/long waypoint on the ocean's surface, instrumentationpayloads of 20 pounds in air, power generation in support of instrumentationrequirements of 10 watts, sustained thrust adequate under own propulsionsufficient to tow loads having steady-state drag forces of 10 lbsf andtransientdrag forces of 20 lbsf, survivability in sea states up to 5 and winds to 50knots,minimal radar return, low likelihood of visual detectability, minimal radiatedacoustic noise, and available tow point greater than 12 feet below sea surface.SSC Pacific has developed the Sensor Hosting Autonomous Research Craft(SHARC) Unmand Surface Vehicle (USV) Towed Array Integrated "L" (TAIL); aspecialized passive towed acoustic array specifically tailored to LRI's WaveGlider lower unit or "glider".  SSC Pacific requires the development of acustomelectronics housing, custom umbilical cable, and logistical coordination tofurther integrate the SSC Pacific SHARC TAIL and the LRI Wave Glider. SSCPacific will also require at-sea system testing support for  the SSC PacificSHARC TAIL project in developing an autonomous acoustic sensor system.Specifically, the at-sea testing will demonstrate and validate thevehicle/sensorintegration and verify acceptable acoustic towed array performance while undertow.Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) andFAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements.  LRI's technology developed at private expensemakes it the only source that would not result in the substantial additionalcostto the government.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitiveproposals.  Interested persons may identify their interest and submit acapability statement.  All capability statements received  within 15 days afterdate of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  Adetermination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contractbased upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of theGovernment.  Information received will normally be considered solely for thepurpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.Questions concerning this sole source contract action may be directed toChristopher J. Murr at Christopher.j.murr@navy.mil.

<p><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Department of the Air Force, OO-ALC/GHAK, 6072 Fir Ave BLDG 1233, Hill AFB, UT, 84056</p>
<p><strong>Description<br /></strong>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information. The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify sources that meet Air Force requirements. This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. There will be no reimbursement for the information provided. This Sources Sought is for A-10 Daniels Kit (NSN 5180-01-045-1821/Part Number DMC239E) acquisition. <br />The A10 Aircraft Division, Hill AFB is seeking to find small business contractors that can provide DMC239 E highly specialized toolkit and DMC1921 backshell kit that was designed and built to support A-10 Aircraft maintenance activities. The A-10 Aircraft has complicated electrical wiring systems containing many different connectors, contacts and terminals. The repair of these systems requires specialized tools/tooling. Once an aircraft becomes non mission capable due to a connector failure, it is imperative to be able to replace a connector as quickly as possible. The DMC239E toolkit supplies Air Force maintenance personnel with the information and tools necessary to make a repair in the shortest time possible. It consists of specialized crimping tools, positioners, insertion tools, removal tools, wire strippers, probes, holding fixtures, wire wrap tools and contact gages. The kits are supplied in a durable tool cabinet and includes foam pads/inserts, contents chart, instruction charts, and tool selection information. Since all the tools are located together in a single kit (with operating instructions and connector cross reference guides), it eliminates costly and time consuming research to identify the proper tool to use.</p>
<p>Daniels Manufacturing Corporation (DMC) is the original equipment manufacturer of this item with design control, authorization, and documentation to manufacture the DMC239E and DMC1921. DMC has limited data rights to this item. The Air Force does not have the drawings.<br /><br />An offeror that has previously manufactured this or a similar toolkit, used in several aircraft, may submit a "Source Approval Request" (SAR). If you have any questions please send them to Ryan.hale@hill.af.mil and we will respond as soon as an answer can be obtained.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer<br /></strong>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary or competition sensitive will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. The responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>

<p>Description:</p>
<p>This represents a market survey (preliminary market research) for the Southern Field Contracting Operations Division which is seeking to identify qualified and responsible 8(a) business concerns with the technical competency to perform closing agent services for the sale of HUD-owned single family (1-4 units) properties in Northern Florida which comprised of Gainesville, Jacksonville, Pensacola, and Tallahassee in which consist of the following counties: Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Calhoun, Clay, Columbia, Dixie, Duval, Escambia, Flagler, Franklin, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Marion, Nassau, Okaloosa, Putnam, Santa Rosa, St. Johns, Suwannee, Taylor and Union, Wakulla, Walton, and Washington under the jurisdiction of the HUD Atlanta Homeownership Center, Real Estate Owned Branch located in Atlanta, Georgia. <br />The scope of this requirement includes all aspects of real estate property sales closing services.

<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), administers the Single Family Mortgage Insurance Program. Upon default and foreclosure of an FHA insured loan, the lender files a claim for insurance benefits. In exchange for payment of a claim, a lender conveys a foreclosed property to HUD. HUD, through a Management and Marketing (M&amp;M) contractor, then manages and sells a sizable inventory of single family homes in a manner that promotes home ownership, preserves communities and maximizes return to the FHA insurance fund. To complete the sales of the properties, HUD requires the services of closing agent contractors (referred to as "contractor" hereafter) to perform all necessary closing activities on its behalf.</p>
<p>Performance under this contract will involve interaction with homebuyers and their representatives in the real estate community, mortgage lenders, non-profit housing and advocacy organizations, staff from HUD's Homeownership Center (HOC), and other service providers under contract to HUD such as the M&amp;M contractors. Additionally, this contract may be impacted by changes in regulation or legislation, and housing policy initiatives identified by the White House or the HUD Secretary.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information - Market Research<br />Distribution and Warehousing Assessments<br />Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Distribution
<p><br />Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Distribution J7 is issuing this Market Research Request for Information (RFI) for information gathering purposes only. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit industry's assistance and best practices to understand the elements/tasks that would comprise a comprehensive industrial engineering assessment/analysis of distribution and warehousing operations and systems.</p>
<p>As a result of this RFI, DLA Distribution is requesting a technical capabilities statement, samples of Statements of Work (SOW) and any additional information that pertains to the subject outlined in the RFI. The information gathered as a result of this RFI will be used to assist DLA Distribution in determining how an assessment requirement should be structured and what components are necessary to ensure final assessment documentation affords DLA Distribution the ability to successfully evaluate current facilities/operations for optimization. The industrial engineering assessment will focus on existing facilities/operations as opposed to new construction. One of the key deliverables that DLA Distribution has identified is simulation modeling that would duplicate the current distribution operation and equipment.</p>
<p>Background: DLA Distribution manages twenty-six (26) distribution facilities worldwide in support of the military services. This frame work is comprised of both distribution and warehousing operations. DLA Distribution worldwide facilities receive, store and issue material including off loading, processing and routing, inspection, classification, warehousing, packaging and transportation planning. DLA Distribution facilities and operations range in size and type. The warehouse facilities are comprised of various levels of automation. The material stored and moved varies greatly. Various types of storage aids are also utilized for warehoused material. The age of the material handling systems being utilized range from "recently installed" to "over 35 years of utilization". Due to the age of current material handling systems and changes in mission requirements, several distribution facilities require an assessment.</p>
<p>Information Requested: The Distribution and Warehouse facilities within DLA Distribution range from Small (200,000 SF) to Large (2 million SF). Furthermore, the operations and processes range from manual to fully automatic. Therefore, the information provided in response to this RFI should be for the following two scenarios:<br />a) Large (approximately 2 million SF) Distribution Center with a high degree of automation. <br />b) Small (approximately 200,000 SF) Warehouse Operation with a low degree of automation.</p>
<p>1) Technical Capabilities Statement Response Format:<br />The Contractor shall provide the following information in their technical capabilities statement:</p>
<p>a) Company information to include the company size/socio-economic status, the Commercial and <br />Government Entity (CAGE) code, and the Point of Contact (POC) information (name, email <br />address, telephone and fax numbers);<br />b) Background/Corporate Experience;<br />c) Past Performance references, to include POC information for each reference (not to exceed 5 <br />pages total).<br />2) Assessment Services Provided: Describe the type of services your company provides for assessment of existing Distribution and Warehousing operations.</p>
<p>3) Simulation Modeling: Describe your company's capabilities and expertise with simulation modeling. Describe the features/benefits of the simulation modeling performed by your company. Contractors are advised not to submit the simulation software product. The Government will not evaluate/test simulation software products under this RFI. Any simulation software products submitted will be immediately returned by the Government to the Contractor.</p>
<p>Since simulation modeling will be a key deliverable, DLA Distribution may request Contractors who have identified the use of simulation modeling in a distribution and warehousing environment provide a demonstration of their simulation modeling either via Video Teleconference (VTC) or in person at DLA Distribution Susquehanna in New Cumberland, Pennsylvania at no cost to the Government.</p>
<p>4) Creation of Statement of Work (SOW): What are the key components that should be incorporated into a SOW that will enable a Contractor to understand and accurately submit a quotation on a solicitation that includes requirements for a wall to wall assessment of a specific warehouse and distribution facility? Submissions of samples of SOW are requested.</p>
<p>5) Data Required in an Assessment: In performing an industrial engineering assessment, what data (itemize) is customarily provided by the client and what data is obtained (developed or studied) by the Contractor? What data or information is required to understand the current state of the operation? What baseline indicators and information are to be identified in order to perform the assessment?</p>
<p>6) Estimated Hours Required: DLA Distribution realizes that numerous variables will affect the number of hours required to perform an assessment. However, based on experience/expertise, how much time (estimated hours) would be required to perform an assessment? Provide information concerning the size of the facility, type of operations within the facility, key objectives of the assessment and the quantity of hours expended in performance of the assessment. Provide estimated hours by labor category (i.e. Project Lead, Lead Analyst, Analyst, Industrial Engineer, etc.) and project step/milestone. <br />7) Assessment Results: Provide samples of completed assessments and results that address improvement to workflow layout; economy in human effort; improvements in the use of materials, machines, automation and manpower.</p>
<p>8) Miscellaneous: Provide "lessons learned", "best practices" and any additional information that will assist DLA Distribution concerning distribution and warehousing assessments.</p>
<p>This RFI does not in any way constitute a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and as such, shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, nor otherwise pay for proposal preparation costs supporting submission of a response to this RFI. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>Contractors providing information under this RFI may be afforded the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to an issued RFQ. In combination with additional market research, the Contracting Officer may evaluate Contractor size/socio-economic status for set-aside considerations.</p>
<p>All sources capable of providing these services are requested to respond to this RFI announcement via email by submitting their responses to David R. Gilson, Acquisition Specialist via email at david.gilson@dla.mil by May 17, 2012 12:00, p.m. EST. Please provide response in PDF or MS Word format and reference RFI-Distribution and Warehouse Assessments in the subject of your e-mail.</p>
<p>Please be advised that all information received in response to this notice will be considered procurement sensitive and will be handled accordingly. However, any information the contractor considers to be proprietary pursuant to existing laws and regulations should be marked in accordance with FAR 2.101 and 3.104-1.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Coherent Genesis Laser CX355-250 Laser or EQUAL which is required for the development of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroelectrochemisty. The laser is required to interface with the EPR spectrometer system in order to photoexcite materials used in solar fuels research in situ while EPR and photocurrent measurements are being made to develop an ODMR measurement using a reporter probe. <br />The laser shall have a high power because NIST anticipates significant power losses due to the cryostat and resonator configurations in the EPR spectrometer. Finally, the high optical density of the samples requires high power illumination to generate sufficient concentrations of paramagnetic species for detection by EPR spectroscopy. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the laser that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
<p>NIST requires a Coherent Genesis Laser CX-355-250 Laser or EQUAL. The salient characteristics are the following:</p>
<p>1) Continuous wave, 355 nm wavelength, output power of at least 200 mW.</p>
<p>2) Single transverse mode (TEM00) with M.sq. of at most 1.2. Product of (1/e^2) beam diameter and angular divergence of less than or equal to 1.2 mm mrad.</p>
<p>3) Output (rms) power stability less than 1% peak to peak with output noise (rms) of less than 0.2 % in the frequency range 10 Hz to 1 MHz.</p>
<p>4) Linear output polarization with polarization ratio of at least 100:1.</p>
<p>5) Power supply with output power display and adjustable output (laser) power.</p>
<p>6) One-year warranty</p>
<p>7) Brand new (not used)</p>
<p>8) Shall be able to be coupled to fiber optic cables</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socioeconomic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture lasers are requested to email a detailed response describing their abilities to Prateema.carvajal@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The response should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.

In addition, the workstations shall accommodate the closure and transport of the shelter (including workstation components) in its ISO container configuration.  The Marine Corps requirements and most desirable attributes for interchangeable workstations are:

(a) COTS designs with minimal integration required that shall accommodate the workstations within a 3:1 expandable rigid wall ISO shelter.  (ISO shelter internal dimensions:  Expanded/Operational Mode- 184L x 216W x 71H; Closed/Transport Mode- 191L x 65W x 71H).
 
(b) The workstation and its components shall be modular and mobile and shall enable placement and utilization when the 3:1 is expanded.
  Additionally, they shall have the ability to be locked in place during transport mode. 

(c) While in transport mode, the workstation and its components, in their lockdown position, shall meet the standard military mobility and transportability requirements (MIL-STD-810G, Ref 11 (Ground Mobility); MIL-STD-810G, Test Method 526 (Rail Impact); and MIL-STD-810G, Test Method 516.6 Procedure IV (Transit Drop).

(d) Allow for efficient use of shelter space in operational mode by providing maximum workstation surface area while meeting the required number of twelve (12) workstations per rigid wall shelter.

(e) The workstation and its components shall be portable, easily interchangeable, and lockable.
  The workstation and its components shall have a means to tie and strap down equipment on shelves and work surfaces for transport.

(f) The workstation and its components shall have corners on all shelves/racks/benches/cabinets that minimize bump and snag injuries. 

(g) Each workstation shall have its own power strip with a minimum of four National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) 5-15 receptacles, telecommunication capability, Ethernet, RF, GPS and Fiber Optic lines capability, and amperage and voltage monitoring capability.

(h) The workstation and its components shall have electrostatic discharge (ESD) compliant work surfaces and storage racks.

(i) The workstations shall have their own source of energy efficient bench-top lighting.

Those vendors who believe they have a product capable of meeting these requirements are requested to provide two (2) copies of the following: product literature, brochures, test data (if available), price lists, warranty coverage, capability, all past performance history, and any other relevant information.
  

In addition, vendors are requested to provide information regarding business size, in order to evaluate whether any future solicitation should be issued as a total small business, set-aside under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19.502-2 or as a Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business, set-aside under authority of FAR Part 19.1305.  Any HUBZone offer submitted shall be in compliance with FAR 52.219-3 and 52.219-14.

<CONTACT>Anthony O Salas, Contract Specialist, Email asalas@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action Synopsis. There is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will receive no response. This Proposed Contract Action is published to notify potential sources that The Rocky Mountain Research Station intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract, on behalf of the USDA Forest Service, to GCS Research, LLC for optimizing modeling of fire fighting resources and possible follow up services.
<p>Background: The Forest Service initiates research projects for the purpose of optimizing use and placement of fire fighting resources (crews, aircraft, engines etc.). Scientists and staff at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory (FiSL) have been developing components of this optimization process but require programming support to integrate them and complete the research cycle in evaluating how well the optimization works. <br />The existing components include: <br />1. Fire ignition generator (FIG) using historical fire occurrence data and modeled weather<br />2. Initial attack (IA) model that uses the FIG together with resource attributes (location, type etc.) and dispatch logic to simulate fire fighting <br />3. Neural-network programming to drive the IA with different configurations of resources and depict the responses for use with different budget targets and performance constraints. <br />The programming requires integrating these components and producing a research-level graphical interface for testing, displaying and debugging. Given the timeframe for this project (completed by June 2013), ready and detailed knowledge of fire behavior modeling, fire behavior and weather inputs, spatial mapping and display, and multi-platform toolsets to support different operating systems is required to be successful. <br /><br />Tasks:<br />1. Produce a monthly report detailing activities initiated and completed, status of each activity and hours utilized in the task categories, as broken out below. <br />2. Adapt FS-supplied existing code used for calculating fire behavior for the artificial fire seasons generated by the Fire Ignition Generator (FIG). This involves ingesting the table of ignitions (and their attributes, e.g. time, date, location), a spatial landscape file containing fuel and terrain data, and weather summaries from gridded modeling to produce fire behavior characteristics for each ignition from FlamMap or derived fire behavior model code. <br />3. Adapt FS-supplied existing code for the initial attack model (IA) to permit user-specified geographic areas, configurations and geographic locations of firefighting resources, dispatch logic, and FIG data. <br />4. Integrate an existing neural net heuristic solver with the IA module such that it will run user-specified numbers of IA runs for specified ranges of the input variables, store the suite of inputs and results in an on-disk database (for re-running as necessary), display queries from this database in graphical and tabular form, display results geographically for the analysis area, and identify solutions that achieve user-specified objectives and constraints. <br />5. Implement CMake cross-platform build system into this combined application (Tasks 2-4) and document the build process on the Redmine web site. <br />6. Develop and test a stand-alone command-line interface to the model code described in Tasks 2-4 on multiple OS and hardware platforms. <br />7. Work directly with the scientists and staff at the FisL to develop a cross-platform graphical interface for the model code described in Task 6, to achieve a research-useable version of the software that displays and analyzes the data associated with each stage of the program operation and the results of the optimization. <br />8. Work with FiSL scientists and staff to document the code integration and operation of the command-line and graphical software products.<br />Performance Requirements<br />Perf Stand # Required Services Performance Standards Acceptable Quality Level <br />(AQL) Monitoring Method<br />PS-1 Contractor staff successfully execute PWS services Contractor personnel have:<br />&bull; Intimate knowledge of fire behavior modeling components used at the FiSL (FlamMap, FireFamilyPlus), databases and SQL queries, geographic information system toolkits (GDAL), and spatial map displays.<br />&bull; Expertise using these libraries and code to develop computer models that are used by wildland fire managers.<br />&bull; Expert knowledge of C++, Python, and cross-platform software development tools. <br />&bull; Knowledge of function of spatial data required for fire behavior modeling. No deviation. COR/Designee review of resume(s) and random observations of personnel abilities.<br />PS-2 Documentation of processes as required in the tasks Documentation is thorough, clear, accurate and free of errors, and completed on-time. <br />No deviation. COR/Designee review of documentation.<br />PS-3 Development and integration of modules and software Final products are completed on-time and are ready for integration without rework. No deviation 100% COR/Designee review/inspection.<br />Contract Incentives/Disincentives<br /><br />Disincentives: <br />1. If performance does not meet the required performance standards, more frequent reporting is required, as directed by the COR, without the Contractor billing additional hourly costs to the Government. <br />2. Rework required for unsatisfactory performance or deliverables (including typos, coding errors, etc) shall be done at no expense to the Government.</p>
<p><br />Deliverables: <br />Deliverable Due Date<br />Monthly Status Report (Task 1) Within five business days of the last day of the preceding month<br />Completion of the FIG module (Task 2) Two Months After Task Order Award (ATOA)<br />Adaptation of IA module (Task 3) Four Months ATOA<br />Combine Neural Net, IA, and FIG modules (Task 4) Seven Months ATOA<br />Documented Build Process on the Redmine Web Site (Task 5) 12 Months ATOA<br />Completion of GUI and Optimization Software (Task 6) Nine Months ATOA<br />Completion of Documentation (Task 7) 12 Months ATOA</p>
<p>Government Furnished Resources: <br />1. The work must be completed at the Fire Sciences Laboratory to ensure that the Forest Service scientists and staff have direct interaction in the development process. The Forest Service shall provide a computer, software, and network connection, occasional working space in a Forest Service laboratory, and any non typical office supplies that may be required for completion of the work. <br />2. Forest Service shall provide contractor identification cards and keys as necessary for access to government offices, research facilities and field study sites -if required by the assigned tasks.<br />3. The Forest Service shall provide all field and analytical equipment, if required by the assigned tasks.<br />4. IT Training Requirements: Contractor is required to successfully complete the USDA Computer Security Awareness Training and the USDA Privacy Basics training. The Forest Service will provide any access to training course(s) requirements such as the use of Government computer-Security Training and any other Safety or Security requirements required for the use of Government Property, Services, and Equipment prior to use.</p>
<p>Dependency Factors: All existing code will be provided by the individual scientists and staff of the FiSL.<br /><br />Place of Performance and Travel: <br />1. Onsite work at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory is required. The Forest Service will not reimburse overtime costs. <br />2. Travel is not expected for this task. In the event that travel is needed, the Contracting Officer must approve such travel prior to booking and commencement of travel. The Contractor shall be reimbursed for actual allowable and reasonable travel costs incurred during performance of this effort in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation.<br />3. Work requested under this task order is not intended to improperly supplement the Forest Service staff and not intended to be used as a "personal services." Further, the unit will assure that a "personal services" relationship will not be allowed to develop between using agency officials and contractor employees during the performance of any work under this task order. (Reference FAR section 37.104 regarding prohibited "personal services.")</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Vanishing Point Marine, LTD for the construction and delivery of a four element hydrophone array for use during marine mammal assessment surveys for the National Marine Fisheries Service Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC). The unit must work effectively with the existing sound equipment and follow a similar design to the current oil-filled two-element array to facilitate deployment, towing, and recovery with existing equipment. The array requires acoustic elements appropriate for the detection of marine mammal sounds at frequencies of less than 40 kHz to target the sounds produced by sperm whales and dolphins. The array must be delivered to Pascagoula, MS no later than May 15, 2012. This array is for a project studying sperm whale habitat use in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and will be used during a research cruise departing on June 5, 2012. The May 15, 2012 delivery is required to allow adequate time for equipment set-up and testing prior to the cruise's departure. The array is a critical element of the cruise because it will provide an improved ability to detect and track sperm whales in the survey area.
<p>A sources sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps on March 20, 2012 and closed on March 30, 2012. No responses were received.</p>
<p><br />Background<br />The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) requires routine surveys to assess the abundance of marine mammals in waters of the U.S. EEZ. Surveys are conducted using large vessels in oceanic waters to document the presence of marine mammals and collect data to develop abundance estimates. Typically, visual line transect surveys have been conducted to support these assessments. However, visual surveys have recognized limitations namely that they cannot detect animals below the water's surface, they cannot be conducted at night, and they are often limited by poor weather conditions. As a result, the SEFSC has been working along with other partners to develop the capability to use passive acoustic tools to detect marine mammal vocalizations and use these data to augment visual surveys.</p>
<p>The primary tool for this approach is towed hydrophone arrays. A hydrophone array consists of a cable with (typically) two or more hydrophones that are configured to be towed behind an oceanographic research vessel. The selected hydrophones in the array are chosen to target specific frequency ranges for the sounds made by target species of marine mammals.</p>
<p>The SEFSC has employed several hydrophone arrays for use in surveying marine mammals. The most commonly used unit is an oil-filled two-element array that employs Benthos AQ4 hydrophones. Data from this hydrophone array are processed and collected through a number of pre-amps and customized boards. The array and the associated sound processing equipment have been very successful for detecting the sounds made by sperm whales along with dolphins at frequencies up to 40 kHz.</p>
<p>Requirements and Specifications<br />The required hydrophone array must be appropriate for the collection of marine mammal vocalizations during large vessel surveys. It will consist of four hydrophone elements housed in oil-filled tubing and the associated cables needed to tow the unit at a distance of approximately 400m behind the vessel. In addition, the array will incorporate depth sensors to allow the operator to measure the water depth at which the array is operating. Finally, the array must be robust enough for deployment from a oceanographic research vessel (~200 feet length) and towing at speeds up to 10 knots.</p>
<p>Specifications include:<br />Cable required for a 400 meter towed array<br />4x Benthos AQ4 Hydrophone Elements<br />1x Depth sensor integrated into array<br />1x 40m Deck lead with break out box to 2x stereo channels<br />1x 5m Deck lead with a break out box to 2x stereo channels<br />1x Stereo amplifier appropriate for integrating with the AQ4 hydrophones<br />1x4mA depth reader unit to integrate into data collection software via USB cable</p>
<p>The four AQ4 mid-frequency hydrophone elements are integrated with matching HP02 29 dB preamplifiers incorporating a high pass filter set at 100Hz. The elements (AQ4s) have a flat frequency response to 15kHz and have a near flat working range to 30kHz. The stereo amplifier (HP27ST Balanced Amplifier) and conditioner unit provide an additional gain of 10-50 dB and high pass filtering between 0 and 3 kHz.</p>
<p>The depth sensor is based on Keller PA-9SE-50 20bar 4-20mA pressure sensor. The depth sensor is a 4-20mA device controlling the current between 4mA at 0 bar to 20mA at 20bar (200m approx). A 47 Ohm resistor provides a voltage differential in the line which is sensed by a Measurement Computing USB 1208LS DAQ which can be read using a depth sensor module in passive acoustic monitoring software (e.g., PAMGUARD).</p>
<p>The sensors are housed within a 5m long, 30mm OD polyurethane tube filled with inert oil. Components are mounted on 2mm strain bearing chords within a netting sheath. The tail end cap incorporates a bleed-screw which can be used for filling and topping up the oil if required. The unit is terminated with a rope tail to maintain towing stability. The tow cable is a 400m length, 14mm diameter with a Kevlar braid giving a 500 Kg breaking strain. Kellem's Grips are used to provide towing points. The inboard end of the tow cable terminates in a 19 pin gold plated CEEP connector.</p>
<p>Sole Source<br />Vanishing Point Acoustic LTD is the only commercial source with demonstrated experience constructing the small scientific hydrophone arrays used in marine mammal surveys by SEFSC. SEFSC previously purchased a small two-element array from this company over a decade ago and has had good success with that unit. Amplifiers, sound cards, and other deck-side processing equipment currently in use by SEFSC were designed to be used with this type of array. Another vendor could not develop the capability to produce an array of this type without additional costs for research and development and additional risk to the government that the unit would not perform as required. In this case, taking untested equipment into the field poses two significant risks. First, if the unit is not designed correctly, then it will not be able to withstand the hydrodynamic drag while towed and survey speed and may therefore be destroyed or lost. Second, if the unit does not perform as required and is unable to collect the required high-quality acoustic data, then the survey will not be successful resulting in considerable opportunity loss. Vanishing Point, LTD has demonstrated past performance producing oil-filled arrays that have been used effectively by SEFSC towed behind both large and small research vessels for over a decade. The developed system has performed exceptionally well and is integrated with existing sound processing equipment to provide high quality acoustic data.</p>

This J&A is also available at https://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/opportunities.jsp
In accordance with FAR 6.305, FAR 5.406, FAR 8.405, and FAR 13.501, this special notice publishes the Justification and Approvals for Other than Full and Open Competition. This is not a request for competitive proposals, bids, or quotes. The Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please email Contract Specialist, Christie VandenDries, at christie_vandendries@nps.gov with responses or questions regarding this requirement.
BACKGROUND:  Denali National Park is currently finalizing a Vehicle Management Plan and Environmental Impact Statement that will propose to move from a discrete seasonal limit on motor vehicle use level (currently 10,512 vehicles from late May to mid-September) to an adaptive management approach incorporating indicators and standards. The indicators will be monitored to ensure compliance with their associated standards, and 5 of the standards are directly related to vehicle numbers, traffic volumes or traffic patterns: numbers of vehicles at wildlife stops, numbers of vehicles at rest stops, numbers of vehicles visible in certain viewsheds at one time, the occurrence of gaps in traffic at critical sheep crossing locations,  and night-time traffic levels. The best way to monitor these indicators is by knowing the real-time location of most vehicles on the road at any given time. New satellite-based GPS technologies for real-time vehicle tracking have been developed that allow users to monitor traffic conditions via the internet. 
In 2010 we researched the market for companies offering this technology, we received quotes from three companies and selected Fleet Management Solutions as they offered the best pricing and all of the services required.  They were the only company to offer the texting ability needed to identify the wildlife stops.  As a result we purchased 7 GPS modems, texting units, associated hardware and service contracts to implement a field test of the units on the park road.  This field test was successful and we are now ready to purchase GPS modems, texting units, associated hardware and service contracts to outfit both the DENA vehicle fleet and the concessioner bus fleet.  If we were to purchase these supplies and services from a different company, we would have to do another field test to ensure that the different equipment would function properly under the conditions of the park road, costing additional time and money.
1) FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  .In 2010 we assessed the market for GPS fleet tracking systems that would meet our needs.  Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) was the only company we were able to indentify that would meet all of our needs.  As a result of this research, we purchased a total of 7 units and associated service contracts from FMS to do a field test on the equipment, which was completed in 2011 with positive results.  If we were to change suppliers at this time, we would need to repeat the field test of the units prior to full build-out to ensure that different units would work under the conditions of the park road, which would be costly in both time and money.  
2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs Requirements for a Real Time GPS tracking and fleet management system for buses and NPS fleet in Denali National Park:
"	System exclusively uses satellite network for relaying positional data from vehicle (no cellular service)"	System has fleet management capabilities in addition to location tracking"	Creates records of vehicle stops at pre-determined locations (rest stops ,etc)"	Message display interface that can link data to positional data to specific messages regarding wildlife stops"	Engineers willing to work to specify system to our needs (wildlife stop data and number of vehicles at any random wildlife location along the park road)"	One monthly access fee covers unlimited number of positions from vehicle"	Vehicle diagnostic features available (OBD II port for cars, J1939 for buses)"	Access for multiple users to software (with layers of security clearance)
Specifically, we require GPS modems and associated hardware for every vehicle that regularly travels the park road with the capability of establishing geofences to mark boundaries for most of the indicators (rest areas, pre-determined viewsheds and sheep migration corridors).  Texting units and associated hardware for concessioner buses that will allow drivers to record the location of wildlife stops (another indicator we are monitoring).  Service contracts for satellite time for each unit, texting service fees, additional set-up and the option for seasonal service suspension as the park road closes at mile 3 during the winter.  We also need data serving capabilities to assess compliance with the standards and report results to the public. 
3) A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):  
Fleet Management Solutions is the only company to offer all of the services we require.  Other companies offering fleet tracking abilities are either based on cell tower technology, or do not offer the two-way texting service or do not offer the data management capabilities.
In addition, as we have already purchased and field-tested units from this company and developed data handling protocols based on their interface, it would be costly and inefficient to purchase from a different provider as the field test would need to be re-run and new data handling protocols would need to be developed. 
4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  In 2010 we assessed the market for GPS fleet tracking systems that would meet our needs.  Most companies offering fleet management and tracking services use cell tower technologies for location reporting (as opposed to satellite) and this is not feasible at DENA as there is not cell tower coverage along most of the park road.  We were able to identify 4 companies that did offer the satellite service, and of those, only one, Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), also offered the integrated texting unit and texting service needed to locate wildlife stops, and the data management assistance needed to summarize information regarding the indicators we will be monitoring with the system.  As a result of this research, we purchased a total of 7 units and associated service contracts from FMS to do a field test on the equipment, which was completed in 2011 with positive results.
5) All actions have been taken to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

<DESC>****FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY****<br>The requirment is to procure, install and test the second 3000 KW backup generator and uninterruptable power supply (UPS) in conjunction with the backup generator, UPS and paralleling switchgear included in the current contract. These generators and UPS's will provide backup power for the water-cooled supercomputers which will be housed in the new building completed under MILCON contract W912QR-10-C-0037. The supercomputers are owned by the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP ) and the Air Force. <br><br>Two large 3000 KW generators working together through paralleling switchgear is a highly complex system prone to problems during the initial installation and testing. The supercomputers that the generator will backup are very high value DoD assets that must be protected in the event of a power outage. Without backup power for continued cooling and operation, the DoD will lose research and data, and the supercomputers will suffer very significant damage within minutes of a power failure. Initiating another procurement action to procure and test the operation of the UPS, two generators and paralleling switchgear working together as a system would increase risk to the Government. Paralleling switchgear, installed under the current contract, is necessary for the synchronization of multiple generators, working together, to provide backup power. The paralleling switchgear cannot be tested with the single generator that is currently installed. The second generator must be installed in order to properly test and synchronize the paralleling switchgear and ensure that the two generators are working together properly. <br><br>The supercomputer cannot be operated without backup power due to the risk of damage to the equipment if there is a power failure. Any delay in operating the supercomputer foregoes the opportunity for the scientific computation conducted in support of military operations and operations support.<br><br>Authority Cited: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 and DFARS 206.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br><br>Pursuant to FAR 15.201, The Walla Walla District, US Army Corps of Engineers is issuing this Request for Information.  This is notice is a market research tool used to determine the availability of knowledge of potentially qualified sources and their business size relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 237990, Heavy Construction to repair Coffer Cell #4 at Ice Harbor Lock & Dam.  Responses to this announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition planning decisions.  Depending on the responses received, a future solicitation with either be set aside for small business concerns and/or be issued on an unrestricted basis.  For purposes of this RFI, a firm is considered to be a small business concern if its average annual receipts for the past three years do not exceed $33.5 million.<br><br>The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but desires information on capability, technology, risk, price, innovative construction methodologies and other information to be used in assessing construction alternatives in the repair of Coffer Cell #4 at Ice Harbor Lock & Dam located near the navigation lock channel on the Snake River.  No award will be made from this RFI.  Additionally, no solicitation or specifications are available at this time.  Potential offerors having the skills, equipment and capabilities necessary to perform the work describe below are invited to provide feedback.  This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for information solicited.  Respondents to this notice will not be notified of the results of the Request for Information.<br><br>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br>The purpose of the potential project is to: Replace rock fill with a 6" minus gradation in a sheet pile cell approximately 40 ft in diameter.  Currently, river velocities have caused a significant amount of rock material to be lost at the bottom of the cell through existing voids between the sheet piles and the river bottom.  In addition to filling in the voided part of the cell, the government may also require large boulder size rock to be placed along the base of the cell where the voids exists.<br><br>Factors which will play a significant role in the construction of this work are: The cells are approximately 300 to 350 feet from the north shore at the downstream end of the Ice Harbor navigation lock.  Placement of the cell fill material may be by any means that does not allow voids or arching of the material in the cell, or material to fall outside the cell into the river.  Large boulders must be placed, not dropped into place.  The boulders will be along the upstream face of the cells.  It is anticipated that barges will not be able to set spuds or anchors due to environmental and regulatory restrictions.  Therefore other means to hold a barge in place will be required.  Powerlines are approximately 85 feet above the water surface.  The depth of the cells from the normal water surface is approximately 30 feet.  River flows exiting Ice Harbor Dam is currently 101kcfs, through the end of May could be as high as 150kcfs.<br><br>Attached to this notice are For Information Only (FIO) drawings and photographs.<br><br>CAPABILITY STATEMENT:<br><br>The Government requests that interested and capable firms respond to this RFI by providing a capability statement.  The capability statement is not expected to be a proposal; rather a short statement regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing or developed expertise and experience in relation to the Project Description.  Any applicable brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted along with the Capabilities Statement.  Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Walla Walla District USACE in tailoring this requirement consistent with industry capabilities.  <br><br>Include in your Capabilities Statement:<br>1.  Given the parameters and constraints listed in the Project Description, indicate how your firm would approach the work.  Include any special equipment (including any need for in-water anchoring points and their respective location); approximate construction duration and materials source.  <br> <br>2.  Provide a listing of projects that have been completed by your firm which are of the same or similar nature to the Project Description.  Please include information regarding:<br>a.  Your firm's role in the project-Prime or Sub-Contractor-as well as the percentage of the work your firm completed;<br>b.  Completion Date and/or construction window;<br>c.  Total Contract Value;<br>d.  Any types of special equipment or methodologies employed;<br>e.  Name, phone number and email address of customer/client<br><br>3.  DUNS Number and CAGE Code.  <br>4.  Indicate any small business certifications (HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Woman-Owned, 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business).<br><br>5.  Indicate bonding capacity.  A letter from your surety is not required.<br><br>Please respond to this notice via email to Elaine Vandiver at Elaine.M.Vandiver@usace.army.mil by 4:00PM on Monday, April 30, 2012.

A part of each course requires guest lecturers to facilitate discussions on the topics of complex gang prosecutions, debriefing gang members in a manner to maximize the amount of information gleaned, as well as increase the chances of recruiting persons of interest as informants and sources of information. It should be noted that this course, as an advanced course, requires information not easily available to or quickly absorbed by a regular field agent. The information necessary for this course is of a nature that it requires years of street level investigations and police work dealing in gang enforcement investigations, enforcement operations and prosecutions. Lectures needed are required to take an experienced field agent to a higher proficiency level of expertise and understanding in the area of street gang investigations.</p>

<DESC><br />THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. FAR PART 13, SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES, ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT. THIS ANNOUCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.<br /><br />This solicitation is a request for quotation.  The solicitation document incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-56.<br /><br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541511- Custom Computer Programming Services. This requirement will be competed under Full and Open Competition.  The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed-price purchase order to the offeror that offers the best value to the Government using the Lowest-Priced, Technically Acceptable method.  Please see the evaluation factors for award for a description of the minimum requirements that must be met in order for an offer to be considered technically acceptable.
<p><br />Operational faults for mechanical systems in office buildings can negatively impact energy consumption, maintenance costs, thermal comfort for the occupants and environmental protection.  Automated commissioning software programs are effective tools for the evaluation of mechanical systems in buildings.  These software programs are designed to aid building operators and commissioning agents to perform semi-automated commissioning tasks.  The software can be used to inject test signals to elicit system responses under different conditions and then to apply expert rules for analysis while requiring only rudimentary information on the hardware and operating setpoints for the systems involved.<br /><br />In previous years, the Mechanical Systems and Controls Group of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed CITE-AHU.exe, and the BACnet Communications DLL (BCD), to facilitate the analysis and maintenance of air handling units in office buildings.  The CITE-AHU software was developed in partnership with a French research lab (Centre Scientifique et Technique du B&acirc;timent, CSTB), while the BCD was developed solely at NIST.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is for the contractor to provide NIST with an updated version of the CITE-AHU application with a graphical user interface that provides all the functionality of the current Version 1.6.  The new version shall be referred to as Version 2.0.  For a full description of the requirements, please see the attached Statement of Work.</p>
<p>All quotations shall be submitted electronically so that they are received at keith.bubar@nist.gov no later than April 27, 2012 at 12:00 PM Eastern Time.

<DESC><p>DESC: The U. S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries intends to procure services for a new one-time data collection of demographic, economic and social information about the Gulf of Mexico grouper and tilefish fishery under the individual fishing quota (IFQ) program for the upcoming five-year review of the program. According to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act as amended through January 12, 2007 (MSA) (16 U.S.C. 1853a et seq.), IFQ programs fall under the umbrella of the Limited Access Privilege Programs (LAPPs). The proposed data collection is necessary to satisfy a MSA requirement. The population of interest consists of 766 individuals who were the initial recipients of IFQ shares when the program started in 2010 as well as any new shareholders and non-shareholders who purchased allocation. We anticipate a final population of approximately 1,000 individuals. The proposed methodology calls for surveying a representative sample of these individuals through in-person interviews. The sampling procedure will follow current procedures for economic reporting through the Logbook Program, namely a random 20% weighted stratified sample based on effort, primary gear and primary region of landing. The SEFSC anticipates the need to collect at least 100 voluntary, in-person interviews of past and present shareholders and allocation lessees for an overall response rate of 50%. A 47% response rate was achieved for a similar data collection used to conduct the five-year review of the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery under its IFQ program. Note that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) only allows 9 interviews for pre-testing purposes. Pre-tested surveys will not count towards the survey quota. Contractors will only use SEFSC-approved survey instruments for this data collection. Appendix A shows a version of the proposed survey instrument that was implemented for a similar data collection for the Gulf of Mexico red snapper commercial fishery. The attached survey form is presented for illustrative purposes only. It is meant to assist bidders when pricing their data collection services.<br />This is a total small business set-aside. The Solicitation is available and can be uploaded from this website. Interested firms may also request a copy of the solicitation via email to the Sharon Walker at Sharon.walker@noaa.gov or by fax to 816-274-6983, referencing this announcement number. This service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Far Part 12 Commercial Items. The Eastern Region, Acquisition Management Division (ERAD), requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). NO award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505. The Government also encourages all contractors submit their Certification and Representation thru the on-line Business Partner Network (BPN). The BPN is the single source for vendor data for the federal government. Contractors should go on-line at www.bpn.gov. NAICS code is 541990.</p>

Walls are three inches thick, filled with insulation and sided with metal on interior and exterior surfaces.  There are no windows.  Double doors with deadbolt are at one end of the structure.  The building is unheated, but has power which runs a dehumidifier and light.  A fire extinguisher is inside.C.Russian Bishop's HouseThis 1843 National Historic Landmark building is squared log construction, two stories tall, with a metal roof, and 7,800 square feet of space.  The first floor holds exhibits of Russian American objects in exhibit cases.  The second floor is restored to its original use as a furnished home and Russian Orthodox chapel. Furnishings include original icons and furniture.  The second floor Russian Orthodox chapel is used several times each year by the local Orthodox congregation.  The Russian Bishop's House is about  mile from the city fire hall and city police.  Sitka fire department officials have keys in lock boxes to the building.  Security at the building includes motion and heat sensor detection.  Video surveillance is planned, but not yet purchased. Fire protection includes air analyzer, smoke detection, heat detection, dry pipe suppression, manual pulls and fire extinguishers.    4.OBJECTIVESThis work consists of conducting a museum fire and security survey of the SITK facilities described above which hold or exhibit museum collections.  There are three primary purposes for conducting this work.A.The first is to reveal and identify weaknesses in existing security and fire protection systems, equipment, procedures, policies, and operations that could result in the loss of such museum resources as collections (artifacts, specimens, archives), collection records and documentation, and exhibits, as well as museum structures.B.The second purpose is to identify how to correct any weakness or deficiencies that may be found.C.The ultimate goal of the survey and of implementing recommended corrective action is the protection of museum assets and historical structure against all forms of losses including those due to theft, natural disasters, structural fire or fire fighting activities.5.TASKSThe contractor shall accomplish the above objectives by performing the following tasks:A.Conduct a site visit.B.Assess SITK fire prevention and security procedures and equipment in facilities housing museum collections, as they relate to preservation of museum resources and the structures housing them.C.Document findings and weaknesses, and make specific recommendations for correction of deficiencies in a written report.6.DESCRIPTION OF TASKSA.TASK 1 -- Conduct Site VisitThe Contractor shall at Contractor's expense purchase airline tickets, lodging, meals, rental car, and gasoline for rental car, airport parking, and any other incidental expenditure in order to travel to and visit the park.  All on-site work is expected to take three days minimum.B.TASK 2 -- Assess SITK fire prevention and security procedures and equipment in facilities housing museum collections, as they relate to preservation of museum resources and the structures housing them. 
The Contractor shall apply professional knowledge of fire prevention, detection, suppression and security issues while accomplishing the following:1.Prior to identifying himself/herself to all park staff, and as an ordinary visitor to the site, tour the exhibit and collection storage spaces and observe conditions and activities affecting protection of the museum collections and structures.  The Contractor will be accompanied by a park staff member at all restricted locations.2.Meet with management and staff including law enforcement rangers, maintenance staff, interpretive ranger and museum curator.  Other staff will be interviewed as deemed appropriate.3.Evaluate the physical security of buildings in both public and non-public areas.  Note problems with perimeters, including doors, windows, air intakes, roof hatches, and other penetrations.  Evaluate the ease with which someone could penetrate the perimeter with or without being detected.  The evaluation will result in specific recommendations within the final report covering areas of needed security improvement that do not conflict with life safety code.4.Review fire and security systems in terms of application of devices, system status based upon available maintenance and testing records, monitoring services, coordination with responding agencies, and Park Service response planning.  Recommendations will be included in the Contractor's final report.  Every effort will be made to initially recommend systems for the surveyed facilities that can be used "as is" or with slight modifications if upgrades or expansions are warranted in the future.5.Evaluate security staffing and procedures for all related functions, on a 24 hour basis.6.Evaluate park security training or security awareness programs for both security and non-security personnel.7.Evaluate policies for, and staff compliance with access and parcel controls in use at the site, particularly in office and work areas, in exhibit areas, and in collection storage.  Review existing emergency/disaster plans.8.Evaluate security policies and procedures, delegations of authority, and memoranda of agreement or understanding with local police and emergency areas.9.Evaluate key control and retrieval.  Evaluate adequacy of locking systems, key documentations, and key security.10.Evaluate internal and personnel security programs, particularly procedures to account for objects taken outside of collection storage and exhibit areas, such as in offices and work rooms or in transit.11. Evaluate security of objects on exhibit and in storage, including case design, security hardware, detection systems, locks, keying, accountability procedures and other internal control procedures and systems.  In particular, evaluate the ease with which objects may be stolen from exhibits without immediate detection of the act.  Evaluate the ease with which objects on exhibit may be vandalized, with or without immediate detection, taking into consideration any plans or proposals for new exhibits.12.Evaluate the timeliness, effectiveness, and accuracy of how the site reports criminal or other incidents involving collections.13.Observe and comment on other security problems that may be noted during the survey.14.Evaluate fire prevention policies, programs, and procedures in each building in both public and non-public areas.  Examine existing polices and the extent to which they are appropriate for the resources being protected and actually are being followed.  Examine the effectiveness of programs and procedures in preventing fires from starting.  National Park Service (NPS) Director's Order 58 Reference Manual: Structural Fire Management (RM 58) shall be the minimum standard for measuring quality.15.Provide an overview of fire protection and evacuation readiness in relationship to protection of museum assets and to enhance life safety.  National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes and NPS policy serve as primary references.16.Evaluate the number, size, types and locations of fire extinguishers currently in use in the surveyed facilities.  Determine if maintenance and testing is properly documented.17.Evaluate adequacy of staff training and ability in the prevention, detection, and suppression of fire.18.Evaluate fire suppression policies and procedures, including standard operating procedures, delegations of authority, and memoranda of understanding with local fire and emergency agencies for fire inspection or suppression services.  Memoranda must comply with RM 58 and with applicable federal regulations.19.Evaluate pre-fire planning and the extent to which such planning is in accordance with RM 58.  In particular, examine whether pre-fire planning takes into account the special needs of museum objects, records, exhibits, historical furnishings, historical structures, storage areas, and work spaces.20.Determine quality of the structural fire inspection problems that may be noted during the survey.  Evaluate park policies and documentation for all fire prevention, detection, and suppression procedures not otherwise specified above.21.Recommend system improvements as appropriate.  Specify options and advantages of one option over another.  Evaluate the relationship between fire and intrusion systems at the monitoring station and the park's ability to determine and archive alarm events, zones of activation, device status.22.On completion of on-site visit, a briefing shall be presented to superintendent, law enforcement rangers, maintenance staff, museum curator and chief of resources and interpretive ranger to discuss findings and corrective recommendations.  Contractor has an ethical obligation to verbally point out serious protection weaknesses as they are encountered, if such weaknesses could, in his/her judgment, result in imminent loss of park resources and/or life safety issues and concerns.C.TASK 3--- Document findings and weaknesses, and make specific recommendations for correction of deficiencies in a written report.

This project will eliminate central steam at Naval Support Activity (NSA) Norfolk and Lafayette River Annex (LRA).  NSA, which includes the Camp Allen area, currently receives steam from Naval Station Norfolk's P1 power plant. LRA is sourced from two steam boilers located in Building H.  High efficiency and high performance heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC) will be installed to replace the central steam systems in these areas.
 These systems may include ground source heat pumps, natural gas (NG) steam boilers, infrared heaters, NG condensing hot water (HW)boilers, NG condensing domestic HW boilers, Turbocor retrofit on chillers, variable flow chillers, variable frequency drives (VAV) on chill water (CW) pump and HW/CW temperature reset by outside air. The specific types of systems to be used will be determined during the design process. The project will include electric metering, sub-metering (at lighting panels, power panels, and HVAC loads), building envelop upgrades, occupancy sensors, economizer, cool roof, chiller heat recovery and outside and exhaust air system with variable speed heat recovery. The project will include tests and balancing and fundamental and enhanced commissioning of the new system, Direct Digital Controls (DDC) and digital lighting management.
  In addition, the project will demolish NH35.  In its place, a new control building at NSA's main site to house the new DDC center and public works personnel. The DDC infrastructure and main control room equipment are included as part of this project. Other building features include administrative areas, shops areas, and an area for the new DDC system.

<p>Statement of Work</p>
<p><br />Statement of Work and Project Description<br />"Radiation and Combined Injury Effects on Bone"<br />AFR/USU Project RAB3AO Collaboration w/IUSM</p>
<p><br />The Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), a tri-service biomedical research laboratory chartered in 1961 and a major component of the Uniformed Services University (USU), conducts research in the field of radiobiology and related matters essential to the operational and medical support of the U.S. Department of Defense and the military services. AFRRI collaborates with other governmental facilities, academic institutions, and civilian laboratories in the United States and other countries. Its findings have broad military and civilian applications.</p>
<p>In pursuit of the research goals and objectives of AFR/USU research project RAB3AO, a biomedical investigation will be undertaken to more clearly understand the severity of accelerated bone loss due to radiation and/or wound injury, as well as those molecular events involved. These experiments will occur during FY2012 and 2013 and involve the following tasks to be completed by Dr. Matthew R. Allen at the Indiana University School of Medicine, Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology (IUSM):</p>
<p>1. Micro Computed Tomography Scans of Distal Femur Samples:<br />Bone mineral density (BMD), geometry, and microarchitecture of the distal femur metaphysis (cortical and cancellous bone) will be assessed using a Skyscan 1172 high-resolution desk-top micro-computed tomography (MicroCT) system house at Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology. Bones will be removed from 70% ethanol filled vials and wrapped in parafilm to prevent drying during the scanning. Scans are obtained using an x-ray source set at 60kV and 167 &#61549;A over an angular range of 180 degrees (rotational steps of 0.40 degrees) with a 6 &micro;m pixel size. Calibrations using a density phantom standard will be performed to allow BMD assessment. Projection images will be reconstructed using standard Skyscan software. The trabecular bone compartment is segmented from the cortical shell beginning ~0.5 mm below the most distal portion of the growth plate and continuing for 1 mm. Images are binarized (threshold of 100-255) and the following parameters will be assessed at the distal femur for the three-dimensional volume: bone volume (BV), total volume (TV), trabecular bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), structure modeling index (SMI), trabecular pattern factor (Tb.Pf), connectivity density (Conn.D), and tissue mineral density. Cortical parameters that will be assessed just proximal to the distal femur include the following: cortical area (Ct.Ar), cortical thickness (Ct.Th), cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI), and tissue mineral density.</p>
<p>Upon completion of uCT scans, tissue samples will be used for three-point bending tests.</p>
<p>2. Femur Samples Three-Point Bending:<br />Mechanical testing of bone (to best define bone "quality") will be conducted at IUSM in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and will include 3-point bending of mid-shaft femur, yielding valuable data on structural properties (ultimate load, stiffness) as well as material properties (ultimate stress, elastic modulus) of cortical bone. These are important parameters defining bone's primary functions: coupling with skeletal muscle for efficient locomotion (stiffness, modulus) as well as resistance to fracture (ultimate load, ultimate stress).</p>
<p>Specifically, femurs are placed on a round steel pin (3mm) lower supports and loaded through a third pin that contacts the upper side of the specimen midway between the lower supports. Load is applied through a standard test machine (Instron 3345) at quasi-static displacement rate of 2.5 mm/min (0.1 in/min) until complete fracture of the specimen. Force is recorded via a load cell (Instron 220lb), with displacements measured by an LVDT (linear variable differential transformer) and data recorded at 10Hz. Load vs. displacement data are plotted to determine structural (or extrinsic) properties: stiffness (N/mm; slope of the linear portion of the load-displacement curve), yield load (N; value of the load at the yield point, which is the upper extent of the linear portion of the curve), ultimate load (N; maximum value of the load for the whole test), energy absorbed (mJ; area under the load-displacement curve). Tissue-level behavior is estimated through material (or intrinsic) properties, which are derived from extrinsic properties using classical beam theory analysis. The cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) obtained from uCT analysis is needed for these calculations. Typical parameters include: elastic modulus (GPa; material stiffness); yield stress (MPa; stress at yield load); ultimate stress MPa; stress at ultimate load); toughness (MPa; area under the stress-strain curve).</p>
<p>Upon completion of these mechanical testing analyses, tissue samples will be properly discarded at IUSM, as no further analyses are possible.</p>
<p>3. Embedding, Sectioning, and Staining of Femur Samples for Histomorphometry:<br />After harvesting femur samples from mice at AFRRI, the tissue is fixed in formalin for 48 hours, and then placed in 70% ethanol. At this point, femur samples will be shipped to Dr. Allen at Indiana University School of Medicine for embedding, sectioning, and staining for histomorphometry analyses at AFRRI. At IUSM, after samples are dehydrated in graded ethanols and then xylene, the bone is embedded in methyl methacrylate (MMA). Serial frontal sections (4-8 microns) will be cut using a motorized rotary microtome and affixed to slides. Two slides will be created for each sample, with 2-3 sections on each slide. (1) The 4 um sections will be stained using a von Kossa staining procedure with tetrachrome counterstain; and (2) The 8-um sections left unstained for fluorochrome label measurements. After a 4um and 8um slide is created for each sample, the slides and embedding tissue will be sent back to Dr. Swift at AFRRI for histomorphometry analyses.</p>
<p>Analysis of MicroCT and 3-Point Bending Data:<br />Data from uCT scans and 3-point bending analysis (mechanical testing) will be submitted to AFRRI in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in either raw form or averaged for each variable by experimental group. Dr. Allen's lab is not responsible for statistical analyses of data. All statistics on data compiled at IUSM by Dr. Allen's lab will be completed at AFRRI. Dr. Allen will assist Dr. Swift with the interpretation of data, as it pertains to the overall scope of the project. Furthermore, Dr. Allen will provide his expertise in the field of bone biology for the preparation of any manuscripts and will be a co-author on all data that is presented from these experiments (abstract, manuscript, or presentation form).</p>
<p>To complete this experiment, we will employ the following analyses: (1) micro computed tomography scans of distal femora, (2) mechanical testing of femur mid-shaft (3-point bending of femora), (3) histomorphometry analysis of static and dynamic measures of distal femora, and (4) analysis of serum for biomarkers of bone metabolism</p>

See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.<br><br>The Government intends to award a minimum of three contracts, two to large businesses and one to a small business, for Geotechnical Engineering Services. The awards will be selected from responses to this announcement. The contract performance period for each contract will be five (5) calendar years from date of award (Task Order periods of performance can exceed the contract period of performance). Each total contract amount will be NTE $5,000,000 and if the capacity is exhausted before the five (5) year time frame the contract will be considered complete. The minimum guarantee will be $25,000 per contract. The primary purpose of these proposed contracts is to provide geotechnical engineering services within the geographical boundaries of the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division to include USACE-Nashville, primarily at the Wolf Creek and Center Hill Dams rehabilitation projects. Other district offices within LRD are authorized to use this contract with approval of the USACE-Nashville District Chief of Contracting.<br><br>Task orders will be issued on a negotiated firm fixed-price basis. The minimum order shall not be below $2,500 and the maximum order shall not be greater than $2,000,000. If remaining capacity falls below $2,500 the Government will consider the contract complete. The contracting officer will consider the following factors in deciding which contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: performance and quality of deliverables, available contract capacity, uniquely specialized experience, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and any other project relevant factors.  Contractor may be required to perform a site visit prior to preparation of proposal for any given task order.  The Government will specify in the request for proposal if a site visit is recommended. Profit will be proposed, evaluated, and negotiated per task order.<br><br>The Federal Supply Code (FSC) is C211, and the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541330.  The small business size standard for this procurement is $14,000,000. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  The subcontracting goals for the Nashville District are Small Business 29%, Small Disadvantaged 9%, Woman Owned 5%, HubZone 6%, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned 3%.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(6) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award. The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(7) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a <br />Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an MLCA 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the<br />specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>(8) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>(9) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR</p>
<p>Invoices shall be submitted to the USCG Finance Center http://www.fincen.uscg.mil/electron_cg.htm and via email to Dorothy.rawls@uscg.mil .</p>

<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary.

Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>
<p>a.The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Past Performance<br />2. Price</p>
<p>Past Performance is weighted approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.</p>
<p>Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical and past performance proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p><br />b. Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1, Past Performance: This factor evaluates recent past performance on relevant work similar to the scope of work in this solicitation. Recent past performance is considered to be within the last three (3) years. In evaluating past performance, the Government will consider the information in the Offeror's proposal as well as information gathered from other sources including former customers, Government agencies, federal databases and other references.</p>
<p>Factor 2, Price: The total evaluated price of the offeror will be determined by totaling the proposed prices of all the CLINs. An assessment of the reasonableness of proposed prices shall be made. Techniques and procedures described under FAR 15.404-1(b) and as supplemented will be the primary means of assessing proposal reasonableness. Evaluation techniques described under FAR 15.404-1(c) may also be performed in further determining the reasonableness and affordability of the proposal.</p>
<p>c. FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (July 1990), is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>d. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) [ ] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) [ ] Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<DESC><p>COMMERCIAL ITEM COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement, and its attachments, constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. SF18 has been generated merely to provide applicable information in a coherent format and is not, in and of itself, a written solicitation. This is a simplified acquisition under Part 13 issued in the open market for a brand name or equal solution. Provision 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal is applicable.</p>
<p>This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-56, effective April 2, 2012. This solicitation is reserved for small business concerns with the NAICS code 334220 and a small business size standard of 750 employees, per http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards.</p>
<p>The following are included in an attachment to this synopsis/solicitation HSSS01-12-Q-0088: (1) A list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities, and units of measure; (2) A description of requirements for the items to be acquired; (3) The date and place of delivery and acceptance and FOB point; and (4) Additional terms and conditions, if any.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, does not apply to this acquisition. Instructions to Offerors are contained in the RFQ SF18.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, is not applicable to this acquisition. Items are being procured per 13.106 and will be evaluated in accordance with 13.106-2. Award will be based on a best value/trade off evaluation, price and other factors considered, in order to award a firm-fixed price order to the Offeror presenting, in the judgment of the Government, the most advantageous offer to the Government. Best value evaluation is, in and of itself, a subjective assessment by the Government of the proposed solutions in order to acquire the most advantageous result for the Government, price and other factors considered. Subjectivity is inherent in the process. It is noted that the requirements for negotiated procurements contained in FAR Part 15 are not applicable; for example, the Government is not obliged to follow formal evaluation procedures, to establish a competitive range, or to engage in discussions with contractors. Evaluation will be made on four factors: Technical Capability, i.e. conformity with technical specifications and warranty requirements; ability to meet Delivery terms; Past Performance; and, Overall Price. The Government will query relevant FAPIIS/PPIRS/CPARS information to assess past performance. Past performance questionnaires will not be distributed, and Offerors are not required to submit past performance information. If relevant, recent past performance is not publicly available, the Government will evaluate this factor neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>Offerors are not required to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with their offers but must provide DUNS and be registered in Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA).</p>
<p>The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with any additional FAR clauses cited in that clause.</p>
<p>Agency clause USSS 3052.204-90 is applicable: "In accordance with 18 U.S.C. 709, any contractor, except with the written permission of the Director of the U.S. Secret Service, who knowingly uses the words "Secret Service", "Secret Service Uniformed Division", "U.S.S.S.", "U.D." or any colorable imitation or such words or initials, in connection with or as a part of any advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet or other publication, play, motion picture, broadcast, telecast, other production, product or item, in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such advertisement, circular, book, pamphlet or other publication, product, or item, is approved, endorsed, or authorized by or by associated in any manner with, the U.S. Secret Service or the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division shall be punishable as follows: a corporation, partnership, business trust, association, or other business entity, by a fine under this title; an officer or member thereof participating or knowingly acquiescing in such violation or any individual violating this section, by a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both."</p>

If not possible, the secondary goal is to have at least half the aggregate delivered by May 8, 2012 and the remaining half delivered as soon as possible.
There are two delivery locations.  The first location shall receive delivery first and shall receive half of the aggregate purchased (approx. 900 tons).  The location is +35.18624 latitude, -114.57994 longitude.  Putting these coordinates into a mapping program such as Google Maps will yield the exact location of the drop.
The second delivery location shall receive the remaining half of the aggregate.  The coordinates for this location are latitude +35.175597, longitude -114.592971.<BR><BR>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

There will be two (2), two- day workshops, one taking place in Nashville, TN August 2-3, 2012 and the other in Los Angeles, CA August 9-10, 2012.

52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer who provides the best-value solution to the Government. Evaluation will be based upon a best value tradeoff analysis, considering the following factors:

Technical
Past Performance
Price

    In determining best-value, all non-price factors are significantly more important than the price factor.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

* Quotes are due Friday, April 27, 2012 at 12:00pm EST.

<DESC>This synopsis and notice is posted after evaluation of results from the sources sought synopsis of 1 Aug 2011 which outlined an Air Force requirement for fabrication of miscellaneous sheet metal brackets to support F-16 aircraft hardware kits. Based on market information from that evaluation and other sources, it is the Air Force's intent to set-aside this requirement 100% for participation of small businesses located in a HUB Zone who will compete on the basis outlined below for a Multiple Award Contract (MAC) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) opportunity. Firms who meet this set-aside standard with an operating location certified to be in an identified HUB Zone may submit offers. With the evaluation of offers, the Contracting Officer, at his/her sole discretion, reserves the right to establish a competitive range whereby offerors may be excluded from further competition. This could occur with technical or other findings that within the judgment of the Contracting Officer make the offer un-awardable without extensive revisions, impacting the award schedule to an extent that precludes accommodating the proposal re-write within a reasonable time frame. Past performance information and responsiveness and responsibility of the offeror could inform and influence this decision. Offerors will be given opportunity to respond to adverse past performance information. <br /><br />Applying technical, past performance and cost/price evaluation standards, the Air Force also intends to limit the number of Offers for which a full evaluation will be completed so that no more than four (4) contracts will be awarded. If adequate price competition is not manifest, the contracting officer may require additional cost information to the extent necessary to determine that price(s) are fair and reasonable. The Air Force reserves the right to award a single contract or no contract at all. Offers will be evaluated to a technical standard on a pass/fail basis; relevant past performance will be evaluated in accordance with the instructions to offerors and evaluation criteria in Sections L and M, respectively, of the Request for Proposal (RFP). <br /><br />Cost/price for the first configuration identified will also be evaluated in accordance this RFP, which is an initial bona fide quantity of brackets of a single configuration. These will be "build to print" based on level three (3) or four (4) drawings provided. This initial requirement is referred to hereinafter as the "sample". A single award, funding this sample, will be made to a successful offeror on an initial order at the outset and in conjunction with the basic contract. This order will include a first unit to be submitted for test qualification to the office and ship-to/mark-for address specified in the order and a production quantity subject to test qualification. Funding for a post-award teleconference will also be included. Other successful multiple contract awardees will receive an order funding the post-award teleconference only. These actions will constitute fulfillment of the minimum order guarantee under the FAR clause at 52.216-19 (meeting the requirements of FAR 16.503(c)). <br /><br />Evaluation of the technical proposal, pricing for the initial configuration test and production sample line item, the responsiveness of the offeror to the other terms and conditions of the RFP (including the set-aside requirements) and review of the responsibility and past performance of the offeror will constitute the balance of the initial evaluation. Subject to these limitations, submittals that pass this evaluative hurdle will entitle the respective offeror to an award of an ID/IQ contract under the multiple award approach. This is considered to be a Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection methodology to include a review of past performance. No "trade-offs" or "trade-space" will be applied as part of a best value award decision. <br /><br />Technical proposals will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. The Air Force reserves the right to evaluate pricing for the test and production sample line item and reject offers that are not considered reasonable, based on previous history for similar sample or production articles. No other trade-offs or trade-space versus price is being considered for this baseline evaluation. The Air Force will reserve the right to conduct discussions. <br /><br />Fair opportunity and competitive consideration in accordance with FAR Part 16 will be provided for all awardees for subsequent or future orders for additional brackets based on the initial or a distinct set of specifications to be provided and as requirements are identified by the Air Force within the scope and ordering period established by the basic multiple award contracts. <br /><br />The array of sheet metal brackets, panels, and parts that will be defined and specified during the life of these contracts will range from 1" x 1" x 1" to 3" x 3" x 3". Items can consist of a broad range of bends and shapes, with some requiring hardware installation (DIE, nuts, nut plates, etc...). The range of materials includes but is not limited to various aluminum, steel, and corrosion resistant alloys. Along with the usual cutting, deburring, forming, other processes such as welding, heat treat, age harden, hardness test, anodize, epoxy prime, paint, passivate, install hardware, insert heat shrink, and marking with UID will be required. Quantities could range from 1 to 5000. Work will otherwise be performed in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) attached to the model contract. <br /><br />The government intends to award these basic contracts with five (5) year ordering periods. The solicitation is 100% set aside for certified HUB Zone firms. The official solicitation FA8232-12-R-3007 will be posted on or about 01 May 2012, no less than 15 days subsequent to the date of this synopsis and bidding will close no less than 30 days after that. All responsible HUB Zone firms may submit a proposal which will be evaluated competitively using the LPTA methodology described.

This synopsis precedes the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) entitled, "Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC)" for construction and design/build services.  The subsequent contracts will be performed for the Department of Veterans Affairs, James E. Van Zandt, Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC), Altoona, Pennsylvania.    As a result of the solicitation, the Government intends that a minimum of eight (8) indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, (IDIQ) Task Order Contracts will be awarded providing sufficient qualified contractors present acceptable offers. This is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set aside.   Contractors must be registered in the US Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Biz Database to be eligible to submit a proposal.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/. Contractors must be verified as a SDVOSB to be eligible for award.  Contractor must be registered in Central Contractor Registration at www.ccr.gov to be eligible for award.  Additionally, contractors must be registered with Vets 100 at http://vets.dol.gov/vets100/ and complete their online Representations and Certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The applicable NAICS code is 236220 with a size standard of $33.5 million in average annual receipts.   Awards will be made to offerors whose proposals are responsive and conforming to the RFP, and are also determined to be most advantageous to the Government in terms of Technical, Past Performance, and Price. Work to be performed under the MATOC contract(s) will include construction and design/build projects.  Typical work includes, but is not limited to: interior and exterior renovations and alterations, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, heating and air-conditioning, HVAC controls, fire suppression, and intrusion alarms, communications, limited utilities, site-work, landscaping, fencing, masonry, roofing, concrete, asphalt, paving, storm drainage, limited environmental remediation, construction of new facilities, demolition, surveys, design/build and other related work.  Projects will principally be design/bid/build type from already completed designs, or projects specified by a statement of work using the VA Master Specifications.  However, offerings may include some design/build projects.  Award of the design/build option may be restricted to companies having demonstrated past performance and technical capability for performing design/build projects. Contractors can qualify for a base contract without submitting a proposal for design/build.  The resulting contracts will not have fixed unit costs.  All contract work will be completed through individual task orders awarded for individual projects at the James E. Van Zandt VAMC.  Each task order will be priced individually and will include its own wage determination.  These task orders will be competed amongst the IDIQ awardees only.  Each of the resulting contracts will include a one (1) year base period and four (4), one (1) year option periods. The minimum and maximum values for a single Task Order are $2,000 and $5 Million, respectively. The maximum value of each contract will not exceed $30 million over the life of the contract. The minimum guaranteed order for each contract is one (1) task order valued at a minimum of $5,000 or if no task order project is awarded a guaranteed fee of $5,000 will be paid to the contractor. The minimum fee will only be paid if the awarded contractor continues to compete for, but is not awarded, a task order throughout the life of the contract. If a contractor is not awarded all option years as a result of a contractor failing to submit proposals or as a result of poor past performance on previous task orders, the contractor will not be entitled to the minimum guarantee.   The Government reserves the right to issue additional solicitations and award construction contracts within the activities covered by the proposed MATOC contracts to contractors other than those awarded a contract under this solicitation. This is not a solicitation for a Requirements Contract.  The anticipated release date for the Solicitation is April 10, 2012.  The solicitation will be posted at this website, www.fbo.gov. All inquiries shall be in writing, e-mail inquiries to Mr. Michael Koontz at michael.koontz2@va.gov.

<p>The Office of Acquisitions and Grants Management (OAGM) in support of CPI is seeking information regarding a requirement for FBI Channeler and Non-channeler services to conduct fingerprint based background checks described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW)/ Performance Work Statement (PWS). The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from industry regarding this potential requirement and to obtain feedback from industry in response to requirements described in the Draft Statement of Work (Draft SOW/PWS) transmitted with this notice. <br />More information about the FBI Channeler requirements can be obtained at the link provided below: <br />http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/background-checks/fbi-approved-channelers<br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for <br />information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, at this time, CMS is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future procurement is conducted. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<br /><br />2.0 Background<br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is pursuing an aggressive National Fraud Prevention Program (NFPP) focused on prevention and detection that is integrated, risk-based, and measurable. The CMS Center for Program Integrity (CPI) created in April 2010 is accountable for strengthening existing program integrity activities for the prevention and detection of fraud, waste, and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and Children's Health Insurance Program. <br />The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-149), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-152) (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act or ACA) makes a number of changes to the Medicare program that enhance provider and supplier enrollment process to improve the integrity of the program to reduce fraud, waste and abuse. CMS implemented certain provisions of ACA to establish additional screening requirements for providers and suppliers. The CMS Rule (72 FR 5862) published February 2, 2011 (http://federalregister.gov/a/2011-1686) implemented at 42 CFR &sect;424.518(c)(2)(B) requires certain owners of providers and suppliers designated to the high level of screening undergo fingerprint-based criminal background check. Based on the current definitions, fingerprint-based screening will impact the initial enrollments of providers/suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics/Orthotics &amp; Supplies (DMEPOS) and home health agencies (HHA), and providers/suppliers coming back into the Medicare fee-for-service program from a moratoria status.<br /><br />2.1 Purpose and Objectives <br />CPI is anticipates obtaining services under a single contract to manage collection of fingerprint records on a nationwide basis, to submit fingerprints and receive criminal history record information (CHRI) furnished by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and to review the CHRI for violations of Medicare provider and supplier enrollment requirements and policy that might support CMS's denial or revocation of provider/supplier enrollment. The contractor must be able to handle approximately 50,000 fingerprint-based checks annually. <br />The FBI limits exchange of criminal history records through approved channelers (contractors) who are granted access to FBI record systems. This CMS acquisition includes two functions. <br />&bull; A channeler function to collect and submit fingerprints and receive criminal history record information (CHRI) furnished by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and <br />&bull; A non-channeler function to securely receive and store CHRI to meet CMS recordkeeping requirements, to review and interpret CHRI reports and assign a pass/fail recommendation based on CMS enrollment regulations and guidance.</p>
<p>Both functions are subject to FBI's outsourcing standards and security policy for handling CHRI data and as described in the attached Draft Statement of Work. Contractors intending to provide channeler services must be approved by the FBI to channel fingerprint data to the FBI and obtain CHRI for an authorized recipient (CMS) and authorized purpose. <br />Contractors without this approval or without teaming arrangements with entities that have this approval will not qualify for award.<br />More specific data on the requirement is provided in the draft SOW as an attachment.</p>
<p>2.2 Delivery Period:<br />Services to be provided will be required for either a 4 or 5 year period from date of contract award. Estimated timeframe for contract award is December 2012 to February 2013.<br /><br />2.3 Limitations:<br />Currently, there are no limitations associated with this effort; however, as a result of continued market research the government reserves the right to set aside either a portion or all of this effort for small business.<br /><br />2.4 Security Requirements:<br />As stated earlier both functions (channeler and non-channeler) are subject to FBI's outsourcing standards and security policy for handling CHRI data and as described in the attached Draft Statement of Work. <br /><br />2.5 Project Business/Technical/Performance Requirements</p>
<p>Please refer to the attached Draft Statement of Work and additional reference documents which are provided for industry comment and feedback. <br /><br />3.0 Requested Information:<br />Interested vendors are requested to provide an RFI response that includes comments on the Draft Statement of Work and focuses on the questions provided below. The information gained from this RFI will be used for CMS internal use and consideration: <br />1. What challenges do you see in meeting the CMS requirement to deliver nationwide coverage for fingerprint collection? What are the standard industry methods for collecting fingerprints on a nationwide scale? What customer support methods are standard for this type of effort to help individuals locate the nearest fingerprint location, e.g. website, 1-800 call center, help desk? <br />2. Is it feasible to require that individuals pay for their fingerprint collection, and that CMS only reimburse the contractor for the CHRI and fitness recommendation as described in the Draft SOW requirement? <br />3. Do you see any challenges with meeting the CMS requirement to collect the identity of the individual being fingerprinted (Name, DOB, SSN, Address) and to electronically, secure, retain and pass this identity information to CMS? <br />4. Do you see any challenge with the CMS requirement to hold fingerprints for up to 365 days before transmitting to FBI? <br />5. Based on guidance from FBI CJIS, CMS understands that the Channeler is required to pass the CHRI through the Authorized Recipient (CMS) before it is accessed and stored by a Non Channeler. How is this FBI requirement generally met? What is the most efficient manner to pass the CHRI from the Channeler to CMS and the Non Channeler? What recommendations would you make to improve the requirement described in Section 5.3 of the Draft SOW? <br />6. Do all CHRI output files require manual review to make a fitness recommendation? Can automated methods be used (for instance, to report when no criminal record is found for an individual)? What circumstances impact whether manual review versus automated review is possible when making a fitness recommendation? <br />7. How long does it take to make a fitness recommendation when the CHRI has final dispositions on an individual's criminal record? <br />8. How long does it take to search for final disposition information that is not found on the CHRI? What sources do you use to fill in missing disposition information? What are the average costs or level of effort associated with each case worked under this task?<br />9. What is the standard industry practice for communicating an unfavorable finding in the CHRI? Do you send a written communication on behalf of the Authorized Recipient to the individual with information about the findings?<br />10. Upon reviewing the attached Draft SOW, what are the main variables/factors considered when making a determination to bid or not to bid (i.e., CLIN structure, contract type, contract length, subcontracting goals, socio-economic programs, incentives, period of performance, contract historical data). What should the Government consider: <br />a. To enhance competition?<br />b. To increase Small Business participation?<br />c. To reduce costs?<br />d. To acquire the appropriate skill mix?<br />e. To maximize understanding and to clarify tasking?<br />f. What recommendations should be considered to ensure the objectives and outcomes are clearly identified?<br />g. To maximize the use&nbsp;of&nbsp;Firm Fixed Price?<br />11. What percentages of the various small business socio-economic categories (e.g., Veteran Owned, 8-a, Hubzone, etc.) are achievable in specific tasking areas and/or overall? What tasking would small business be most able to perform?<br />12. If you are currently providing these services to any Government agencies could you please provide the contract number and contact information for the Contracting Officer Representative?<br /><br />4.0 Responses<br />4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper. White papers shall be submitted in Microsoft Word compatible, Times New Roman 12 font, and are due no later than 30 April 2012, 3:00pm EST.

The size standards for each NAICs and PSC code to be qualified as a small business can be located on the following site <br />http://www.sba.gov/contractingopportunities/officials/size/index.html<br />A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, averaging no more than $14 million dollars in annual receipts. <br />To qualify, annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for 3 or more complete fiscal years means the annual average gross revenue of the concern taken for the last 3 fiscal years. Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for less than 3 complete fiscal years means its total receipts for the period it has been in business, divided by the number of weeks including fractions of a week that it has been in business, and multiplied by 52. Respondees are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only. Additional standards and conditions apply. Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 19 for additional detailed information on Small Business Size Standards.

This CMS acquisition includes two functions. <br />&bull; A channeler function to collect and submit fingerprints and receive criminal history record information (CHRI) furnished by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and <br />&bull; A non-channeler function to securely receive and store CHRI to meet CMS recordkeeping requirements, to review and interpret CHRI reports and assign a pass/fail recommendation based on CMS enrollment regulations and guidance.</p>
<p>Both functions are subject to FBI's outsourcing standards and security policy for handling CHRI data and as described in the attached Draft Statement of Work. Contractors intending to provide channeler services must be approved by the FBI to channel fingerprint data to the FBI and obtain CHRI for an authorized recipient (CMS) and authorized purpose. <br />Contractors without this approval or without teaming arrangements with entities that have this approval will not qualify for award.<br />More specific data on the requirement is provided in the draft SOW as an attachment.</p>
<p>2.2 Delivery Period:<br />Services to be provided will be required for either a 4 or 5 year period from date of contract award. Estimated timeframe for contract award is December 2012 to February 2013.<br /><br />2.3 Limitations:<br />Currently, there are no limitations associated with this effort; however, as a result of continued market research the government reserves the right to set aside either a portion or all of this effort for small business.<br /><br />2.4 Security Requirements:<br />As stated earlier both functions (channeler and non-channeler) are subject to FBI's outsourcing standards and security policy for handling CHRI data and as described in the attached Draft Statement of Work. <br /><br />2.5 Project Business/Technical/Performance Requirements</p>
<p>Please refer to the attached Draft Statement of Work and additional reference documents which are provided for industry comment and feedback. <br /><br />3.0 Requested Information:<br />Interested vendors are requested to provide an RFI response that includes comments on the Draft Statement of Work and focuses on the questions provided below. The information gained from this RFI will be used for CMS internal use and consideration: <br />1. What challenges do you see in meeting the CMS requirement to deliver nationwide coverage for fingerprint collection? What are the standard industry methods for collecting fingerprints on a nationwide scale? What customer support methods are standard for this type of effort to help individuals locate the nearest fingerprint location, e.g. website, 1-800 call center, help desk? <br />2. Is it feasible to require that individuals pay for their fingerprint collection, and that CMS only reimburse the contractor for the CHRI and fitness recommendation as described in the Draft SOW requirement? <br />3. Do you see any challenges with meeting the CMS requirement to collect the identity of the individual being fingerprinted (Name, DOB, SSN, Address) and to electronically, secure, retain and pass this identity information to CMS? <br />4. Do you see any challenge with the CMS requirement to hold fingerprints for up to 365 days before transmitting to FBI? <br />5. Based on guidance from FBI CJIS, CMS understands that the Channeler is required to pass the CHRI through the Authorized Recipient (CMS) before it is accessed and stored by a Non Channeler. How is this FBI requirement generally met? What is the most efficient manner to pass the CHRI from the Channeler to CMS and the Non Channeler? What recommendations would you make to improve the requirement described in Section 5.3 of the Draft SOW? <br />6. Do all CHRI output files require manual review to make a fitness recommendation? Can automated methods be used (for instance, to report when no criminal record is found for an individual)? What circumstances impact whether manual review versus automated review is possible when making a fitness recommendation? <br />7. How long does it take to make a fitness recommendation when the CHRI has final dispositions on an individual's criminal record? <br />8. How long does it take to search for final disposition information that is not found on the CHRI? What sources do you use to fill in missing disposition information? What are the average costs or level of effort associated with each case worked under this task?<br />9. What is the standard industry practice for communicating an unfavorable finding in the CHRI? Do you send a written communication on behalf of the Authorized Recipient to the individual with information about the findings?<br />10. Upon reviewing the attached Draft SOW, what are the main variables/factors considered when making a determination to bid or not to bid (i.e., CLIN structure, contract type, contract length, subcontracting goals, socio-economic programs, incentives, period of performance, contract historical data). What should the Government consider: <br />a. To enhance competition?<br />b. To increase Small Business participation?<br />c. To reduce costs?<br />d. To acquire the appropriate skill mix?<br />e. To maximize understanding and to clarify tasking?<br />f. What recommendations should be considered to ensure the objectives and outcomes are clearly identified?<br />g. To maximize the use of Firm Fixed Price contracting?<br />11. What percentages of the various small business socio-economic categories (e.g., Veteran Owned, 8-a, Hubzone, etc.) are achievable in specific tasking areas and/or overall? What tasking would small business be most able to perform?<br />12. If you are currently providing these services to any Government agencies could you please provide the contract number and contact information for the Contracting Officer Representative?<br /><br />4.0 Responses<br /><br />4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR ASH Program Support Services
This is a market survey for ASH Program Support Services.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing ASH Program Support Services.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541512 (Computer Systems Design Services), with a size standard of $25 Million.   
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR ASH Program Support Services
This is a market survey for ASH Program Support Services.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing ASH Program Support Services.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541512 (Computer Systems Design Services), with a size standard of $25 Million.   
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:	Type of services provided by your firm.	Size and type of services of a like or similar nature provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance).	Number of years in business	Evidence that your company has a CMM Rating (Capability Maturity Model) for software development, and if so, what your rating is.	Evidence your company has a Facility Security Clearance, and if so, the level.
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments.

<p>This is a pre-solicitation/synopsis notice in accordance with FAR 5.203(a) as well as a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP). The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) anticipates soliciting proposals to procure commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) Information Technology (IT) hardware and components under the Enterprise Strategic Hardware Operations Procurement (ESHOP).</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.215-3 - Requests for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997), the Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to this Draft RFP. Responses shall not include proprietary information and data will not be returned. Any responses that are marked proprietary will not be considered. The Government may utilize Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) and/or Support Contractors to provide technical advice on the responses. Otherwise, information submitted under this Draft RFP will be limited only to the ESHOP Program Management Office (PMO) and to the support contractors who have executed the requisite ESHOP non-disclosure agreements and conflict of interest statements. The Government may use the information provided to develop a comprehensive procurement strategy and solicitation. Any information used will be on a non-attribution basis. This Draft RFP does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>
<p>1. This requirement is a 100% small business set aside under NAICS Code: 334119 - Other Computer Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing with a size standard of 1,000 employees. All vendors must be registered as a small business under the above NAICS Code prior to award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.

<p>2. Questions about the Draft RFP shall be submitted in writing by Wednesday, April 11, 2012 at 3:30 PM Eastern Time to Adam Greenspan at (adam.m.greenspan@nga.mil). All questions (and subsequent answers) will be posted on the FBO website to provide equal access to information for all potential offerors.</p>
<p>3. The Government anticipates award of three (3) separate single-award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts; one for each of the three (3) IT equipment categories which include: User-Facing Equipment, Network-Transport Equipment, and Compute-Storage Equipment. (see Attachment 2.) Offerors are allowed to submit proposal(s) for one, two, or three categories of IT equipment. To be eligible for award, offeror proposals must include unit prices for EVERY item in a given hardware category, or hardware categories if the offeror is proposing more than one.</p>
<p>4. The Government anticipates award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the LOWEST PRICE DEEMED TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE to the Government. If two or more quotes are equal in all respects, the government will choose a winner in accordance with FAR Part 14.408-6.</p>
<p>5. This pre-solicitation/synopsis notice includes the following attachments:</p>
<p>Attachment 1. DRAFT Statement of Work, Enterprise Strategic Hardware Operations Procurement (ESHOP), 26 March 2012</p>

Do you note any equipment that is at end of service life?<br /><strong>d. Can you confirm that the salient characteristics provided for each item would allow your firm to propose products that are equivalent to the brand name item specified in the Draft NIHRL? If not, please recommend salient characteristics that would allow your firm to propose an equivalent item.<br />e. In cases where you judge that an "or equal" IT hardware item does not exist based on the salient characteristics provided in the Draft NIHRL, please provide the technical rationale that justifies only the brand name product for that particular item.<br /><br /></strong>B. Reference the Draft Statement of Work (SOW):</p>
<p>a. Are the requirements clear?<br />b. Are the delivery times realistic?<br />c. Other comments?</p>
<p>C. General comments about the ESHOP acquisition</p>
<p>6. All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (http://www.ccr.gov) database as well as ORCA (www.orca.gov) prior to any contract award. Lack of registration in CCR and ORCA will make an offeror ineligible for award. Please submit the following information with submission in response to this Draft RFP: Cage code and&nbsp;DUNS number.<br /><br />It is anticipated that this requirement will be competed solely through the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov). However, the anticipated official solicitation issuance date is unknown.

The GTRP provides resources in the areas of preclinical and clinical-grade vector production in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and in the conduct of pharmacology/toxicology studies. In addition, the GTRP provides funds and regulatory assistance to investigators wishing to conduct gene therapy clinical trials. The GTRP consists of a clinical coordinating center that oversees and coordinates the logistics of the core laboratories and provides regulatory assistance for clinical trials; a preclinical-grade vector production core laboratory; a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for adeno-associated virus (AAV); a clinical-grade vector production core laboratory for lentivirus; and a pharmacology/toxicology core laboratory. The PTCL will continue to 1) participate in the Steering Committee (SC), and subcommittees as necessary, and attend SC meetings and participate in teleconferences, 2) provide and maintain a Manual of Procedures (MOP), 3) develop, in collaboration with the SC, a customer satisfaction survey for investigators to evaluate the quality and acceptability of the product and timeliness of the service provided, 4) develop, in collaboration with the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), maintain and update a secure and password protected web site page and provide updates to the CCC as needed, 5) conduct preclinical vector toxicology testing and biodistribution studies using all types of gene therapy vectors in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) in small and/or large animals, and applicable Federal and State regulations, for use by NHLBI-funded investigators, 6) maintain an established facility to support rodent, non-human primate (NHP), and large animal pharmacology/toxicology and biodistribution studies 6) adhere to the treatment of animals in accordance with IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) guidelines, 7) monitor facilities to ensure quality control of pharmacology/toxicology studies and that a regulatory framework is established to ensure consistent data quality. Develop plans to facilitate rapid communication of adverse toxicological results to the CCC and NHLBI and maintain and make available for review, as necessary, records of monitoring activities, and 8) prepare materials for and participate in site visits to the contractor's facilities and ensure that up-to-date versions of all required certifications, inspections, and assurances are available for review during site visits.
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals (RFP) and, although one award is anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. A five-year "Cost-Reimbursement-Completion" type contract with a "Multi-year" FAR 17.1 funding mechanism, is being considered for this requirement. The ultimate contract type and funding mechanism will be determined by the NHLBI, based on what best fits the GTRP program goals and the available funding. The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://fedbizopps.gov. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. It is also offerors' responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any amendments to the RFP. Letters of intent to submit a proposal for the RFP are due no later than May 28, 2011.

The Charleston VA Medical Centers current interventional radiology procedures requires a broad stock of expendable supplies that are very costly to maintain, require labor intensive inventory and maintenance procedures and have in the past expired before use. Establishment of a consignment agreement with Cook Medical Inc., the current provider of these supplies, can provide the supplies without financial risk to RHJVAMC due to expiration and provide the flexibility to expand or collapse the program as demand dictates. 

 As it is impossible to determine the exact quantities that will be required during the agreement term, the negotiated agreement will result in a consignment agreement with an estimated usage of $70,000 for the base year plus four option years.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION

1.  Contracting Activity:  	Department of Veterans Affairs
Office of Acquisition Operations
Technology Acquisition Center
1701 Directors Blvd. Suite 600
Austin, TX 78744

2.  Description of Action:

     The proposed action is for a seven month firm fixed price (FFP) contract to    
     provide Data Center Escorts for the Department of Veterans Affairs National 
     Data Center Program (NDCP) staff.  The proposed vendor for this action is 
     Culpepper & Associates Security Services, Inc. (CASS).  

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:

The purpose of this is to provide security escorts with secret clearances to 
escort NDCP personnel during equipment  installation and system migration.  
The VA is consolidating VistA computer systems by region into Defense 
Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computer Centers 
(DECCS).  A secret clearance is required for unescorted access to DISA 
facilities.  NDCP personnel on this project do not have secret clearances, and 
require escorts until they obtain secret clearances.  DISA does not provide 
this support.  The security escort support is required in DISA DECCS in St. 
Louis, MO and  Warner-Robins, GA.  The estimated value of the contract is 
<REDACTED>.

4. Statutory Authority:

    The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this            
    acquisition is 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), Veterans First Contracting Program.  	
    Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by written 	
    justifications as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5,       
    "Authorized or required by statute".

5.  Reason for Authority Cited:

The proposed source for this action, CASS, is a certified SDVOSB that is technically qualified to provide security escort services for the VA in DISA facilities.  Their headquarters is located at 1810 Water Place, Suite 180 Atlanta, GA 3033.  Culpepper specializes in force protection services for government agencies, and has performed the required tasks in VA and DISA facilities.    
In 2010, the NDCP obtained leased commercial computer room space in Denver, CO and Reading, PA to host the Region two and Region three VistA computer systems.  VA was responsible for the space and only VA security requirements were needed for unescorted access.  In 2011, VA decided that DISA would host the VistA systems, and DISA requires a secret clearance for unescorted access in their facilities.  VA clearances and investigations would not be reciprocated, so new investigations have to be completed for VA personnel working in DISA facilities.   This decision has put constraints on the project schedule.  

CASS was selected as the source to provide the required security escort services based on its proven experience in meeting this
requirement, as well as its status as a SDVOSB.  CASS currently has contracts with VA and DISA, and currently has personnel on contract in the facilities where the support is required.  CASS personnel are familiar with both VA and DISA physical security Guidelines, and VA would not have to spend additional time and resources orienting personnel or working with a learning curve.  Due to time constraints CASS would also add value by starting immediately, which is enabled by their familiarity with the places of performance.  

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:

 Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  

7.  Actions to Increase Competition.
All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis to determine     any future acquisition strategy. Additionally, consistent with the guidelines of the Veterans First Contacting Program, the proposed action described herein will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities Page in accordance with FAR Part 5.
.   
8.	Market Research:

Market research was conducted by searching the VetBiz.gov database on February 16, 2012 to determine if CASS is a SDVOSB.  This search concluded that CASS is a registered and verified SDVOSB in the VetBiz.gov database, and qualifies as a SDVOSB in accordance with federal small business size standards for the applicable NAICS code 561210 "Facilities Support Services." A search was also conducted in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) on Feburary 16, 2012 which showed that CASS is registered  in the CCR as a SDVOSB.  Based on this market research, the Government's technical experts have determined that CASS is a SDVOSB that can meet all of the Government's' requirements
9.  Other Facts:

The Procuring Contracting Officer has determined that this procurement meets all the requirements of statute 38 U.S.C. 8127(b).  This procurement is below the $5,000,000.00 threshold; CASS has been determined to be a responsible SDVOSB; and a fair and reasonable price will offer the best value to the Government.

VBA Office of Compensation and Pension Services 
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


Upon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.

1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by Acquisition Service - Frederick, Frederick, MD, on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Office of Compensation and Pension Services. 

2.   Nature of Action Being Approved.

This activity proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award (sole source) with Associated Veterans LLC - Quality Solutions (a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business) for the procurement of the development and implementation of plans for the re-adjudication of claims in accordance with orders from Nehmer v. U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  Associated Veterans LLC - Quality Solutions is a registered and verified SDVOSB in VetBiz.gov. 

3.   Description of Service and Supplies.

The Compensation Service in the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is responsible for paying disability based compensation and pensions to Veterans and their survivors.  Core elements of that responsibility are determining the level of disability that the veteran has suffered and whether or not that disability is service connected.  The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 38, Part 4 (Schedule of Rating Disabilities) is critical in making determinations in a fair, equitable and consistent manner.  There is considerable interest within VA as in the need to refine and update these regulations.  These regulations continue to get significant scrutiny from Congress and others. The nature of the conflicts and the injuries sustained in these conflicts are different with each war.  Further, our understanding of injury, disease and healing processes change over time.  As a result the Rating Schedule and the parallel regulations for the adjudication of disability claims (38 CFR Part 3) must be constantly updated.  

This requirement provides on-site executive-level business support to the Director of Compensation Service (Comp. Serv.) and the Nehmer Re-adjudication program regarding all efforts to implement court orders for re-adjudication pursuant to Nehmer v. U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  The time frame for implementation is established in part by statute and in part by past court orders in Nehmer v. U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  The Agent Orange Act of 1991 requires the Secretary of VA to determine whether changes to the presumptive diseases are necessary within 60 days from the date the Institute of Medicine (IOM) publishes report on the health effects of exposure to herbicides in Vietnam.  The most recent report was published on September 29, 2011.  After those 60 days, VBA has 60 days to publish a proposed rule and then 90 additional days to publish a final rule.  As such, VA has a total of 210 days to establish final regulations.  
Once regulations are established, court orders in Nehmer require VA to identify previous claimants who may be members of a class action lawsuit, re-adjudicate their claims in accordance with court orders, and do so within the court's prescribed timeline.  Previous court orders for Nehmer have required VBA to begin re-adjudication of claims expeditiously and without delay.  As such, VBA must implement a plan for re-adjudication of 68,000 claims affected by the new regulation within 210 days.  Nehmer court's perspective on how the VA should approach the re-adjudication can be found in orders dated April 28, 2006 and June 19, 2007.  In those orders, the Nehmer court ordered VA to "act in good faith to use all resources at their disposal to perform the tasks [identified in the order] as quickly as possible."  Additionally, the Nehmer court indicated that VA "remains under court order to act with speed, diligence, and good faith," and notified the VA that "any actions to the contrary shall subject defendant to contempt proceedings and sanctions in accordance with the inherent authority of the Court."
The Contractor will have the following major and supplemental responsibilities:

Major Responsibility:  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in the statement of work (SOW), except as may otherwise be specified.  This requirement provides on-site executive-level business support for the implementation of policy that will develop, coordinate, and update the: 
Nehmer and other presumptive training guides Nehmer and other presumptive training guides (Current Nehmer training letter (TL-104) located at the following web address: http://vbaw.vba.va.gov/bl/21/publicat/Letters/TrngLtrs.htm
o	
o	Nehmer Readjudication training video
o	Training plan
o	Training sessions 
o	Decision notice and rating templates specific to Nehmer
o	Quality review process that complies with Nehmer court orders
o	Fast letters addressing re-adjudication pursuant to Nehmer
o	Databases and reports that VA will submit to court as documentation of re-adjudication pursuant to Nehmer court orders

Supplemental Responsibilities:

o	Prepare briefing material related to implementation of Nehmer presumptives (status reports, spreadsheets and other documents) 
o	Provide guidance for software development of  Nehmer adjudication and Nehmer retro-active payment systems
o	Develop recommended responses to Regional Office inquiries regarding implementation of Nehmer
o	Monitor Nehmer case files for proper inclusion in Nehmer class membership and quality of ratings 
o	Liaise with Office of General Counsel regarding Nehmer case reviews

The proposed contract cost is as follows: Base Year: $129,920.00; Option Year One: $199,752.00; Option Year Two: $204,745.80. The total cost is estimated to be $534,417.80. The total contract life cycle is thirty months. 
4. Identification of Statutory Authority.

The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR 6.302-5. The applicable statute is PL 109-461, Veterans First Contracting Program (codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127 and 8128).

5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.

Associated Veterans LLC - Quality Solutions is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business registered and verified in VetBiz.gov. Associated Veterans has significant experience within VBA providing project management services to six of the staff and business line offices in VBA.  They have also provided support for implementation of Nehmer court orders when, in 2009, the Secretary of VA added ischemic heart disease, Parkinson's and b-cell leukemias to the list of diseases presumptively connected to military service in the Republic of Vietnam.  Recently, the Secretary of VA added another disease.  The addition of this new disease will prompt Compensation Service to implement court orders by the federal district court in Nehmer.  Compensation Service will rely upon the subject matter expertise Associated Veterans developed during the 2009 re-adjudication to assist with the implementation of the court's orders.  

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential
sources as practicable.

A Notice of Intent to Sole Source will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunity System pursuant to the Federal Register Vol. 74, No. 234 (Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Acquisition Regulation Supporting Veteran-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses) Final Rule #5.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices.

No award shall be made until the Contracting Officer determines the price to the Government to be fair and reasonable. This determination will be based on a comparison of the offeror's price proposal to the Government IGCE which is based on an average of rates from GSA MOBIS Schedule 874-1 SDVOSBs in the Washington Metro Area. 

8.   Description of Market Survey.

The skills and experience required for this project are well defined and specialized. As mentioned in section five, Associated Veteran, LLC has the required personnel with the experience needed for the successful completion of this requirement.  However, market research was conducted to develop an Independent Government Cost Estimate.
9.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

PL109-461 Section 502 (c) states:

Sole Source Contracts for Contracts Above Simplified Acquisition Threshold:  For purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a Contracting Officer of the Department may award a contract to a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans using procedures other than competitive procedures if:

1)	Such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;
2)	The anticipated award price of the contract (including all options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in Section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403)) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and 
3)	In the estimation of the Contracting Officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.

As noted above, Associated Veterans, LLC has been determined to be a capable and verified SDVOSB.  Associated Veterans will be determined responsible prior to contract award, following (1) above and in accordance with FAR 9.104.  The award price is anticipated to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, but will not exceed $5,000,000 following (2) above.  The Contracting Officer anticipates contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers the best value to the Government, following (3) above.  As noted, award will not be made until the quoted price is determined to be fair and reasonable.

The VA Program Office has estimated the cost of a new contractor will be an additional $37,120 to $46,400 based on the hourly rates listed in the IGCE. Another eight to ten weeks of one full-time Government employee will spend up to 50% of his/her work time familiarizing a new contractor with the cases and processes. The additional time amounts to 160 to 200 total staff man hours spent.  Given that VA has a total of 210 days from September 29, 2011 to re-adjudicate 68,000 claims, a new contractor is not in the best interest of the Government, the VA, or the Veterans the VA serves. 


10.  Listing of Interested Sources.

Associated Veterans, LLC
10042 Cedar Spring Lane
Culpeper, VA 22701

11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.

It is anticipated that the requirement will not be needed once the base period and potential option periods have been exhausted.  However, should the Program Office need the requirements once all option periods have been exercised, market research will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 10.
