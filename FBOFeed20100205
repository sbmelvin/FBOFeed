<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center (JM&L CC) Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806 - 5000, on behalf of the, Munitions Engineering Technology Center, Medium and Cannon-Caliber Munitions Division, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, has a need for the development and demonstration of technologies that will bridge the gap between the current Counter Rocket Artillery and Mortar (C-RAM) capability and the future Objective Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) capability for providing mobile, 360 degree hemispherical extended area protection from RAM targets.  These technologies are to be demonstrated as part of ARDECs four-year Extended Area Protection and Survivability (EAPS) Integrated Demonstration (ID) Army Technology Objective (ATO) Program.  ARDEC's desire is to develop technologies that support a ground-mounted air-defense gun system to provide both wide-area protection and protection to specific high valued assets on the battlefield.  This program is to further advance a rudimentary fire control sensor tracking system that was successfully demonstrated to command-divert and command-detonate outgoing single 50mm interceptors during the previous Research phase of the EAPS ATO.The objective of EAPS ID ATO phase of this Program is to demonstrate a more mature and sophisticated Fire control sensor/Fire Control and Radio Frequency (RF) suite capable of providing command functions to optimized 50mm interceptor ammunition.  This sensor Suite must provide the following functions; a search mode capable of detecting RAM type targets in a single quadrant, tracking of multiple threats and 50mm interceptors simultaneously, and command communication functionality and a telemetry link to the outgoing interceptors.  This will require the development of the command functions to support the necessary communication data-link with the Fire Control Sensor to the outgoing interceptors as well as the Fire Control software algorithms using the fire control sensor data to implement objectives of the EAPS ATO-ID program.  ARDEC-Picatinny intends to satisfy this requirement by awarding a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type Contract for a period of performance of four (4) years (FY10-FY13) through full and open competition.  This contract would be incrementally funded each year.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available electronically at the following Internet address: http://procnet.pica.army.mil &  https://www.fbo.gov/  on or about 45 days from the date of this announcement.  Points of contact for this requirement are Gherin Fracasso, Contracts Specialist, gherin.fracasso@us.army.mil, and Mr. Timothy Jensen, Contracting Officer, tim.jensen@us.army.mil.  Proposals will be required on or before 12:00 pm EST 15 April 2010 to: JM&L CC, Attn: CCJM-JA, Gherin Fracasso, Bldg 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC)-Iowa City, is soliciting and intends to award a firm fixed price contract for Architecture/Engineering services, "A/E to Design B40 Wet Lab Center of Excellence" at the VAMC in Iowa City, IA. NAICS Code 541310, size standard $4.5 million. The scope of work for this project shall include but not be limited to the design services for the renovation of approximately 3,900 GSF on the basement level of Building 40.  The design will result in creation of wet laboratory space for relocation of research functions from 10th floor of Building 1.  Renovation of the space will include installation of ceiling tile, floor surfaces wall finishes, and extension of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing system to support laboratory functions. In addition, the project will develop new restrooms and renovate the elevator lobby.  This project will realign research space and will result in having research laboratories moved into the renovated space in Building 40, room B101, that are currently located on the 10th floor of the Medical Center, Building 1. Moving the 10th floor laboratories to Building 40 will allow all wet laboratory space to be located together enhancing collaborative research and moving researchers in closer proximity to shared core services. In addition, animal research is currently being done by the laboratories on the 10th floor. The process of transporting animals to the 10th floor involves covering the cages with an opaque cloth and transporting on the freight elevator in the Medical Center. Transporting these animals involves using shared patient care entrances. By moving the laboratories to the Building 40, room B101, no animals will ever be allowed in the Medical Center. Construction is currently underway for a new Animal Research Facility that is attached to Buildings 40 and 41 allowing for the investigators to not have to transport animals outside these buildings.  The firm selected will provide separate bid documents that include specifications and drawings for structural, architectural, mechanical and electrical work needed to provide for the wet laboratory function.  The services of a third party Fire Protection Engineer will be required.  Existing architectural, electrical and mechanical components will require evaluation for extension and/or size changes.  A/E contract will include design (with reviews), reproduction of bid documents, construction period services, final inspections and as-built drawings.Estimated construction cost range is between $500,000 to $1,000,000.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate, plans to issue a commercial item solicitation, evaluate offers using the Best Value procedures under Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (including oral presentations), and award a single contract for five multi-engine turbofan aircraft to support the U.S. Navy's Test and Evaluation (T&E) program (NAVSEA PEO IWS 1TE). The base contract period is for one year with four one-year option periods. This action will be a full-and-open competition and not set-aside under any small business program. The NAICS Code is 481219, Other Nonscheduled Air Transportation, and the small business size standard is $7.0M. The Navy requires five multi-engine turbofan aircraft for the conduct of ship T&E trials off the coasts of the United States (including the Hawaiian Islands, Alaska, and U.S. territories such as Guam, Puerto Rico, etc.) or the coasts of its allies (Japan, Canada, etc.).  The contractor is guaranteed payment of 500 flight hours per contract year. Additional flight hours will be paid as needed. As a minimum condition for award, the contractor shall provide the necessary management, labor, and equipment for operating five exclusive use multi-engine turbofan aircraft from its home facility.  However, the Government may consider it more beneficial if a contractor offers to position one long-range aircraft in the vicinity of Norfolk, Virginia and a second long-range aircraft in the vicinity of San Diego. At least three of the offered aircraft shall be capable of cruising for at least 6.0 hours, and two aircraft must be capable of cruising for at least 2.8 hours.  However, the Government may consider it more beneficial if all five offered aircraft are long-range models. Each aircraft shall have hard points for the attachment of government-furnished, electronic attack (EA)/electronic protection (EP) pods and/or internal capability for government-furnished T&E equipment and/or personnel. An electronic copy of the solicitation will be available for download at www.fedbizopps.gov by approximately February 19, 2010. An apparent successful offeror must be registered in CCR (www.ccr.gov) to be awarded a contract.

<DESC>N1241101004 - WILDLIFE EXCLUSION AND PRE- AND POST-CLOSURE BAT SURVEYS AT ABANDONED MINES IN CORONADO NATIONAL MEMORIAL, FORT BOWIE NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE, AND SAGUARO NATIONAL PARKNAICS 541620 - Small Business Size Standard $7.0 Million - This acquisition is set aside for SMALL BUSINESS.
Abandoned mine lands (AML) are typically defined as any physical feature previously used for the extraction of minerals for which no responsible party can presently be identified.  For purposes here, the most important of these are hardrock mining features that include shafts, adits, tunnels, and other associated openings that have been adaptively used as roosting sites of various types of bats.  
As the result of funding made available through the 2009 enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the National Park Service (NPS) is undertaking a series of AML closure projects aimed at improving human health and safety at AML sites servicewide.  In the Intermountain Region (IMR), as elsewhere in the NPS, mine hazards are being mitigated through mine closures, entrance/portal reconstruction, exclusionary gates, fences, and other measures.  Bat and other wildlife surveys were conducted as part of the Intermountain Region's planning process for developing closure recommendations.  The purpose of this acquisition is to conduct additional surveys prior to and following closure of the mine features.  
Information on Coronado National Memorial may be accessed at www.nps.gov/coro; information on Fort Bowie National Historical Site may be accessed at www.nps.gov/fobo; and information on Saguaro National Park may be accessed at www.nps.gov/sagu.  The solicitation and related documents will be available electronically at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  A paper solicitation will not be issued and electronic submission of contractor proposals will not be accepted.  This is a best value procurement and award will be made based on price and price related factors.  The Government will not accept an offer for award on the basis of superior capability without concern for the price of the offer.  Non-Price factors are significantly more important that cost or price.  Factors include, but may not be limited to: demonstrated abilities in work required (experience) and past performance.  Details related to the source selection process will be posted within the solicitation in Sections L & M.  Solicitation issue date is on or ABOUT Februrary 5th, 2010.   All questions regarding this announcement and future submission of the solicitation and related documents are to be directed in writing to the Contracting Officer, Tammy K. Gallegos via email at tammy_gallegos@nps.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) intends to award a sole source contract for the follow-on Government Furnished Equipoment (GFE) production modification of the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS), APG-65 Lot III Reliability Improvement Program Operational Test Program Set (OTPS), G81S00010-3.  NAWCAD is contemplating award to End To End, Inc., Portsmouth, VA as the only source that could supply the modified/upgraded OTPS in time to meet workload requirements. Without this essential repair equipment the F/A-18 will not be able to repair RADAR components that are required to perform the operational mission of the aircraft.  NAWCAD previously awarded a procurement to End to End to upgrade the GFE OTPS to improve the reliability and maintainability and to provide a technical data package representative of the newly designed OTPS.  However, no drawings or data were purchased for the corrections to the original design/configuration nor were any vendor modification instructions delivered that would allow another contractor to modify an existing unit.  End to End has modified 19 units under a previous contract and will be doing so to an additional 28 units under the proposed procurement.  As the orginal equipment manufacturer of the redesign, End to End is considered to be the only source that has the technical data necessary to perform this effort without a costly reverse engineering and/or further redesign.  The Government requires deliveries of the modified units to commence within 60 days after award at a rate of 4–6 units per month.  The authority for this sole source action is FAR 6.302-1: only one responsible source.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This is not a request for proposals; however, all responses to this notice must be received within 15 days.

<DESC>***THIS POSTING IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY***
The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Washington, Officer In Charge of Construction (OICC) Bethesda intends to award a firm fixed price sole source construction contract to Clark/Balfour Beatty (CBB) using other than full and open competition.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 ("only one responsible source") 
This action is for the design build services for an approximately 1204-space multipurpose parking structure located in the community services district of NNMC near the former building 23 site and to the east of the existing patient parking structure, building 55.
CBB is currently working BRAC Phase I.  Throughout the BRAC Phase I work, CBB has been required to coordinate design with the State Historic Preservation Office and NCPC.  This ongoing relationship and understanding of the unique design requirements associated with NNMC and the BRAC construction effort give CBB the ability to quickly gain acceptance from these agencies, further reducing schedule requirements.  Their Phase I work also included a patient parking garage within the designated "historic district".  Consistency of design for both garages is critical to receiving approval from NCPC in order to meet the aggressive schedule.  Having one designer to coordinate a holistic design will eliminate the inevitable discontinuity between two designers.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme, California, has the requirement for the effort to merge Assessment System for Hazard Surveys (ASHS) and Munitions Survivability Software (MSS) software capabilities into the Explosives Safety Siting (ESS) software module as well as to develop additional functionality not available in any of the software programs.  Specific tasks are identified in the Automated Explosives Safety Site Planning Requirements Document (ASPRD) and in Section 5 of this document.  The ESS software will be expanded to include expeditionary site planning tools provided in the ASHS and MSS software packages.  Additional graphical data layers that can easily be created by users and extensive graphical editing commands will be added to allow users to create or update maps to account for rapidly changing circumstances in the field.  Special tools will be added to allow the user to automate the siting of facilities represented by complex graphics.  For example, measured distances between an above-ground magazine may be different, depending on whether the facility being sited is a potential explosive site (PES), or an exposed site (ES).  Additional tools will be provided to allow quick and accurate siting of new facilities inside of existing development constraints and to account for reduced separation distances provided by barricade protection.
New geospatial tools will be developed to assist a user to compare and update maps as they change over time.  Tools will be provided to closely track changes to data so that configuration management is not lost when edits are made to copies of the 'official' map of record at any DoD installation.  Extensive wizard help commands and training aids will be developed to assist users to quickly become proficient with the use of the software and to recall how to execute software commands when the software hasn't been used for an extended period of time.
A standardized site approval submittal package format will be developed that will be the same for all Military Services.  Tools for identifying and mitigating rule violations will be developed to allow the user to override violations as justified by Engineering Analyses, Terrain analysis, Risk Analysis, Grandfather Clauses, or other rationale.
Prior to submitting a proposal please complete the Non-Disclosure statement (see attachment) and electronically submit to the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Phil Wager (e-mail phillip.wager@navy.mil) for a copy of the ESS Source Code.
An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Firm-Fixed-Price, single award contract will be awarded. The ordering period will be for a period of five (5) years. This procurement is being processed in accordance with FAR 15, contracting by Negotiations using a Request for Proposal. This requirement is a 100% Small Business set-aside. Offers from other than small business concerns will not be considered. 
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511. The Small Business Size Standard is $25 Mil. 
After proposals are evaluated, an award will be made with reasonable promptness to that responsible bidder to the Government, considering technical and the price-related factors included in the solicitation. 
When issued, the solicitation will be posted in the NAVFAC website at http: www.neco.navy.mil which uploads to http://www.fbo.gov (FedBizOpps). The websites are free and provide instructions for downloading the solicitation. 
Prospective bidders are responsible for downloading a copy of the solicitation from the NAVFAC website. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about 22 FEB 2010; the closing date will be 30 days after posting.   
The cutoff date for questions will be 12 MAR 2010.
In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all firms must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov prior to any award of a contract.  They, also, must be registered in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) http://orca.bpn.gov/.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.    The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 333999, and the FSC Code is 2510, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity, Panama City Receiving Officer, 101 Vernon Ave., Panama City, FL 32407.

Registration may be accomplished by accessing the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov/.

<DESC>This publication serves as a Notice of Intent for the US Environmental Protection Agency to acquire contractor services to provide on-site technical support to the Office of Research and Development, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL), Western Ecology Division (WED) in Corvallis and Newport, Oregon.  This is a small business set aside.  The applicable NAICS is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.
WED is a multi-disciplinary, ecological research laboratory that performs state-of-the-art research.  Our website http://www.epa.gov/wed/ provides an overview of WED and the types of research conducted on terrestrial, freshwater, and estuarine/marine ecosystems.  The successful contractor will provide technical support both on-site at WED facilities in Corvallis and Newport and (for short periods) at off-site and remote field sites (within the USA).  
The contractor shall:  perform chemical, physical, biological, biochemical, statistical, geographical, and other standardized analyses; collect, acquire, store, categorize, integrate, and synthesize data and information; collect, format, process, document and provide quality control of samples and informational information from the laboratory and field; prepare, maintain, and update technical records, logbooks, QA records, and databases for work performed; operate and adapt specialized sampling,  monitoring, analytical, and experimental equipment; provide statistical design and analysis support;
design, develop, and implement simulation and statistical models; conduct sophisticated scientific analyses; conduct literature searches and provide factual reports on current scientific knowledge and methods; compile, organize, and summarize existing environmental data and geographic coverages and evaluate their utility; prepare and document alternative scientific methods for obtaining and analyzing information and recommend methodology for EPA approval; prepare high quality, written, and oral, scientific and technical reports on research results and work performed including publishing findings in peer-reviewed scientific literature; provide technical editing, statistical, and graphical support in the form of tables and figures for research publications and oral or written presentations; provide technical support for technology transfer operations to EPA program offices, regions, and other appropriate parties; participate in national and international scientific meetings through presentation of technical papers; organization, and facilitation of special symposia; propose and implement quality assurance and quality control requirements.  
The Government anticipates a cost-plus-fixed-fee, level-of-effort-term-type contract with a 12-month base and four 12-month option periods for a total contract period of performance of 60 months.  The base term contract period of performance and each optional period of performance will consist of 10,800 hours.  The Base Term contract period and each subsequent Optional period will have quantity options within each term for up to 44,200 additional hours. This could result in a maximum potential of 275,000 hours.  
The anticipated contract effective date for this procurement is 01/01/2011.  This procurement represents a follow-on to contract EP-D-06-013.  The anticipated release date of the Request for Proposals (RFP) is on or about 3/19/10.  The EPA anticipates a pre-proposal conference to be held in Corvallis, Oregon, 7-10 days after release of the RFP.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 days later.  
DRAFT copies of the Statement of Work and Evaluation Criteria are posted to the Internet for information purposes at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  The RFP and any subsequent amendments will be available ONLY via the Internet World Wide Web at the website above.  No telephone or facsimile requests will be honored.

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Proposal is to support advanced development of domestically manufactured, next generation, portable, fully kitted (for operation “out of the box”) ventilators with a goal of FDA clearance or pre-market approval.  The ultimate purpose of the HHS/BARDA ventilator initiative is to procure (the amount and schedule to be determined under a separate procurement contract vehicle) advanced ventilators for the Strategic National Stockpile at a cost significantly lower than currently stocked ventilators.  The RFP also requests a design to unit cost estimate with a goal of <=$3000 per unit with tiered volume pricing as a consideration for award and further requires design to cost documentation prior to completion of the contract effort.  The ventilator development goal is to advance the technology to meet the operational and clinical needs during an all-hazards event (caused by chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear exposure, pandemic influenza, other biological outbreak, or natural disaster) and provide respiratory support for large numbers of severely ill patients.  The ventilator must have increased capability to meet operational and clinical needs for treatment of respiratory compromised patients during an all-hazards event in which mass casualties and shortage of experienced care providers may be expected. 

Notice:
The purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to enter into a contract to support advanced development of domestically manufactured, next generation, portable, fully kitted (for operation “out of the box”) ventilators with a goal of FDA clearance or pre-market approval.  Though procurement is not a portion of this contract, eventual unit costs are important for consideration.  The RFP also requests a design to unit cost estimate with a goal of <=$3000 per unit with tiered volume pricing as a consideration for award and further requires design to cost documentation prior to completion of the contract effort.  The goal is to advance the technology to meet the operational and clinical needs during an all-hazards event (caused by chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear exposure, pandemic influenza, other biological outbreak, or natural disaster) and provide respiratory support for large numbers of severely ill patients.  The ventilator must have increased capability to meet operational and clinical needs for treatment of respiratory compromised patients during an all-hazards event in which mass casualties and shortage of experienced care providers may be expected.  The device should be able to provide the same standard of performance as current FDA pre-market cleared portable ventilators but with additional characteristics that meet the following recommended requirements; ease of use for an unskilled care provider, increased patient population range from neonate to adult, portability and useable in a non-clinical environment, standard of care safety, stockpiling and maintenance ease, and use in all hazards events.  The government may procure ventilators on a follow on contract and is interested in defining manufacturing needs through this contract.  Therefore, the government will also require a domestic manufacturing plan addressing the manufacturing processes, production capacity, and ramp up capability to meet emergency surge requirement to supply at least 1700 fully kitted ventilators in one month and to meet a capability goal of at least 10,000 fully kitted units within six (6) months.  Domestic manufacturing is required as well and a plan to ensure production capability if and when foreign components / supplies would be challenged during an event.  

The anticipated period of performance will be a base period of 36 months.  Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.  RFP No. 10-100-SOL-00013 will be available electronically through FedBizOpps on or about March 31, 2010.  Proposals will be due a minimum of 45 days after RFP issuance.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the U.S. Government (USG).  This notice does not commit the USG to the award of a contract.  Only written or email requests directly from the requestor for this solicitation will be accepted.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  All responses to this notice shall be identified with RFP No. 10-100-SOL-00013, name of the firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, FAX number and email address and should be submitted to the Contracting Office address identified in this notice.  Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date of August 2010.  This requirement will be full and open competition.  Small businesses are encouraged to respond.  

Note: A Sources Sought Notice was previously issued for this requirement under 10-100-SOL-00002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">The San Ysidro LPOE is the busiest land port in the world. The existing, outdated 30-year-old facility is </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">obsolete and can no longer support the facilitation nor enforce the missions of the U.S. Customs and </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">Border Protection (CBP). The Port currently processes an average of 50,000 northbound vehicles and </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">25,000 northbound pedestrians per day. The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) predicts </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">an increase in vehicle traffic at San Ysidro of up to 70% by the year 2030. SANDAG's recent study </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">indicates substantial economic impacts of $8.4 billion in lost revenue to the region resulting from </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">increased wait times at the border. Given the delays at current traffic volumes, capacity of the port must </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">be increased to accommodate regional growth.</span></p>

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a Draft Request for Proposals (DRFP) to industry for comments on its requirement for operational test support for The U.S. Army Operational Test Command (USAOTC) Intelligence Electronic Warfare Test Directorate (IEWTD), located at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. The NAICS code is 541330 with a size standard of $27,000.00.  This synopsis is to advise potential offerors of the pending issuance of the DRFP and to give industry an opportunity to request Government opinion regarding Organizational Conflict of Interest.  The anticipated performance period (exclusive of contract transition period) is a six month base period with four one-year options.  The contract type anticipated is Cost-Plus-Award-Fee.  The requirement will be issued as a national competitive 8(a) set-aside pursuant to FAR 19.8.  The requirement calls for the providing of non-personal services to the U.S. Army Operational Test Command (USAOTC) Intelligence Electronic Warfare Test Directorate (IEWTD), in support of its mission to support the operational testing of Army Intelligence and Electronic Warfare (IEW); Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); and Counter Improvised Explosive Devices (CIED) systems and equipment.  Operational testing encompasses a wide range of activities relating to the managing, conducting and reporting of results garnered from material being placed in the hands of soldiers in a field environment. The contract manages and utilizes one-of-a-kind instrumentation systems, which are predominantly computer driven and frequently involve complex modeling/simulation/stimulation. The contract will involve major efforts in  system integration, system and software engineering, data collection, data reduction, data management, equipment maintenance, information technology and test support services in other than an office environment and total contract management of services and support in contract performance. Support occurs at all phases of the IEWTD world-wide mission, e.g., pre-test planning, test execution, and post-test activities.  Augmentation test support based on Government funding is assigned either for long term periods requiring support capabilities for several tests, on a test-by-test basis, or as required.  Contract scope may also include; Modeling and simulation support, automotive maintenance and motor pool operations, information technology & help desk customer support.  The contractor will be provided Government-Furnished Facilities (GFF) at Fort Huachuca, Arizona and Government furnished property required to support the mission. Approximate issuance date of the DRFP is 22 February 2010 with a Pre-solicitation Conference scheduled to be conducted at Fort Huachuca, Arizona on/or about 10 March 2010.  In preparation for the conference, questions and comments on the DRFP is encouraged.  Email questions will be accepted and the email address will be provided in the DRFP.  A cut-off point for receipt of industry written questions and comments on the DRFP, subsequent to the pre-solicitation conference, will be specified in the DFRP.  The respondent is encouraged to review Title 10, US Code Section 2399, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 9.5 prior to responding.  Respondents should note that Title 10, US Code Section 2399, prohibits the utilization of any contractor on an operational test that is involved in the system development or organizationally related to a system developer.  Part 9.5 further addresses contractor responsibilities and restrictions.  This synopsis also invites interested offerors to submit information regarding possible Organizational Conflict of Interests (OCI) that will allow the Government to advise respondents about their potential to be viable competitors.  The advisory opinion will contain sufficient information to permit interested offerors to make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition.  Each respondent will be advised that either it is considered to be a viable competitor for the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  Respondents considered not to be viable competitors will be provided the general basis for the opinion. Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to the submissions, respondents may participate in the acquisition.  The following information is required to be provided in writing to the address below in order to receive an OCI advisory opinion. Respondents must explain, in detail, the nature of any involvement in Defense Systems, with specific emphasis on Department of Army Systems and Joint Programs. The respondent must describe the specific work performed and the duration thereof as either a prime or subcontractor.  The respondent must lay-down the corporate structure, specifically addressing the interrelationship, if any, of corporate assets that performed any development effort.  The respondent must state whether or not it considers its involvement an organizational conflict of interest prohibited by the referenced statute and regulation or an appearance of such a conflict that could adversely impact the test and evaluation mission.  The respondent must provide a detailed rationale for the position.  Failure to provide the required information will be deemed non-responsive; incomplete packages will be returned and no opinion will be provided.  Interested parties should submit their OCI information in writing to the Contracting Officer at the ATEC Mission Support Contracting Activity, P.O. Box Y, Fort Hood Texas, 76544-0770.  Verbal requests will not be entertained regarding any information in this announcement.  All inquiries must be submitted in writing.  Issuance of the final RFP will not be synopsized.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Fort Collins, Colorado, is seeking interested parties with the intention of negotiating a contract for the following services:
<p>The objective of the proposed project is to deliver a user-friendly, scientifically-valuable, digital diagnostic tool (morphology and molecular) for officials working on the table grape export work plans for Australia and New Zealand. Inadequate spider identification capabilities have resulted in losses and delays that have limited full realization of market potential. The development of the proposed digital diagnostic tool will assist in preventing potential errors in spider identification which limits potential export volume.</p>
<p>The development of Lucid keys, based on morphological features for both adults and eggs of concern for these countries will enable the county entomologists associated with the Central Valley of California to quickly key out the spider and obtain correct identification allowing those grape lots without spiders of concern to be certified for export and remain in the export program to these countries for the remainder of the season. It may be found that morphology might not be valuable enough to clearly identify spider eggs; therefore, the tool will also include a DNA sequence search page to allow the identification of an egg.</p>
<p>Description of Work<br />Proposed work consists of designing, developing, deploying, and delivering a digital diagnostic tool for Spiders Associated with California Central Valley Exported Table Grapes which includes:</p>
<p>1. Create a Lucid key(s), including the following: <br />a. scoring the Lucid key(s) (adults and eggs) for all relevant taxa relevant to, or may be relevant to, our trading partners for table grapes (Australian and New Zealand) <br />b. obtaining and/or photographing the taxa included in the key for the key image gallery and fact sheets <br />c. producing, when appropriate and relevant, illustrations and/or images for features and feature states <br />d. producing fact sheets for all taxa included in key <br />e. attaching appropriate images, illustrations, and fact sheets to the features, states, and entities in the key.</p>
<p>2. Obtain DNA sequence data for each taxon included in the morphological key. Develop an Html search page linked to a database to support the use of a sequence for identifying an egg.</p>
<p>3. Create Html resource pages (outside of the key) as required for the development of the tool's website (Lucid tool = Lucid key plus resource pages). These will include, but not be limited to a discussion about the scope of the tool, system requirements to use the key, relevant references and other resources, etc. <br />4. Seek and obtain peer and client reviews for the beta version of the tool. Seek support for the process from CPHST ITP. Create final version based on these reviews. Deploy final version on www.lucidcentral.org. <br />5. Ensure that all work conforms to CPHST ITP standards and requirements for Lucid identification tools. Work in collaboration with CPHST ITP to ensure that all steps in tool development are completed in a timely efficient manner.</p>
<p>QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>At a minimum, the individual shall meet the following qualifications: <br />Possession of a graduate degree (M.S. and/or Ph.D.) in zoology with an emphasis on Arachnology</p>
<p>Experience using and studying Arachnid nomenclature and taxonomy</p>
<p>Ability to circumscribe Arachnid taxa based on morphological characters</p>
<p>Experience undertaking field work to find and collect spider adults and eggs</p>
<p>Ability and experience collecting and rearing spider eggs to adults</p>
<p>Experience using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and spreadsheet software</p>
<p>Experience developing identification keys and/or screening aids for spiders</p>
<p>Experience using a compound microscope and stereoscope</p>
<p>Skill in capturing photographs and photomicrographs of spiders, including their morphological features</p>
<p>Already networked within the Arachnid scientific community</p>
<p>The purpose of this sources sought is to determine acquisition strategy would be interested AND capable of providing the service. Based upon the responses to this notice the Government will decide to compete full and open or set-aside the requirement for small businesses.</p>
<p>Companies responding to this sources sought notice shall submit a statement of capabilities. Failure to submit a statement of capabilities will not prevent a company from being eligible to submit a proposal.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall submit via email to Joanne Mann the following information<br />Joanne.Mann@aphis.usda.gov</p>
<p>1. Cover page with company name, address, DUNS number, point of contact with phone number and email address<br />2. Evidence of expertise in Arachnology<br />3. Resume addressing the qualifications as shown above<br />4. 2-3 references</p>
<p>This announcement does not commit the Government to award of a contract. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within 5 days of publication of this notice.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), Center for Plant Health Sciences &amp; Technology (CPHST), Fort Collins, Colorado, is seeking interested parties with the intention of negotiating a contract for the development of a Lucid tool for the upgrade of taxonomic identification resources for table grape weed seed flora for the California Central Valley growing area.
<p>The export program for California Table Grapes to Australia, New Zealand, and UK requires that specific pests and weed seeds of concern are identified to species in order for the lot to be certified for export to these countries. The development of a Lucid tool for the weed seeds of concern for these countries will enable the county and state entomologists to quickly key out the seed and obtain correct identification allowing those grape lots without seeds of concern to be certified for export and remain in the export program to these countries for the remainder of the season</p>
<p>DESRIPTION OF WORK<br />The objective of the proposed project is to significantly upgrade the taxonomic identification resources for officials working on the table grape export work plans for Australia and New Zealand, county inspectors, state identifiers, and off-shore ports of entry inspectors. Inadequate weed seed identification capabilities have resulted in losses and delays that have limited full realization of market potential. The development of the proposed digital diagnostic tool will assist in preventing potential errors in weed seed identification which limits potential export volume.</p>
<p>The work consists of designing, developing, deploying, and delivering to CPHST an electronic, matrix-based Lucid diagnostic tool to be tentatively entitled Identification Tool to the Weed Seeds Associated with California Central Valley Table Grapes. It is expected that the tool will include approximately 300 species of weed seeds.</p>
<p>1. Create a Lucid tool, including scoring the Lucid key for the all taxa, obtaining, observing and photographing the taxa, and attaching photographs and fact sheets to the key.<br />2. Prepare a fact sheet for each taxon based on literature, research, and observation.<br />3. Prepare appropriate feature and state image and illustration pages to attach to features and states to support the users of the key<br />4. Create Html resource pages, outside of the key as required for the development of the tool's website. <br />5. Create final version based on CPHST's peer/client review of the beta version of the tool.<br />6. Provide CPHST, via a CD, with all electronic files associated with creating and deploying the Lucid tool.<br />7. Ensure that all work conforms to CPHST ITP standards and requirements for Lucid identification tools. <br />8. Consult and establish relationships with external experts, weed scientists, and others, as needed.</p>
<p>QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>At a minimum, the individual shall meet the following qualifications:</p>
<p>&bull; Possession of a graduate degree (M.S. and/or Ph.D.) in botany, preferably in taxonomy or systematics<br />&bull; Experience using and studying botanical nomenclature and taxonomy<br />&bull; Ability to circumscribe taxa based on morphological characters and the variation of these characters<br />&bull; Knowledge of flowering plant seed morphology<br />&bull; Experience using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and spreadsheet software<br />&bull; Experience using Lucid software<br />&bull; Experience developing keys for seeds<br />&bull; Experience using a compound microscope and stereoscope <br />&bull; Skill in capturing photographs and photomicrographs of plant parts, including their morphological features, to support the identification process<br />&bull; Be willing to undertake work associated with milestones that require access to specialized equipment and software available at the CPHST Fort Collins Laboratory</p>
<p>The purpose of this sources sought is to determine acquisition strategy would be interested AND capable of providing the service. Based upon the responses to this notice the Government will decide to compete full and open or set-aside the requirement for small businesses.</p>
<p>Companies responding to this sources sought notice shall submit a statement of capabilities. Failure to submit a statement of capabilities will not prevent a company from being eligible to submit a proposal.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall submit via email to Joanne Mann the following information<br />Joanne.Mann@aphis.usda.gov</p>
<p>1. Cover page with company name, address, DUNS number, point of contact with phone number and email address<br />2. Evidence of expertise in botany, taxonomy or systematics<br />3. Resume addressing the qualifications <br />4. 2-3 references</p>
<p>This announcement does not commit the Government to award of a contract. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within 5 days of publication of this notice.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)  A Lethal Miniature Aerial Munition System (LMAMS)<BR>Pursuant to FAR 15.201, this notice is being issued as a Research and Development Request for Information (RFI) Sought.  The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), Redstone Arsenal, AL, on behalf of the U.S. Army, desires to obtain US domestic sources of information to serve as a market survey to aid in programmatic planning for advanced technology development and demonstration for a Lethal Miniature Aerial Munition System (LMAMS) material solution.  The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but desires information on capability, technology maturity and risk, price, innovative methodologies and other information to be used in LMAMS strategy formulation.  <BR>1.  Subject:  The LMAMS is designed to provide a soldier carried, soldier ground launched Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) loitering precision guided system organic at the small unit level that allows unprecedented engagement of enemy combatants without exposing the Warfighter to direct enemy fires. <BR>2.  Description:  As a result of issuing this RFI, the Government expects to receive technical data describing the proposed concept and innovative methodology information to assist in the following programmatic planning:  (1) Determine the ability of current and near term emerging technology to support an LMAMS, (2) Identify feasible system concept alternatives that meet the objectives stated in Paragraph 3, below, (3) Determine the approximate cost information for each alternative, and (4) Determine the estimated performance characteristics associated with each alternative.<BR>Interested and capable sources are asked to submit a white paper containing a description of the above areas of interest.  Submissions should focus on information concerning available, emerging, or required LMAMS technologies, for which proof-of-concept has been demonstrated at least at the subsystem/component level, and for which an implementation roadmap for a form-factored system solution has been identified and is clearly communicated. The white paper responses shall be written from a system solution perspective showing how the technologies identified above would be integrated into a LMAMS materiel solution, tested, and qualified for military application in a typical military operating environment.<BR>3.  Capabilities:  This capabilities section enumerates the high-level functional capabilities for LMAMS.  The contemplated LMAMS would provide the ground combatant Soldier a NLOS day/night capable precision guided system with the ability to effectively engage and retarget personnel/non-standard vehicle targets.  LMAMS will provide increased lethality by quickly locating, tracking, and engaging time sensitive, fleeting targets, or enemy in defilade without operator exposure to threat precision small arms fire.  <BR><BR>A LMAMS system shall consist of 1 each Ground Control Station (GCS) (includes data link, associated cables and equipment, and mission planning functions), and 2 each Munitions (includes airframe, integrated electro-optic & infrared sensors, warhead, data link, and launcher (if required)).  The LMAMS GCS shall be day/night readable, providing the user real time video from the munition. The GCS shall provide the operator the ability to conduct the following: autonomously control the munition in flight, manually control the munition in flight, select predetermined targets using geo location reference, visually select and identify targets of opportunity, loiter, abort, abort and redirect, arm/disarm, and manually command warhead detonation. <BR>Three distinct mission phases are mission planning, fly out, and terminal engagement.  For mission planning purposes, targeting information provided to the operator may consist of headings, geo location reference, or landmark information provided by direct observation from the operator, other observers, or by sensors and networks separate from LMAMS.  The operator will use this information to perform mission planning with the GCS to autonomously fly to the area of interest or to decide to manually fly LMAMS to the area of interest. For the fly out, the LMAMS must be able to be launched quickly by a single operator, and fly an assigned route or path to a target area.  The LMAMS will be capable of loitering.  In the terminal engagement phase, the LMAMS will have the ability to automatically track a target designated by the operator in the terminal phase or allow the operator to manually control the system as needed to focus on a specific area or point of interest.   The system must have lethal effects against personnel in the open and personnel in moving soft-skinned vehicles (sedan, pick-up truck) while minimizing collateral damage.  LMAMS must have the ability to automatically track a target designated by the operator in the terminal phase of an engagement with no further operator input in a cluttered environment or within restricted terrain.  The operator shall have the ability to abort and or redirect the flight path prior to impact.  <BR>The launcher (if required), munition, sensor, and warhead combined weights shall be less than or equal to 5.5 lbs and a length of less than or equal to 22 inches.  LMAMS shall have a flight endurance of greater than 5 minutes and a range of greater than 3 km.  The munition shall have a power source capable of meeting the endurance and range requirements above with a shelf life of at least six months.  <BR>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those high-level capabilities discussed above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.  <BR>4.  Responses:  To assist in assessing current and future products and technologies capable of achieving the LMAMS requirements and developing a future path for LMAMS, the Government is requesting information from industry.  Interested parties should submit white papers not to exceed 15 pages, with one inch margins, and no smaller than 10  12 pt Times New Roman or Courier New font in Microsoft Word format.

<DESC>The U.S. Forest Service is trying to determine if there are any interested businesses willing to provide services for a review of large fire cost expenditures within the U.S Forest Service. 

Requirements for Large Fire Cost Review:

The contractor will be responsible for bringing together a diverse team with expertise in the areas of wildland fire management, land management, risk management, and wildfire suppression strategies.  The contractor will recruit skilled personnel from other land management and response agencies, and possibly other countries, to review the agency’s response to wildfires.  This might include specialists from the military, academia, industry, and emergency agencies for expertise in land management, wildland fire management, risk management, and large field operations involving ground and air assets and catastrophic threats to the public. 

The contractor will coordinate and oversee the work of the Independent Panel. The panel is tasked with examining and reporting on fire suppression costs for wildfire incidents during Fiscal Year 2009 where federal expenditures exceeded $10,000,000.  The panel’s purpose will be to determine if the agency exercised fiscal diligence in managing specific incident suppression activities.  This panel is not expected to complete an exhaustive fiscal audit of all incident phases.  Rather, the focus will be on evaluating how these large fires were managed.   The Review objectives for this year’s panel should focus, as possible, on the following areas:

• Evaluating the risk-based management of these large fires from a systems standpoint – from planning and decision-making through implementation and the outcomes that resulted.  For each of these stages, people, skills, and technology should be assessed and what in the system worked well and what in the system needs to be improved should be identified.

• Assessing the utilization of new processes, guidance, expectations and tools that have changed the business of fire management in recent years in an effort to determine the impact these changes have had and develop a baseline for comparison in future years as these efforts mature.

• Determining whether the agency’s current review process is yielding positive changes and identifying ways to improve the agency’s current fire review processes.

If the panel finds instances where the agency may not have executed prudent fiscal decisions with respect to public/firefighter safety, natural resource, and private property protection, estimate the proportions of appropriate and excess suppression costs (recognizing that “excess costs’ would be earmarked for return to the treasury based on end of fiscal year 2009 balances). 

Summarize findings in a report to the Secretary of Agriculture.

Respondents are requested to provide information on services that address the above requirements. Include the following information in your responses:

1.	Description of similar contract services provided in the past.
2.	References and contact information of customers that have utilized similar  services.
3.	Company size status in relation to NAICS code 541620 and size standard ($7 Mil).
4.	CCR profile information (if currently registered)


Responses will be used to determine if the Forest Service will proceed with a Request for Quote.

Only written responses will be evaluated. Any questions must be submitted in writing or via e-mail. Voicemails and telephone calls will not be permitted and may not be answered.

<DESC>This is a request for information/sources sought notice(RFI) to assist the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) for the purpose of conducting market research.  A solicitation is not currently available, and unsolicited proposals in responses to this RFI will not be accepted.  The NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland is conducting market research for the following : DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK -  BACKGROUND - The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award was created by Public Law 100-107. The Award Program led to the creation of a new public-private partnership. Principal support for the program comes from the U.S Government and the Foundation for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. The Award is named for Malcolm Baldrige, who served as Secretary of Commerce from 1981. The Baldrige National Quality Program (BNQP) helps stimulate American organizations to strive for performance excellence; recognizes the achievements of organizations that can serve as U.S. role models for performance and innovation; establishes guidelines and criteria that can be used by business, education, health care, government, and other organizations in evaluating their own quality improvement efforts; and provides specific guidance for American organizations wishing to learn how to manage for high performance by making available detailed information on how Award Recipient organizations were able to change their cultures and achieve eminence. In addition, BNQP ensures broad distribution of the criteria and award process through numerous means, including a multitude of State and Local Quality Award programs that benefit from the free availability of the criteria, training materials, and Baldrige process documentation. These State and Local programs have increased exponentially the reach and impact of BNQP. 
Over the course of many years, it has become apparent that due to a variety of challenges, including limited funding, many State and Local programs struggle to remain viable. The goal is to increase the quality and sustainability of these programs and to strengthen the feeder system to the Baldrige National Quality Program, including preservation and promotion of the Baldrige brand. This contract will fund the management of an initiative to create and administer a voluntary program that would use the Baldrige Criteria and Organizational Profiles to help improve state and local programs, and therefore enhance their ability to help other organizations improve, to improve the quality of their Examiners, and ultimately, improve the applicants and examiners that come from the state level to the national level.  SCOPE OF WORK - The Contractor shall develop an evaluation process by which they will utilize the Baldrige Criteria to evaluate participating State and Local Baldrige-based programs. Programs would be eligible for financial incentives to participate and may submit proposals in order to address their most significant opportunities for improvement (OFI’s) identified through the evaluation process. 
There will be four levels of participation depending on the maturity and current capability of the state or local program, as judged by the program itself.
The specific subset of the criteria to be used at each of the four levels will be proposed by the contractor and approved by the COTR Financial incentives at each level will be proposed by the contractor. Funding amounts to address most significant OFI’s will be proposed by the applicant program, and adjusted or accepted by the contractor in conjunction with input from other state and local programs. State programs with their own tiered levels may utilize their own criteria, as long as the criteria are Baldrige-based.
Evaluations of programs will be performed by a panel of reviewers from among the Alliance of Performance Excellence Network and selected in such a way as to avoid conflicts of interest. 
The contractor will establish a consistent review process and qualified pool of assessors, notify State and Local programs of the opportunity, manage the evaluation process, provide feedback to applicant programs, manage a systematic, fair, and equitable process for funding efforts to improve key OFI’s, and ensure that the funds is being  used appropriately. The contractor will also submit quarterly reports on key activities, applicants reviewed, and funds awarded.
The Contractor shall provide all support for project oversight, equipment, administration and technical execution of this contract.  The Contractor is responsible for maintaining accurate records of project activities. DELIVERABLES AND DELIVERABLE DUE DATA - The Contractor shall provide the following deliverables:
1)	Develop and manage a process to evaluate State and Local Quality programs using the Baldrige criteria at four different levels ranging from review of an organizational profile to a complete 50 page application.

<CONTACT>Bruce E. Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2234, Fax 301-443-0501, Email banderso@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement.
<p>Background. On October, 9, 2008, The World Health Organization (WHO) launched its Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP) which aims at scaling up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders in countries especially with low- and middle-income populations, thus to reduce the significant gap between the minority who do receive these services and the majority that don't. The program asserts that with proper care, psychosocial assistance and medication, tens of millions could be treated for depression, schizophrenia, and epilepsy, prevented from suicide and begin to lead normal lives- even where resources are scarce.</p>
<p>Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP) will provide health planners, policy-makers, and donors with a set of clear and coherent activities and programs for scaling up care for mental, neurological, and substance use (MNS) disorders.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on all sources capable of developing, implementing, and evaluating the World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Program (mhGAP).</p>
<p>One goal of this initiative will be to conduct comparative research on the implementation and scale-up of evidence-based mental health interventions in low- and middle-income settings (LMICs). The mhGAP initiative aims to deliver an integrated package of evidence-based interventions taking into account existing and possible barriers for scaling up care. The interventions focus on eight (8) high disease burden and high cost conditions, including depression, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, suicide, and mental disorders in children. Through this initiative, the NIMH stands to make a significant impact on the treatment and course of mental disorders in LMICs by supporting a program of multidisciplinary research on implementation of effective interventions and comparative studies in multiple country settings.</p>
<p>The overarching priority of this initiative is the development of sound methods to study the implementation of evidence-based packages of mental health care in low- and middle-income countries. To that end, formative field studies will be designed to address four (4) broad goals: (1) Understanding the social and policy environments that facilitate scale up of mental health interventions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; (2) Studying cultural barriers and facilitators of scale up; (3)Assessment of the acceptability and social validity of individual and combined packages of care across settings as well as across populations at risk of exclusion from services; and (4) Refinement of methods to assess the efficacy of multilevel intervention implementation.</p>
<p>Project Requirements. Qualified sources will be required to: 1) develop protocols for a situational analysis for implementation of mhGAP; 2) conduct a situational analysis of the mental health system in 3-5 selected LMICs; 3) based on the situational analyses, develop protocols for implementation research on mhGAP; and 4) evaluate the implementation process in the selected LMICs.</p>
<p>Other important considerations. In order to perform this work, qualified sources shall have:</p>
<p>1) Access to the collaborative research networks developed in the WHO-AIMS study (see http://www.who.int/en/) in order to develop protocols for implementation of World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Program<br /><br />2) The infrastructure to establish international field study centers in 3-5 low- and middle-income countries (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, Asia)</p>
<p>3) Current international collaborations with investigators who have a record of productive research focused on mental health services research and implementation science in LMICs</p>
<p>4) Experience/expertise in epidemiology, intervention and implementation science, and mixed methods research.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance. The resulting contract has an anticipated period of performance of 3 years.</p>
<p>Capability Statement. Any business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (5-10pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the described work. Capability Statements should describe (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information (f) any other resources available to support this project.</p>
<p>Responses to this Sources Sought Notice are due by February 22, 2010, 4:30 PM local time.</p>
<p>Responses can be sent by mail, fax, or E-mail to: <br />Bruce E. Anderson<br />Contracting Officer,NIH/NIMH<br />6001 Executive Blvd, Room 8154 (MSC 9661)<br />Rockville, Maryland 20892<br />Fax: 301-443-0501<br />E-mail: banderso@mail.nih.gov</p>

<DESC>SHARED CONDOMINIUM HOUSING DEVELOPMENT – VIENNA, AUSTRIA

SAQMMA-10-VIENNA

The United States Government (“USG”) is seeking Expressions of Interest from qualified developers to share in the redevelopment of two USG owned residential compounds located in the 19th District in Vienna, Austria into residential condominium developments.  The existing compounds are underdeveloped. All existing buildings are expected to be razed in the redevelopment.  According to feasibility study performed by a Vienna based architectural/engineering firm, the compounds can support 90+ units under the existing zoning.  As conceived, in lieu of cash payment for the land, the USG would receive free and clear a portion of the developer constructed units scattered amongst the compounds.   Both the USG and the developer/partner would own their portion of the units in freehold.  
The USG portion of the units should contain a mix of two (2), three (3) and four (4) bedroom units containing between 133 and 214 square meters in net saleable area (NSA).  The NSA does not include balcony/patio areas, nor does it include basement parking spaces.  The USG portion of the units must have a parking ratio of 1.5 spaces per unit.  The building styles should be designed in a manner that both maximizes the overall number of units and is in harmony with the surrounding neighborhood area.  Said design can be townhouses, apartments or a combination thereof.  All of the housing units should contain certain amenities including patios or balconies, high quality appliances, and nicely appointed details throughout.  The buildings should also be designed with energy conservation in mind.  The USG also expects efforts to be made to preserve as much green space as possible on the overall compounds, with an emphasis towards preservation of mature trees.  The overall housing compound should also contain perimeter fencing of an ornamental nature and some form of controlled access.

<DESC><strong>ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES (ACF) HEAD START TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS</strong>
<p>Contracting Office Address:</p>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Park lawn Building Room 5-101 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD, 20857, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), INVITATION FOR BID (IFB), REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ), OR AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT ASSUME THE GOVERNMENT WILL AWARD A CONTRACT OR PROCEED WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE SOLICITATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS NOTICE IS ONLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES.</p>
<p>This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g. 8 (a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUB Zone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) to provide State Training and Technical Assistance Centers (TTA) to local grantees across the United States and its territories.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to procure State Training and Technical Assistance Centers that will provide local grantees with high-quality, sustained, and intensive training and technical assistance that, "to the maximum extent practicable," improves the capacity of local programs to deliver services that meet or exceed the standards described in section 641 (A)(a)(1) of the Head Start Act, within the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; School readiness<br />&bull; Training/career development needs of staff<br />&bull; Correction of deficiencies</p>
<p>The Office of Head Start is seeking the procurement of up to 52 State Training and Technical Assistance Centers that will secure services of at least one Early Childhood Education specialist in every state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico who possess demonstrable and credible experience in the field of early childhood education. Specific expertise is sought from offerors providing training and technical assistance strategies that positively impact the developmental and educational outcomes for children birth to five.</p>
<p>Each state will include at least one early childhood education (ECE) specialist, with the number of ECE specialists increased in accord with the number of grantees and delegates within a state. The work of these specialists will be directed toward two of the three priority areas: school readiness and the training/career development needs of teaching staff. In each state one ECE specialist shall function as the Center Manager.</p>
<p>The Early Childhood Education (ECE) specialist position requires a degree and qualifications in Early Childhood Education/Development at the bachelor's degree level with masters' degree preferred and a minimum of five years experience in programs for young children. The degree and experience for a least one ECE specialist per state must be inclusive of both birth to three and three to five year old development and learning. This experience should include the provision of training and technical assistance to teachers/home visitors and education managers. For states staffed by more than one ECE specialist, the education and experience of one specialist may be specific to children from birth to three; the education and experience of the second specialist may be specific to children from three to five. For states staffed by more than one specialist, it is also recommended that each specialist have experience and/or education with the implementation of effective strategies for working with unique special populations of children.</p>
<p>In addition, the government is seeking to secure the services of at least one Grantee Specialist for each of the ten ACF Regions. These specialists will be deployed by the regional office to work on the third priority area: deficiencies identified through the monitoring system. In regions with few grantees with identified deficiencies, the grantee specialists may also be deployed to work with grantees with multiple areas of noncompliance, grantees with concerns raised through risk management meetings, or with grantees about which concerns have been raised though other data sources, such as the Program Information Report (PIR). In order to facilitate and support close communication between these grantee specialists and the regional office, these specialists will be employed by the TTA Center in the State where the regional office is located.</p>
<p>These states are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Region I - Massachusetts<br />&bull; Region II - New York<br />&bull; Region II - Philadelphia<br />&bull; Region IV - Georgia<br />&bull; Region V - Illinois<br />&bull; Region VI - Texas<br />&bull; Region VII - Missouri<br />&bull; Region VIII - Colorado<br />&bull; Region IX - California<br />&bull; Region X - Washington</p>
<p>The Grantee Specialist position requires a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science (BA or BS) Degree-with a preference for a Master's degree in a field related to program design and management. A minimum of five years experience in the provision of training and technical assistance and consultation with directors, boards of directors, staff and parents; and experience analyzing and redesigning systems for grantees. Both positions, the Early Childhood Specialist and the Grantee Specialist, require a significant background in the use of reliable data collection systems that track measurable outcomes for children and programs.</p>
<p>Finally, there will be one TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist for each of the ten regions. (See above.) As is true with the grantee specialists, this individual will be employed by the state Center in which the regional office is located and will work with regional office staff to coordinate the work of the State TTA Centers within that region.</p>
<p>The TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist requires a BA or BS Degree-with a preference for a Master's degree in a field related to program design and management. A minimum of five years experience in the provision of training and technical assistance and consultation with directors, boards of directors, staff and parents; experience analyzing and redesigning systems for grantees.</p>
<p>The number of Early Childhood Education Specialists, Grantee Specialists, and TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialists depend upon the number of grantees and delegates per state. Attachment 1 provides the estimated level of effort in each state.</p>
<p>Offerors may propose staff that lives near, but not in, the state for which the capability statement is being written. However, it is required that all individuals have some relationships established with the early education community in that state.</p>
<p>To provide economies of scale, the use of home offices is strongly encouraged. Services may be provided off-site, on-site, through virtual media, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p>The Head Start Act requires individual TTA contracts be awarded for each State unless grantees agree to the formation of a consortium of two or more States within a geographic region. At this time there is no information available as to whether grantees in any states will give permission for a consortium. However, additional information will be provided in the RFP.</p>
<p>In addition to the educational requirements detailed above, the minimum contractor requirements are:</p>
<p>(1) The capacity to implement comprehensive training and technical assistance for the Early Head Start and Head Start community.</p>
<p>(2) Demonstrated experience supporting the training and technical assistance needs of early childhood programs serving children from birth to five, specifically with programs serving infants and toddlers.</p>
<p>(3) Institutional experience collaborating with state-level early childhood organizations such as Head Start Collaboration Office, State Advisory councils, State Head Start Associations, Child Care and other organizations that represent early childhood providers within states.</p>
<p>(4) Demonstrated experience providing training and technical assistance specific to child assessment, curriculum implementation and selection.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstrated experience providing early childhood programs with training and technical assistance that is developmentally, culturally, and linguistically appropriate to a variety of populations.</p>
<p>(6) The capacity to recruit and retain highly skilled professionals in accordance with the mandatory educational/experience requirements listed above for: Early Childhood Education (ECE) specialist, Grantee Specialist, and TTA Coordinator/Grantee Specialist.</p>
<p>Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via email to pscacquisitions@psc.hhs.gov; Attention Erica Binnix.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE, INCLUDING ANY TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS AND SHOULD NOT EXCEED 50 PAGES.</p>
<p>Please respond only to the information stated above on a state by state basis. Identify the state or states in which the respondent has the capacity to serve. Offerors are not required to include any information regarding consortiums.</p>
<p>Capability statements must also include the following information: Company name, address, DUNS, Point of Contact, Phone and Email address of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses, and business size and status (e.g., small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUB Zone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business). Teaming Arrangements are encouraged. All teaming arrangements shall also include the above-cited information and certifications for each entity on the proposed team.</p>
<p>Responses are requested by 1:00 pm EST February 16, 2010. Capability statements will not be accepted after the due date.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information in support of planning / acquisition strategy development for a modernization or replacement of the COBRA DANE Radar System
<p>Notice Type: <br />Special Announcement, Request for Information</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997).<br /><br />(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or, to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts, as provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulation subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs.</p>
<p>(b) Although the terms "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, a response received from a contractor will be treated as INFORMATION ONLY and shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>(c) Background. The COBRA DANE Radar System (AN/FPS-108) located at Shemya, Alaska supports technical data collection on Strategic Missile System tests for purposes of treaty verification, tracking of Earth orbiting satellites, and threat missile target tracking, object acquisition and classification in support of Ground-based Midcourse Defense. The present system is a traveling wave tube fed phased array, all weather, long-range radar that operates within the L-Band. The system is a single-face phased array system with wide instantaneous field of view. The measurement of the radar face is approximately 95 feet in diameter and the overall radar height is 120 feet.</p>
<p>The radar system was operational in 1976 with a major modernization in 1993. In 2004, a modification added missile defense to mission support functionality. Significant elements of the system are beginning to experience supportability issues, and the government is exploring options to either fully replace or, modernize the existing system. The government currently is contracted with a non-conflicted source to conduct an analysis of several alternatives and to provide comparative estimates of technical feasibility, performance, risk, and cost associated with the options.</p>
<p>In support of this activity, the government is requesting information from interested sources on approaches and possibilities that may be considered for upgrading the system. The information developed will be used by the study team to aid the government to help define its funding needs, technical approaches, and acquisition strategy to modernize or, replace the system.</p>
<p>The fundamental requirements are:<br />- Preservation of the overall mission support capabilities of the existing system<br />- Minimization of system downtime during system replacement or modernization<br />- Affordable acquisition<br />- Exploitation of new capabilities inherent with new technologies</p>
<p>The modernization approach assumes reuse of the existing facility and array, and is bound by the constraints of that facility. The replacement approach assumes a new facility collocated near the existing facility.</p>
<p>The government will host a classified SECRET Industry Day Conference on Wednesday, 10 March 2010 from 0800 until 1230 at the 343d Security Forces Squadron Training Facility, Bldg 10215, 1325 Harmon Drive, in the Carter Hall Auditorium, Lackland AFB, Texas. The conference will provide interested sources an opportunity to better understand the government needs and planning efforts to date which will enable industry to provide the government with additional view points of candidate options. Sources are expected to have a demonstrated capability to design, develop, and deploy systems of this magnitude, and must have the appropriate facility and personnel security clearances to participate. Following the conference briefing, there will be an opportunity for questions and group discussion at the SECRET level with the government technical POCs, mission stakeholders, and the study team members.<br /><br />On or about12 April 2010, interested parties are requested to submit a written response to the government addressing the following questions based on the study needs. The government will provide additional guidance to prepare and deliver a written response at the Conference.</p>
<p>Parties are requested to discuss the following:</p>
<p>1. Describe your concept for high-level modernizing (in-place) of the existing COBRA DANE system with minimal system downtime.<br />2. Describe your concept for high-level replacement of the existing system with a new design system (for planning purpose with the assumption that the new facility will be located adjacent to the existing system). <br />3. Provide rough order of magnitude cost and schedule estimates for implementing your concept(s). <br />4. What risks are foreseen in performing this effort? What steps would you likely take to mitigate the risks? What costs are incurred for mitigation?<br />5. Describe any emerging technologies under development that may be directly applicable to a COBRA DANE modernization or, replacement effort; such as, high resolution data collection, solid-state array technology, digital beam forming, object classification, etc.</p>
<p>All personnel and organizations participating in the evaluation have no known conflict of interests with this activity. All personnel will have signed non-disclosure agreements and any proprietary information provided will be protected as such.</p>
<p>The COBRA DANE background brief presented at the Industry Day Conference will be classified as SECRET NOFORN. After the conference, the briefing will be posted on the SIPRNet website (see below) to all appropriately cleared companies that participate. <br /><br />Attendance at COBRA DANE Industry Day Conference requires companies to have recent experience (i.e., within the last 3 years) as a government prime contractor, subcontractor or, material supplier; and on contracts involving radar systems is expected. The company must possess a minimum security facility clearance of SECRET with no foreign owned, controlled, or influenced issues (FOCI), and have a valid contract CAGE CODE. Individual attendees are required to have a minimum clearance of SECRET. Parties planning to attend are required to register under their respective company name on SIPRNet at:<br />http://www.afisr.af.smil.mil/homepages/a58/A9Y/COBRADANE_2010/Documents/COBRADANE_Briefs.cfm. <br />Or, as an option, e-mail registration information to the Administrative Industry Day POC by providing the following: Individual's full legal name, social security number, along with citizenship along with the company name, mailing address, and CAGE CODE no later than 1200 (EST) on Monday, 22 February 2010.</p>

A. General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Request for Information (RFI) regarding potential sources. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires. The NAICS Code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This announcement is a RFI for planning purposes only.

The intent of this RFI is to conduct market research to identify sources to support informed decisions to procure for the required services, i.e., a  large business, total small business set-aside action  (e.g., SBA Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned,), GSA task order, etc.  This notice is a RFI for all interested qualified businesses that meet the requirements for this effort. Small businesses are highly encouraged to respond.

This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  


B.  Project Background:

Initiatives to compare the effectiveness of different medical interventions and approaches to their delivery have attracted tremendous interest.  While comparative effectiveness research (CER) has typically been associated with enhancing the efficiency in the use of health care resources are used, there is a broader vision of the potential goals and benefits of such research.  CER could extend beyond the application of specific intervention methods to controlled clinical trials or within specific health care settings.  For example CER could be used to better understand what interventions work best for individuals and subgroups within populations. 
As such, CER can be instrumental in supporting and driving the development of personalized medicine, and improving not only the efficiency of care, but also outcomes for all individuals.  The science can be used to increase patient benefit, by identifying individuals who are most likely to benefit from an intervention, and to reduce risks, by identifying and protecting individuals who may be harmed.  The hope of personalized medicine is that new and existing therapies and devices will be used in combination with improved diagnostic assessments to develop a tailored strategy for treating each patient.  
A significant step in achieving this goal is to define subtypes or subpopulations of patients with disease, such that different therapies, often with different targets and mechanisms of action, can be compared with respect to how they perform in each of these subtypes.  Within the FDA, the intent is to help provide a scientific framework that can capitalize on increased CER efforts to better realize these goals of personalized medicine.  
The FDA houses the largest known repository of clinical study data--including data on drug biologics and devices safety, effectiveness and performance.  These data are an invaluable resource for CER.  Both pre- and post-approval data collected and housed at the FDA can be combined with other datasets on long term health outcomes that reside in other agencies or the private sector.  As personalized medicine develops, FDA expects an increase in the need for comparisons across products (and associated delivery mechanisms) to define how these products should be used in combination for individualized health care before and after FDA approval. Development and use of sound, consistent science-based approaches to the design, conduct and analysis of such data; and the assessment for labeling and regulatory purposes, will be critical. 

C. Objective:
The Partnership in Applied Comparative Effectiveness Science (PACES) is an initiative that seeks to advance the science for such CER studies through leveraging available data, in particular the joint ARRA FDA-CER efforts, to form an enhanced standardized database, Janus. The PACES initiative will be conducted with centers residing outside of the FDA who have medical, biological, and clinically relevant computational expertise. These centers will work with FDA Center scientific and statistical experts to define questions, datasets and approaches for performing complex analyses for comparative and multi-study analyses on FDA and other large clinical datasets.  As part of this effort these Centers will conduct analyses on defined datasets including datasets previously developed as part the joint Janus initiative, where Center specific questions will drive the data transformed, standardized and loaded into the Janus data warehouse.   Additionally, PACES Centers will be expected to participate in FDA-hosted scientific workshops that address issues such as methods for cross-study and other comparative analyses, best practices in CER, and candidate studies and their design and analysis methods. These strategies will also encompass clinical trial designs that can help advance personalized medicine and health outcomes both within and outside of the FDA.
The Government intends on using a contract or contract(s) to establish two PACES Centers, each through a separate contract (or set of task orders) awarded to potentially two different Contractors. Each Contractor will establish a PACES Center to develop and use advanced computational strategies and tools to conduct CER.  Using CER methodologies, these Centers will address potential uses of large FDA datasets as well as or in conjunction with health outcomes data from other sources.  In addition, the Centers will help to develop innovative clinical trial design and data analysis strategies that can be used by the Government to facilitate prospective studies that incorporate CER and personalized medicine approaches.  
The PACES Centers will provide scientific training and collaboration to benefit future FDA-CER efforts and enhance academic capacity and expertise in product related data.  These training efforts will promote collaborative interactions with FDA scientific staff including support of Postdoctoral Fellows both within the FDA and the PACES Centers; exchanges of scientific personnel between the FDA and the PACES Centers; and the sharing of collaborative studies, including potential joint manuscripts for publication of findings to benefit the medical and scientific community.  Furthermore, the PACES Centers will be expected to participate in FDA-hosted scientific workshops to develop their plans for CER, and to discuss computational strategies developed and the findings from their analyses. This is a new requirement.

PHASE 2 NRA -NNH08ZEA001N-SSFW1Solicitation Number: NNC10ZCH005RPROGRESSIVE COMPETITION TO CONDUCT ADVANCED VEHICLE CONCEPTS SYSTEM STUDIES FOR SUBSONICCOMMERCIAL TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT ENTERING SERVICE IN THE 2030-2035 PERIOD. PHASE 2 NRA -NNH08ZEA001N-SSFW1NASA is conducting a progressive competition to conduct Advanced Vehicle Concepts SystemStudies for Subsonic Commercial Transport Aircraft Entering Service in the 2030-2035Period. The first phase efforts focused on advanced concepts systems study thatmethodically identifies and evaluates integrated aircraft configurations, and prioritizesthe enabling technologies that will need to be developed to achieve significantbreakthroughs. The second phase will address key technology challenges and to performinitial technology demonstrations that address enabling technology indentified in phase1. The initial phase solicitation was described in the April 15, 2008 posting to FedBizOpps, the NASA Acquisition Internet Service and the NASA Solicitation and Proposal IntegratedReview and Evaluation System (NSPIRES), solicitation number NNH08ZEA001N-SSFW1.  Asstated in the announcements all proposals were submitted electronically using NASAsproposal data system, NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com ), or Grants.gov. The initial (Phase 1) contracts were awarded to: Boeing Company, General ElectricCompany, Northrop Grumman and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on September 29,2008. A progressive competition strategy will be used with down-selection of sources fromthe initial phase to determine the second phase contractors. The competition for thesecond phase will build on the results of the initial phase, and the award criteria forthe second phase includes successful completion of the initial phase requirements.Proposals will be requested from the initial phase contractors by a Letter Request forProposal Submissions.Notwithstanding NASA's expectation that only the Phase 1 contractors will be capable ofsuccessfully competing for Phase 2, all proposals will be considered. Any otherresponsible source may indicate its desire to submit a proposal by responding to thePhase 2 synopsis, and NASA will provide that source all the material furnished to thePhase 1 contractors necessary to submit a proposal. All Phase 2 proposals shall besubmitted electronically using NASAs proposal data system, NSPIRES(http://nspires.nasaprs.com ), or Grants.gov (NSPIRES is NASAs preference for Phase 2proposals).To be considered for Phase 2 award, offerors must demonstrate a design maturityequivalent to that of the Phase 1 contractors.	This demonstration shall include thefollowing Phase 1 deliverables upon which Phase 2 award will be based: 	Development of a credible future scenario within which to describe the challengesthat may be facing commercial aircraft operators in the 2030-35 and beyond timeframe.This scenario establishes a context within which the proposed advanced vehicle concept(s)may meet a market need and enter into service.	An advanced vehicle concept(s) study that will define a vehicle whose missioncapabilities would enable it to fill a broad, primary need in the 2030-35 and beyondtimeframe. See Statement of Work for additional requirements regarding the concept study. 	A prioritized suite of enabling technologies and corresponding technologydevelopment roadmaps required to realize the proposed advanced vehicle concept(s) by the2030-35 timeframeFailure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity mayrender the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.The principal elements considered in evaluating the Phase 2 proposal are its relevance toNASAs objectives, technical merit, effectiveness of the proposed work plan (includingcost), and proposed team qualifications. Failure of a proposal to be highly rated in anyone of the following elements is sufficient cause for the proposal to not be selected. 1. Relevance (weight 20%): 	Evaluation of a proposal's relevance to NASA's objectives includes theconsideration of the potential contribution of the effort to the specific objectives andgoals given in the solicitation to which the proposal is submitted. 	The evaluation process will also consider the importance of the work to theprimary project objectives of advancing knowledge and understanding of the fundamentalprinciples of flight unique to subsonic flights. 2. Technical Merit (weight 35%): 	Overall scientific or technical merit of the proposal, including unique andinnovative methods, approaches, or concepts. 	Evaluation will also include: credibility of technical approach, including aclear assessment of primary risks and a means to address them; proposers capabilities,related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which areintegral factors for achieving the proposal's objectives; and qualifications,capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, or keypersonnel critical in achieving the proposal objectives. 	The selection process will also assess the proposal against the state-of-the-art.3. Effectiveness of the Proposed Work Plan (weight, 20%): 	Comprehensiveness of work plan, effective use of resources, cost, managementapproach, and proposed schedule for meeting the objectives. 	Objectives with measurable metrics toward achieving the proposers goal must beprovided, with a minimum of one metric per year. 	Annual oral presentations made as part of an open Technical Exchange Meeting forpurposes of technology transfer and knowledge dissemination will be expected. 	Documentation of approach and results in the form of final written technicalreports is required. 	A clear statement of what intellectual property is expected to be publiclyavailable at the conclusion of the work is required. It is our intent to share allknowledge developed under this solicitation, thus, any restrictions to that objectivewill cause a lower score in this area. 	Collaboration with NASA researchers (including joint use of facilities, sharingof materials, development of computer code modules compatible with NASAs software, andsynergistic research goals) is desirable, with the objective of enhancing knowledgetransfer and the long-term value of the proposed work.4. Proposed Team Qualifications (weight 25%):	Experience and breadth of the team that is organized to conduct the study	Experience of the team in transport aircraft design 	Ability of the team to offer innovative approaches to address the commercialaviation design requirements of the future.All contractual and technical questions must be submitted to Melissa Merrill in writing(email).

<p>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division - Boulder, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, with the Department of Information Technology, State of New Mexico, for the purchase of preventative and unscheduled maintenance services and tower space for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Radio (NOAA/NWR) All Hazards System transmitters, antennae and transmission lines located at eight (8) AETC owned and operated sites located in New Mexico in Albuquerque, Clovis, Des Moines, Farmington, Hobbs, Las Cruces, Ruidoso, and Santa Fe. The maintenance shall ensure the quality of NWR broadcasts and the issuance of warnings to the listening public within the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) Radio Frequency Authorization (RFA) specifications and Department of Homeland Security requirements for each station. The National Weather Service (NWS) is mandated by the Federal Response Plan to provide uninterrupted Emergency Alert System (EAS) broadcast transmissions 24 hours-per-day, 365 days-per-year.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the Department of Information Technology, State of New Mexico's unique ability to provide maintenance of NWR transmitter systems on a 24-hour, 7 day-a-week basis due to their unlimited access to the tower and transmitter equipment. This unlimited access is required in order to implement routine and unscheduled emergency maintenance as necessary to maintain uninterrupted service to the public. The Department of Information Technology, State of New Mexico towers have accessibility restrictions in regards to Homeland Security. Their FCC license for broadcast television systems mandates the sites remain secure and therefore the Department of Information Technology, State of New Mexico does not allow other vendors unlimited access to them. Maintenance of NWR transmitter systems require 24-hour access to the tower and transmitter equipment in order to implement routine and unscheduled emergency maintenance as necessary to maintain uninterrupted service to the public. In addition, all Department of Information Technology, State of New Mexico maintenance personnel that perform routine and corrective maintenance on the NWR transmitter system have appropriate technical qualifications, training, and experience to perform the required work on the NWS high power radio frequency (RF) VHF FM transmitter systems. Department of Information Technology, State of New Mexico technical representatives are equipped with a full complement of NWR test equipment that is calibrated according to NWS specifications to assure accurateness in all NWR measurements. All maintenance personnel must meet NWS qualifications by appropriate schooling in electronics and associated theory, and specific training provided by the Government in the maintenance of its NWR transmitter equipment. No other sources appear to be technically capable of maintaining the NWR equipment at the subject state of New Mexico sites. It must therefore be concluded that the only source capable of maintaining the NWR equipment is the Department of Information Technology, State of New Mexico.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract will be for a period of 60 months which includes a base year, and four (4) one-year option periods. The base period will run from April 1, 2010 through March 31. 2011. The option periods will run from April 1, 2011 through March 31, 2015. This requirement is a follow-on contract to RA133W05CN1004 with Department of Information Technology, State of New Mexico. The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 811213 and the small business size standard is $7.0 million dollars.</p>
<p>Background: In a January 1975 White House Policy Statement, NOAA's NWR was designated the sole Government-operated radio alert system to provide direct warnings into private homes for both natural disasters and nuclear attack. The mandate required uninterrupted transmission capability 24 hours-per-day, 365 days-per-year. Since 1978, the Department of Information Technology, State of New Mexico has had access to NWR service through successive contracts between the NOAA/NWS and the Department of Information Technology, State of New Mexico. To satisfactorily perform this mandate in the state of New Mexico, the NWS strategically located NWR transmitter stations at eight (8) Department of Information Technology, State of New Mexico sites at Albuquerque, Clovis, Des Moines, Farmington, Hobbs, Las Cruces, Ruidoso, and Santa Fe. The NWR Program remains a prime entry point in the Emergency Alert System (EAS) along with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The critical function of the NWR system is to activate the EAS. This is expected to continue indefinitely especially with the FEMA deployment of the ALL-Hazards Emergency Message Collection System (HazCollect). The HazCollect System will allow emergency management agencies and partners of the NWS to generate Non-Weather Emergency Messages (NWEMS) for automatic distribution through NWS Dissemination Systems. The NWR is also one of the NWS's primary means of disseminating weather forecasts and warnings.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe that they can provide services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation within 30 days after publication of this synopsis by emailing their capability statement to Contract Specialist Susan Labovitz at Susan.Labovitz@noaa.gov. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Services (PBS), Region 2 intends to issue a sole source extension in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for a performance period of four to six months beginning on March 1, 2010.&nbsp; The current contract, set to expire February 28, 2010, provides mechanical maintenance services for the Federal Building at 201 Varick Street, New York, NY 10014. GSA has started the process of soliciting for the follow-on contract, but has required significant changes to the performance scope of work and the building systems inventory. As a result, there is insufficient time for GSA to otherwise immediately procure these services without encountering a lapse and/or impairment of services.&nbsp; Therefore, this sole source extension is necessary to bridge the gap between the current contract and the new award, thereby ensuring the uninterrupted provision of services required for the achievement of a smooth transition and continuous high-level service.<br /><br />Description of the work to be performed: The contractor is to furnish all material, labor, equipment, supervision and services necessary to perform full mechanical maintenance services for a period of four to six months for the Federal Building at 201 Varick Street.&nbsp; The contractor will be responsible for performing all services in accordance with the existing performance scope of work.<br /><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, " Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."<br /><br />This extension is issued to facilitate continuation of services. A lapse in service will have a highly detrimental effect on the ability of the tenant agencies to fulfill their missions and provide necessary services to the public. This extension will provide for the provision of these services at the facility by a firm that holds current security clearances and that is also familiar with the complexity of the facility and the equipment. LCOR is the incumbent contractor and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional six-month period.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a requrest for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued. However, if a firm believes it can meet these requiremets within the prescribed time frame, it may give notification via e-mail to James Smith, Contract Officer, at <a href="mailto:JamesK.Smith@gsa.gov">JamesK.Smith@gsa.gov</a> no later than February 12, 2010, 3:00 P.M., EST. The Government will review all responses, without prejudice; however, the Government reserves the right to render a final determination on a contractor's suitability for this requirement.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D MAINTENANCE SERVICES, INC., W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0038, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Black Warrior and Tombigbee Waterway and Alabama River System, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work to: De-water, clean, inspect, and repair Holt and Oliver Locks.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes making necessary repairs to steel, concrete, seals, cathodic systems, and hydraulic systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated in the existing contract.  <BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs to de-water the structures.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  3)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  Miter gates weighing up to 365 tons may require disconnection from anchorage and jacking for repair.  Miter gates may also require specialized alignment for positioning; removal and installation of contact blocks; stressing of steel diagonals; and line bores of up to 13 inch diameter for gudgeon and anchor pin replacement.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written (formal) solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), solicitation number FA7000-10-T-0022, in accordance with FAR Parts 12 &amp; 13. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-38, 10 December 2009. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423430 and the size standard is 100 employees. This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. All responsible sources may submit a quote, which if received timely, will be considered by the 10th Contracting Squadron, USAF Academy (USAFA).
<p>Please read and comply with all requirements for submitting a quote. Failure to comply with all instructions contained within this combined synopsis/solicitation could result in the quote being ineligible for award. It is the offeror's responsibility to ensure their quote meets all the requirements identified herein.</p>
<p>The USAF Academy has a Brand Name Only requirement to purchase HP Virtual Storage Appliance Software. HP Virtual SAN Servers have been approved by the 10th Communications Squadron as a standard across the USAFA .mil network. Per AFNetOps Functional Concepts, para 6.5, "Standardization of configurations, processes, and applications across the enterprise, from the gateway to the desktop, will facilitate centralized management, enhance security through configuration control, and save manpower in certification and accreditation, patch implementation, hardware/software upgrades, and asset tracking." Also per para 6.1 "Robust, redundant data paths and nodes with both physical and logical diversity are needed to maximize effectiveness and eliminate single points of failure. This will enable the integration of distributed capabilities, improve real-time detection/correlation of network anomalies, and give the AFNetOps Commander a comprehensive picture of any potential network degradation, outage, or attack. As importantly, it will help the NetOps community better understand the impact of network actions and the war-fighting operations that rely on their support."</p>
<p>This guidance lends itself to procuring, configuring and maintaining one standard platform per network that can be cannibalized if necessary, switched out with no impacts and easily repaired physically or remotely when needed. To provide superior quality and a more secure IT environment, it is crucial to retain HP continuity in the USAFA network environment that saves thousands of annual maintenance dollars.</p>
<p>If an offeror believes they have an equal product which meets all the features and functionality of the items listed above, they may submit a quote for that product. It will be evaluated for technical acceptability. If it is determined by the Government to be an equal product, it will be evaluated along with all other technically acceptable offers. If it is determined by the Government not to be an equal product, the offer will not be considered for award.

The full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this address: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/. <br />USAFA 5352.242-9000, Contractor Access to Air Force Installations (Aug 2007) (USAFA Supplemented Jul 08) <br />(a) Per Air Force requirements, the contractor shall obtain base identification for all contractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation. ADDED: All contractor employees shall comply with United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) security requirements while on the installation. USAFA security needs are supported by both military personnel and contractor employees.<br />(1) Added: At the USAFA, contractor personnel are required to obtain Contractor Access Badges (CABs). CABs are only applicable to contractor employees performing duties requiring weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days. If required access is less than 7 days, the process to obtain access is via application for an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. Both CABs and Visitor Passes are issued at the Pass and Registration Center (PRC) located at the south entrance to the USAFA.<br />(2) Added: All references to contractor in this clause include the prime contractor and all subcontractors.<br />(3) Added: Vehicle Usage<br />(i) Contractor vehicles delivering food or water onto the installation are subject to inspection at entry control points. Vehicles making food and water deliveries on the installation will secure their vehicles when not attended to prevent unauthorized access and potential tampering. Vehicles making deliveries off the installation prior to arriving at the USAFA will ensure delivery vehicles remain locked when not attended. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in termination of vehicle access privileges. <br />(ii) Contractors filling water trucks on the installation are only authorized to fill trucks from the non-potable hydrant outside Bldg 8034 and non-potable reservoir #3. The approved potable location is from the hydrant south of Bldg 8124, Snow Barn. Exceptions to these locations can be approved by 10 CES after coordination with 10 SFS. Any location where contractors are filling water trucks will have a back-flow preventor installed.<br />(4) Added: Security Requirements. The contractor shall adhere to the installation security requirements as provided for in AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management, USAFA supplement Chapter 2,Para 2.3 and 2.4; Chapter 7, Para 7.3; and Chapter 8) AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism (AT) Standards (Paragraphs 2.22, Atch 3), DoDI 2000.16, Department of Defense Antiterrorism Standards, Paragraphs E3.18 and E3.25). <br />(i) Antiterrorism (AT). During increased Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs), entry requirements to the installation may change with little to no notice. During FPCON Charlie, contractors without a "C" on their CAB may be denied access. Depending on the incident or threat, all personnel to include contractors may be denied access to the installation for safety/security reasons.<br />(I) Contractors are subject to spot checks or inspections of their vehicles and personal items at entry control points or facility access points during higher threats or during random antiterrorism measure checks. Failure to comply with these added security measures may result in denial of access to the installation.<br />(II) Contractors are encouraged to receive Antiterrorism Awareness Training annually available at no cost, but it is not required in CONUS. Installation, Mission Element or the Unit Antiterrorism Representative (ATR) can provide this training when requested. Contractors can play an important role in protecting the installation and are encouraged to report suspicious activity to Security Forces by either calling 911 during emergencies or 333-2000.<br />(ii) Operations Security (OPSEC): As applicable based on the scope and nature of the contract, the contractor shall comply with Government OPSEC guidance and training as prescribed in AFI 10-701, Operations Security, Chapter 4, paragraph 4.1 and AFI 33-332, Privacy Act, for handling of For Official Use Only (FOUO) information and HQ 10 ABW/CC Memorandum, USAFA Operations Security (OPSEC) Policy. Government provided OPSEC training is offered at no charge to the contractor. The contractor shall notify the applicable Unit OPSEC representative of the using activity receiving the contracted support, within one business day upon the discovery of any OPSEC violations<br />(iii) Communications Security (COMSEC): The contractor shall comply with Government COMSEC requirements as contained in AFI 33-201V2, Communications Security, user requirements and USAFA COMSEC Manager guidance/directives. <br />(5) Added: Prior to contractor employees providing services on the installation under this contract, the contractor shall validate that all contractor employees performing services on the installation are United States citizen or hold a valid resident alien status providing proof of alien registration with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service.<br />(i) Background Checks. Prior to contractor personnel working on USAFA installation properties, the contractor shall agree that USAFA Security Forces may conduct a criminal history check, as applicable, on any or all employees performing on this contract. Criminal history checks may include accessing the appropriate state crime information center and national crime information center database to include, but not limited to, any state listed by the employee as current and past addresses. If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check. Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract. In addition, any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years shall also constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to restrict or immediately remove employees from effort under this contract. <br />(I) Applicable convictions include: Murder; Assault with intent to commit murder; Espionage; Sedition (Conspiracy); Kidnapping or hostage taking; Treason; Rape or aggravated sexual abuse; Unlawful possession, use, sale, distribution, or manufacture of an explosive or weapon; Extortion; Distribution or intent to distribute a controlled substance; Illegal possession of a controlled substance; and Any felony conviction involving: Armed or unarmed robbery, Arson, Acts involving a threat, Willful destruction of property, Importation or manufacture of a controlled substance, Burglary or theft, Dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation, Possession or distribution of stolen property, Aggravated assault, Bribery, Violence at international airports (18 USC 37), or Conspiracy or attempt to commit any of the criminal acts listed above or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws. <br />(II) Actions that involve restrictions or removal do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(iii) Warrants. If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract. The contractor shall submit a USAFA Form 111 on each contractor employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract. All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass and Registration Center (PRC). CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days. If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract. The letter shall contain the names(s) of the individuals(s) with their social security numbers. The CO will endorse the letter and forward it to PRC. The contractors shall collect CABs and return them to the PRC within 5 days.<br />(3) Added: At the end of each performance period (i.e. options) and at the expiration of the contract, the contractor shall submit a letter to the CO containing the number of badges issued on each contract, the names of the individuals with their social security numbers, and identify those badges being returned. The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111. The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>BACKGROUND 

The General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Acquisition Service, Office of Travel, Motor Vehicle and Card Services, Office of Travel and Transportation Services (T&T), continues to implement the E-Gov Travel Service and provide related improvements to various travel and transportation programs and services.  The purpose of this contract is to obtain strategic initiatives management support services for the next generation of E-Gov Travel.

PURPOSE

The Obama Administration is encouraging Agencies to adopt an "Open Innovation Strategy" to solve complex business problems. The goal for the following E-Gov Travel Service (ETS) effort is to enhance business travel for the Government traveler and reduce the administrative and cost overhead burdens associated with the service.  As a continuing part of our market research effort for developing solutions to the follow on contract for ETS, we wish to implement an Open Innovation Strategy. The outcome of this effort would shorten innovation cycles, involve our customers, introduce out-of-the-box thinking (or challenge the ‘dominant logic’), increase customer loyalty, and get access to exclusive knowledge and creativity. Open Innovation has hyping potential because Open Innovation activities serve the organization in several ways: (1) it leads to new innovations, (2) it represents the company and its proposition to the outside world, (3) it empowers internal resources, and (4) it fulfills the increasing need that end users have on the services paid for. 

Scope 

The GSA requires strategic initiatives management support services using an open innovation strategy.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing all labor, resources, management, and oversight to accomplish the effort herein.

<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number RA1341-10-RQ-0301DR.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The associated NAICS code is 541690. The small business size standard is $7.0 M.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item:<br />CLIN # 0001 Services, non-personal, to provide all equipment, labor and materials (unless otherwise provided herein) necessary for Measurement of Diffusible Hydrogen in Steel Specimens in accordance with attached Statement of Work. Quantity one (1) JB.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>Statement of Work <br />Measurement of diffusible hydrogen in steel specimens</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Materials Reliability Division of NIST has installed a new chamber that can test the mechanical properties of tensile specimens in a high pressure hydrogen environment (up to 140 MPa). The growing interest in the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel is driving the need for data on materials that might be used to construct high-pressure hydrogen pipelines. While the lower strength pipeline steels are expected to be more resistant to hydrogen damage, our initial studies are with a high- strength grade, specifically API 5L-X 100 pipeline steel, which should more clearly reveal the effect of hydrogen on the tensile and fatigue strengths. The government is seeking a contractor to measure the levels of diffusible hydrogen within the specimens during tensile and fatigue testing in this chamber. The chamber has several electrical feedthroughs that could be used to transmit signals from some hydrogen detector to a remote data collection and acquisition system.</p>
<p>Calibration</p>
<p>Hydrogen calibration of X100 steel in tensile testing arragement</p>
<p>Test plan</p>
<p>The government requires hydrogen assessment of six (6) specimens , which are arranged in a test matrix to reveal the effect of different rates and levels of hydrogen charging. All specimens will be tested in the chamber. The first specimen will be tested at ambient pressure in air, and is expected to show us the background hydrogen level in the steel. The second one will be tested in helium pressurized to 2000 PSI, and is expected to demonstrate the effect of pressure on the test fixture and the sensor system, although the hydrogen level is expected to remain low. The third and fourth specimens are replicates with palladium coatings tested in 2000 PSI hydrogen pressure, and are expected to show us the reproducibility of the test method. The fifth and six specimens are replicates with no coating tested in 2000 PSI hydrogen pressure, and are expected to measure the effect of a palladium coating on hydrogen entry into the specimens.</p>
<p>The government requires the contractor to furnish six (6) sensors that will be mounted on the tensile specimens, and can fit within the 100 mm diameter chamber. The sensor will be attached to the ASTM E8 tensile specimens that have a diameter of 6 mm and gauge length of 25 mm. The tensile specimens will have two clip gages in the center region to measure the elongation of the specimen, so the hydrogen sensor must mount on the surface of the specimen either outside or within the gauge instrumentation, so as not to interfere with the elongation measurement. The contractor will furnish sensors, attach the sensors to the internal feedthroughs on the chamber, attach vendor-supplied data collection system to the external feedthroughs, be available and present to collect this data during our testing times, and provide calibrated data on the hydrogen content during the charging and testing of the six specimens (probably in the low ppm range).<br />NIST will furnish small pieces of the API 5L-X100 steel, so that the contractor can develop preliminary calibrations and check the operation of the sensor.</p>
<p><br />C&amp;A requirements of clause 73 do not apply. A security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>(VII) Required delivery 45 days ARO. Place of delivery is 325 Broadway, Building 22, Boulder, CO 80305-3328. Delivery shall be FOB Destination, quote shall include all shipping charges, if applicable.</p>
<p>(VIII) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (JUN 2009), applies to this acquisition. In addition to written price quotes, offers are instructed to complete and return the attached SF-18.</p>
<p>(IX) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999), applies to this acquisition. Paragraph (a) is hereby completed as follows: the Government will award a firm fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: a) technical experience-offers shall submit resumes of personal with at least two years of experience that will be working on this purchase order b) delivery-offers must state delivery time; c) price and d) past performance - offers should include two references that can be contacted.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-38.  This action is set-aside for small businesses, NAICS 454312, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Bottled Gas) Dealers, with a small business size standard of 50 employees.  The National Park Service (NPS) encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.  The Government intends to issue a requirements contract to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous for the Government, price and other factors considered.  We reserve the right to cancel this solicitation.
BACKGROUNDThe NPS owns and operates numerous buildings and facilities in Stehekin, Washington, including offices, warehouses, and employee housing, many of which use propane for heating and/or cooking.  We have an ongoing need for propane deliveries, particularly during the winter months.  This solicitation will lead to an indefinite delivery requirements contract for propane to be delivered for up to five years (awarded as a base year plus four option years).  An estimated target price and estimated quantity will be stated for each year, with both allowed to fluctuate during the contract period.  The total contract price for the five years is expected to be <$100,000 and the total quantity delivered per year is estimated to be between 8,000 and 11,000 gallons.  
LOCATIONStehekin is located at the head of Lake Chelan, 55 miles from the town of Chelan, WA, within Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.  Maps, description, accommodations, and services may be viewed at www.nps.gov/lach or http://www.nps.gov/archive/noca/focus/focus.htm or http://www.stehekinvalley.com/.  The only access is by public passenger-only ferry, barge, private vessel, or float plane from Chelan.  Contractors are advised that barges run infrequently and it is recommended that Contractors verify scheduled runs and costs, or cost of charter runs, with the barge company before submitting an offer.   The propane tanks to be serviced in this contract are within three miles of the boat/barge landing.
STATEMENT OF WORKThe work to be performed under this contract consists of delivering liquid propane gas (LPG) to specified tanks in the Stehekin valley in accordance with federal, state, and county regulations and the following specifications.  Propane tanks to be filled under contract are at the Imus, Hilton, Lief, and Wilsey houses, the maintenance yard, the Golden West visitor center, and the wastewater treatment plant.  All tanks are NPS-owned 500-gallon except for the 1000-gallon tank at the Golden West Visitor Center.  The delivery locations will likely vary through time and may be unilaterally adjusted at any time during the contract period by written notification from the Contracting Officer (CO) or their Representative (COR) to the Contractor.
Contractor shall deliver propane to each tank at least once per month.  Monthly delivery amounts will be to "top off" each tank (specified above) to at least 70% full.  Delivery shall take place during regular business hours (8:00 am-4:30 pm, Monday through Friday) and should be coordinated with the Stehekin Maintenance Foreman or designee, who will inspect the service and confirm the delivered amount. Delivery shall be accomplished in a safe manner, in accordance with the regulations listed below, and without damage to National Park Service or other property.  
NPS staff will monitor the LPG level in each tank listed above.  If propane level falls below 30% at any tank between monthly deliveries, NPS staff will notify contractor who will schedule an additional LPG delivery as soon as possible.
Occasionally, NPS will bring small, portable tanks to the contractor's facility to be filled.  
APPLICABLE REGULATIONSShipping and transfer of flammable gases are regulated by the Washington State Department of Transportation and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.  Specific licensing and permit requirements are codified in CFR, Title 49, Parts 100-177 and Parts 383-399 as well as elsewhere.  The regulations pertain to the loading and unloading of flammable gas, accidents, inspections, certification of operators, drug testing, and other safety aspects of the transfer operation; it is the contractor's sole responsibility to research and comply with all pertinent regulations.  The offeror shall furnish the Contracting Officer acceptable evidence showing that required licenses and certifications have been obtained, including drivers' commercial driver's licenses with hazardous materials endorsement.  After award, if there is a change in Contractor's personnel, the Contractor shall furnish evidence that the new employees meet these requirements.
INVOICING AND PAYMENTContractor shall prepare and submit invoices monthly.  Each itemized invoice shall identify the date, location, quantity, and current price for each delivery, as well as the invoice total.  Payment will be by electronic funds transfer to the bank account identified in the vendor's CCR record.  Terms are net 30 days, unless a prompt payment discount is offered and accepted.
The price charged to the government shall be the same or lower than the bulk price charged to the contractor's other customers for deliveries in the same time period.  Because the cost of propane varies considerably, the price of propane delivered under this contract may fluctuate, upward or downward.  If the price change is within 10% of the target estimated price for each year, no formal notification or contract modification is required.  If, however, the price increases by more than 10% from the target, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing before any monthly deliveries are made at the higher price.  The contractor may charge a fixed per-gallon delivery fee above the bulk price; this fee shall be stated in the offer for each contract year.  
PRICE SCHEDULEFor each year, include a target price (per gallon, delivered) and any associated delivery fee (per gallon).  The estimated quantity for each year is 9,500 gallons.  The contract years are as follows:Base year (date of award to October 31, 2010) Option Year 1 (November 1, 2010 to October 31, 2011)Option Year 2 (November 1, 2011 to October 31, 2012)Option Year 3 (November 1, 2012 to October 31, 2013)Option Year 4 (November 1, 2013 to October 31, 2014)
EVALUATION FACTORSOffers received by the Government will be evaluated according to the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance.  Technical and past performance factors, when combined, are less important than price.  NPS will select the offer that represents the best overall value to the government.  Refer to FAR clause 52.212-2.1)	PRICE.2)	TECHNICAL:  How well the product matches the stated requirements and whether the contractor's required licenses and certifications are proper and current. 3)	PAST PERFORMANCE:  Past performance records of the offering vendor, including whether they are capable, efficient, effective; and their performance conformed to contract specifications (quality); if they are reasonable, cooperative, and committed to customer satisfaction (business relations).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

Revised Statement of Work
Technical Writing Services
1.0	Introduction
1.1	Background

The Critical Path Initiative is the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) effort to stimulate and facilitate a national effort to modernize the scientific process through which a potential human drug, biological product, or medical device is transformed from a discovery or “proof of concept” into a medical product.  One scientific hurdle on the Critical Path is a lack of understanding of the mechanistic and genetic basis of extremely rare, but serious adverse drug reactions. These reactions, such as drug-induced liver injury, may affect only one patient in several thousand.  The scientific challenge is to discover and validate biomarkers that can identify individuals who are at high risk of developing serious adverse events (SAEs).  This knowledge would lay the scientific groundwork for the development of personalized approaches to treatment that would enhance the safety of drugs by identifying individuals susceptible to specific adverse drug reactions.

The International Serious Adverse Events Consortium (iSAEC) is a non-profit consortium actively engaged in research to identify and validate DNA-variants useful in predicting the risk of drug-induced serious adverse events.  The rarity of drug induced serious adverse events and the absence of efficient surveillance/research networks, makes it extremely difficult for any one company/research entity to accrue enough SAE cases and controls to conduct effective whole genome studies and follow on hypothesis driven molecular research.  To date, the iSAEC has partnered with “academic investigators” to build a variety of SAE “research cohorts”.  To obtain the research subjects for SAE research in the scale and diversity required, new collaborations with large integrated researcher groups and health networks (with electronic health records) will need to be developed.  In order to expand SAE research in this direction, standardized phenotypes and assessment methods must be developed and published.  To date, the published literature is variable on such definitions and assessment models.
 		
The FDA is co-sponsoring an international conference, to be held in the spring of 2010, to standardize the case definitions of three serious drug-related adverse events, serious skin rash (SSR)/acute hypersensitivity syndrome (AHSS), drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and Long Q-T (LQT)/Torsades de Pointes (TdP).  The result of this conference will be standard phenotypic definitions for each of these adverse events which can then be adopted and widely used by the clinical/scientific/biomedical research communities to better standardize research into the genetic basis of SAEs.  The technical writing group will work with three Expert Working Groups (EWG) to develop technical documents, scholarly articles and decision trees which describe the standard phenotypic definitions for each of the SAEs.
1.2	Objective
The principle objective is to provide medical writing services to the Office of Translational Sciences (OTS) within the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), to develop a published set of standard phenotypic definitions and associated diagnostic criteria to characterize the clinical features required for the identification of subjects with the following SAEs: Serious skin Rash (SSR)/Acute Hypersensitivity Syndrome (AHSS), Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI), and LQT/Torsades de Pointes (TdP) that will be addressed during the Phenotype standardization project consensus conference . 

1.2.1	The purpose of this procurement is to develop, (a) common formatting for serious drug-related adverse event case definitions, (b) technical documents with detailed diagnostic criteria, and (c) targeted acceptable, which adheres to publishing house standards for each journal and additional information as required for publication in relevant journals. Examples include the New England Journal of Medicine, the American Journal of Cardiology, and the American Journal of Clinical Dermatology; or journals that describe the phenotype standards for each of three (3) serious adverse drug reactions:  
•	Serious Skin Rash (SSR)/Acute Hypersensitivity Syndrome (AHSS)
•	Drug–induced Liver Injury (DILI)
•	LQT/Torsades de Pointes (TdP)

1.2.1.1	Develop algorithm outlining the clinical diagnostic criteria to aid in phenotyping each SAEs identified in Section 1.2
1.2.1.2	Assist the three (3) expert working groups (EWGs), comprised of 4-5 disease experts with representation from the international regulatory agencies European Medicines Association (EMEA) and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW), in developing a common framework for the SAE phenotype definitions and writing draft phenotype definitions for each of the 3 SAE areas described in 1.2.1 prior to the conference in spring 2010.

1.3.3	Participate by teleconference in seven 2-hour meetings in the EWG meetings to provide working draft phenotype documents for each of the 3 SAE areas prior to the conference, which is based on input from the working group and additional background and reference materials provided by the EWGs 
1.3.4	Travel to and attend the 1-day conference, to be held at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, Cambridge, UK in late Spring 2010 (date to be determined) in order to interact with conference participants to accurately capture the main conference conclusions. 
1.3.5	Develop (3) 15-20 page technical documents, based on the results of the conference which contain a detailed background, case definition and other information for each of the 3 SAEs specified in section 1.2.1.
1.3.6	Develop a decision algorithm for each of the SAEs specified in section 1.2.1.
1.3.7	Develop three (3) targeted, 3-5 page manuscripts, for each adverse drug reaction specified in section 1.2.1, based on the technical documents, but in accordance with publishing guidelines for each relevant journal for publication in journals as specified in section 1.2.1,  that describe the phenotype standards for each of three (3) serious adverse drug reactions.

Each contractor will be evaluated on the capability and qualifications of staff for the performance of tasks listed in the SOW. Offerors must identify in-house or team staff and describe their capabilities and expertise in substantive areas related to activities described in the SOW. The Offerors shall demonstrate the qualifications, education, and experience of the proposed medical writer. Resumes or CVs should be submitted.


Price Evaluation

If the technical proposals are essentially equal or are approximately equal in the technical ability, then the award may be made on the basis of lowest cost.  Additionally, cost would be evaluated on the basis of its realism and acceptability.

 
ATTACHMENT B

Question:  Could you possibly extend the deadline for submitting proposals? The solicitation was posted on FedBizOpps on January 15. The due date is only two business days later (when taking into consideration the Martin Luther King Day holiday). It is not possible for companies--especially small businesses--to produce credible proposals that quickly. Based on our past experience, a response time of at least two weeks is typical for solicitations like yours. 
Response:	The deadline is extended to February 19, 2010; see Modification Three (3).   
Question:	Is a contracting company currently supplying the services mentioned in the Statement of Work or has such a company done so in the last 12 months? If so, what is the name of the company? 
Response:	There are no incumbent currently providing theses services.
Question:	Is it correct to assume that you would expect 3 separate subject matter expert writers, one each to focus on each of the 3 serious adverse drug reactions or is the program office anticipating that the writing group meetings and deadlines will not conflict and one medical writer can perform all the writing? 
Response:	Only one writer is required.

Question:	If different writers, can we assume that they all three would travel to the UK to be able to focus on the different areas? 

Response:	 See response to question above.


Question:	Should we estimate travel costs to include 1 or 2 conference days? The RFQ
states 1-2 days on page 3 and 1 day in the Task Deliverables on page 4.

       Response: Travel cost not –to- exceed $7,500.00

Question: 	On page 3, under Project Scope, it requests participation in seven 2 hour meetings in the EWG meetings.  Do we interpret that to mean seven meetings for each of the 3 SAE areas for a total of 21 two hour sessions or one writer for only seven meetings?

Response:	See revised statement of work.


Question:	This FAR Part 13 acquisition is stated as being conducted in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6.  However, it is not clear whether FAR 13.5 is, or is not, applicable.  In other words, is the acquisition above the $100,000 simplified acquisition threshold?

Response:	No, Far Part 13.5 is not applicable to this requirement.

     
Question:	The synopsis makes reference to a “project manager and medical writer”, but it is not clear whether the project team is to consist of just these two staff members or what the role of the project manager is with respect to meetings and travel to the UK.  There does not seem to be any provision for backup staff in case the sole medical writer becomes unavailable due to health or other reasons.

Response:	Only one writer is required.

Question:	The synopsis states that the agency intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract.  However, the description in the notice/solicitation contains statements/requirements that are either not appropriate to fixed price.

Response:	See revised statement of work.
	 	
Question:	Why is contra actor required to “adhere to standard work hours, working no more than 40 hours per week and observe all U.S. Government holidays.”  Is this consistent with travel to the UK? 
 
Response:	Only one writer is required.

Question:	Contractor is required to conform to applicable laws, regulations, policies, and standards but they are not identified.

Response:	Reference removed in its entirety.


Question:	The combined synopsis/solicitation appears to be a draft; it explicitly states in the text “(how many meetings?)”.  Delivery schedule and deliverables are stated all over the solicitation rather than in a specific section.  See requirements for reports.

Response:	See revised statement of work

Question:	Evaluation criteria do not identify cost as an evaluation factor and fail to state relative value of technical to cost in making award. 

Response: 	See revised evaluation criteria in the statement of work.


Question:	The use of Past Performance as an evaluation factor and the requirement to submit 3 references is not clear with respect to whether they are related to the same or different evaluation areas.  Statements that refer to “offerors” are not correct for a request for quotations.   Offerors that are to be evaluated under “existing and prior contracts for similar products or services” appears inconsistent with the uniqueness of the required services.

Response:	Addressed in the revised evaluation criteria.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br /></strong></span><strong>QUESTION 1:&nbsp;</strong> The Oxford 924 chipset is specified. Would it be acceptable to propose a solution using the Oxford 934 chipset which provides the same function and greater performance?<br /><br /><strong>ANSWER 1:</strong>&nbsp; As long as it meets the needs of the minimum specification (the Oxford 924 chipset), newer technology is acceptable.<br /><strong><br />QUESTION 2:</strong>&nbsp; The solicitation specifies a 3.5" HDD for all capacity models. For the 320GB, 500GB, and 750GB it would be possible to utilize 2.5" HDD's which would result in: (a) a significantly smaller package for those capaciities, while maintaining the same performance, and (b) allow for the unit to be powered by the computer or laptop without the need for an external power supply. Would such a solution be acceptable/desireable?<br /><strong><br />ANSWER 2:</strong>&nbsp;  The 3.5" HDD is the industry standard enclosure size. One of the benefits of having a consistent size is the ability to stack multiple drives. This proposed solution is not acceptable or desirable.<br /><strong><br />QUESTION 3:</strong>&nbsp; The current solicitation specifies USB 2.0 and USB 1.1. Would a solution with USB 3.0 be acceptable? USB 3.0 provides a 300% improvement in data transfer rate and is also backwards compatible with USB 1.1 and USB 2.0.<br /><strong><br />ANSWER 3:&nbsp;</strong> USB 3.0 is acceptable as it is backward compatible with USB 2.0 and 1.1, but please keep in mind that all external hard drives must have a quad interface capability (USB, ESATA, FireWire400 and FireWire800).<br /><br /> <br /><br />_____________________________________________________________________<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

Therefore, NASA is issuing this modification to the RFI to requestinformation from the launch service providers that can be shared publicly.  The information that is submitted in response to this modified request will be madeavailable to the public, including the research and development community and theeducation community at large, so that NASA can solicit research proposals in a fair andopen process.NASA intends to post the information submitted in response to this modified request onthe following or similar NASA websites:	http://suborbitalex.arc.nasa.gov/NASA will list the information by company, with dates that commercial launch services areanticipated to be available. The CRuSR program office also plans to use this informationin presentations to the public as it builds interest in educational and researchopportunities.	NASA realizes that precise data will not be available until many test flights arecompleted, so conservative estimates are acceptable.  NASA also understands that industrycapabilities, and the fidelity of the vehicle environmental data, will improve over time. Please provide revised data as it becomes available so that it can be widely shared withthe research community.  To facilitate this process, please provide specific informationas shown in the following list.  Any information that is not provided can be listed asnot provided or proprietary, as specified in the response.	Please provide separate information for each vehicle as necessary.A.

<p>2. What experience do you have in providing residential reentry services?</p>
<p>3. Are there any other residential reentry center facilities in the area?</p>
<p>4. Are there any state or local ordinances/restrictions that would prohibit or that would considerably slow down the procurement process, (i.e. building permits or leasing/rental agreements)?</p>
<p>5. Are there any known local area concerns? Do you think the area would be supportive of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) program? Are there any known groups or organizations that would oppose the operation of a residential (halfway) house in this area?</p>

<p>10. Are there any zoning issues that prohibit or would slow down the procurement process?</p>
<p>11. Is local or public transportation available in this area? If not, is there an alternative method of transportation for inmates to get to and from work or get to and from their programming appointments?</p>
<p>12. Is the location conducive of the BOP requirement for inmates finding jobs within 21 days of placement?</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 813920   The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers in response to questions received regarding the RFQ.
Question #1:What is the period of performance for the accreditation? The requirements imply activities related to having the laboratories achieve accreditation to ISO 17025. What about maintaining the accredited status?
Answer:From the text in the RFQ, Performance Objective 6 states that the contractor shall provide all accreditation activities during the initial accreditation cycle. The accreditation cycle length and requirements will be defined by the accreditation body's policies and procedures. The scope of the RFQ includes the initial accreditation and any maintenance required to complete the initial cycle. Any additional maintenance or recurring fees required for renewal of accreditation should not be included.
Question #2:Performance objective 7 relates to training but does not specify the type of training requested.  Is what is envisioned a one day session on 17025, or does it include more in-depth quality system and technical area training such as internal auditing and measurement uncertainty?
Answer:The intent of the training Performance Object is not an in-depth, multi-course training program, but a one time pre-assessment training where the Accrediting Body would be responsible for educating the laboratory staff members that may not have had much exposure to ISO 17025. The training should be made available to all laboratory staff members and should take place prior to the assessment, focusing on what the assessment requirements are.
The Performance Work Statement and Evaluation Factors may be accessed at http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/1000083/index.htm. Quotes are due on Thursday, February 11 at 2:00 p.m. EST. Quotes shall be submitted via email to Jennifer Garger, Contract Specialist at garger.jennifer@epa.gov . Quotes shall be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format.

<p>GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Integrated Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation's most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 - 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principals for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). This GSA project has a goal to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating. Projects in or affecting historic properties must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This facility must be designed in metric units. This project will be delivered through the Design-Build delivery method.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project consists of a modernization upgrade project for the Wayne Aspinall Federal Building. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 3 stories above grade and a basement. The building contains 41,562 gross square feet (GSF), 36,907 rentable square feet (RSF), and 24,129 usable square feet (USF). The building will be fully occupied throughout the modernization project. Agencies located in the federal building are the U.S. Senate, General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of Justice Immigration Review (EOIR), Department of Justice U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), Department of Justice U.S. District Courts, Department of Justice Probation, Department of Justice U.S. Attorney's Office, Corps of Engineers (USA COE), Social Security Administration (SSA), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Department of Labor (LD)-Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The building is located at 400 Rood Avenue, Grand Junction, CO 81501. The building is a long-term GSA-held asset situated in a prime location in downtown Grand Junction with public transportation within the central business district. The Wayne Aspinall Federal Building is on the National Historic Register. Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the building's existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. Project goals and objectives are to improve energy efficiency of the building by replacing the mechanical system, upgrading the lighting/controls, upgrades to the domestic and mechanical plumbing systems/restrooms, upgrading accessibility, modernizing/replacing the elevator, replacing the upper and lower roof, upgrades to the interior common/public spaces in accordance with the building's historic aesthetic, upgrading the main lobby in accordance with the building's historic aesthetic, cleaning/restoring the building's exterior, upgrading the building and tenant security, ancillary tenant finish modifications, and compliance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2007 (ARRA) Minimum Performance Criteria.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK Design Stage services and Construction Stage work are to be performed by the DB Contractor. Design Stage services include providing Design Concept and Design Development Phase services. Construction Stage work includes preparing construction documents and performing construction in conformance with the project requirements. The scope of services for the Design Stage will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, landscape architecture, construction phasing planning, BIM coordination, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents. The scope of services for the Construction Stage will require at a minimum: preparation of construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), CPM scheduling, BIM, scope management, value engineering, maintaining construction records, utilizing an electronic project management system in order to manage project documents, monitoring construction costs, commissioning, post-construction contract services (PCCS), demolition, construction, and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government. The Design-Build contractor shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration. Most importantly, the Design-Build contractor shall have complete responsibility for design and construction of the facility, including timely delivery within the project budget.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATEGY The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals (the Short List will be published, however the RFP will NOT be published in FedBizOpps). All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)). In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement. In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304 Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions. The RFQ will be issued electronically after 02/19/2010 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12, an Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard intends to procure blue polo shirts in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW). This proposed procurement is for services/supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis to: Greco Apparel Inc., 420 N Spring Garden St., Ambler, PA 19002
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>1.) The United Coast Guard (USCG) will be purchasing blue polo shirts that will be part of a Coast Guard summer uniform.</p>
<p><br />2.) The USCG began this project by working with Greco Apparel Inc . The USCG bought a small quantity of&nbsp;polo shirts&nbsp;for testing in Florida in 2008, and early 2009. After the wear test, the order was solicited with a Commercial Item Description (CID). The USCG received Product Demonstration Models (PDM's) from several vendors, all of which were unacceptable.</p>
<p>3.) Due to Greco Apparel Inc's previous design of the polo shirts for the wear tests performed in 2008/2009, and the previous solicitations being unsuccessful, Greco is the best option to produce the&nbsp;polo shirts&nbsp;to ensure delivery by summer 2010.</p>
<p><br />Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

This statement should cover all areas outlined in the Source Code Analysis Requirements Description document.
III.	Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement that will be filled under Task 43, of ContractNNG09HP18C (formerly Contract No. NNG09HP08C) for the Hydrospheric and BiosphericSciences (HBS)at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)to create and design a newverison of the LVIS instrument capable of the same level of performance, but modified foroperations in a high-altitude, autonomous environment. The design will be based on theexisting LVIS instrument, and will utilize several componet designs (i.e. the aircraftstructure, the pressure enclosure, and the data system) that were recently developed forthe Cloud Precipitation Lidar (CPL) on the Global Hawk. The new LVIS-GH instrument willincorporate some of the latest in NASA and commercially-developed lasers, detectors,digitizers, and imaging systems resulting in an autonomous, high-altitude, wide-swath,full-waveform laser altimer for use in the NASA Global Hawk aircraft. This effort willprovide the mechancial, electrical, optical, thermal infrastructure and hardware,aircraft mounting structure, and electrical control and data collection system for thisinstrument. This effort will also include the integration of several Government-providedcomponents and subsystems for integration and ground-based testing of the entire systemon the Global Hawk aircraft. This task under the HBS contract will be performed utilizingAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds. &lt;P&gt;NASA/GSFC has awarded task 43 under Contract NNG09HP18C (formerly Contract No.NNG09HP08C) with Sigma Space Corporation.  Contract NNG09HP18C with Sigma SpaceCorporation is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract and was awarded on June 15, 2009, ona competitive basis.  This work could not be performed on a fixed price basis due tovariability of research and projects.

<DESC>Justification for Other ThanFull and Open Competition (JOFOC) DocumentThe following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1"Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" and the Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 806.304.	1.  Agency Identification 	U.S. Department of Veterans AffairsNew Mexico VA Health Care System (501/90C)1501 San Pedro SE  Albuquerque, NM 871082.  Description of Action Being ApprovedThe New Mexico Veterans Health Care System requests the purchase of 40 CADD Solis Infusion systems with supporting software and hardware. The action to be approved is the use of statutory authority (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements) allowing use of other than full and open competition as addressed in FAR Part 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1),  3.  Description  The total expected value of services and equipment is estimated to be $171,400.00 to be       paid in full upon delivery and installation of equipment.   4.  Statutory Authority/Authority Cited  The basis of this JOFOC is the criteria implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." (a) Authority. (1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1). (2) When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.  	5.  Reason for Authority CitedThe reason for citing FAR Part 6.302-1 as the statutory authority for this JOFOC is that it is appropriate in this situation where the agency's needs could only be satisfied by the unique supplies/services available through Smiths Medical INC.  Application. This authority shall be used, (1) when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by- (i) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities; 6.  Demonstrate Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications.  The CADD Solis infusion Pump is an extremely efficient pump that gives the flexibility to use in many different areas of pain management. It can be used in the chronic pain area the acute pain area and in continuing post operative blocks, Intravenous, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, in close proximity to nerves, into an intraoperative site (soft tissue, body cavity/surgical wound site), epidural space, or subarachnoid space infusion. This pump is intended for therapies that require a continuous rate of infusion, patient-controlled demand doses, or both (such as patient-controlled analgesia). This is done by its programmability, its size and its flexible tubing. This is the only pump that can be portable and also deliver the quantity of meds needed to provide patient care for longer intervals. There has been an increase in pain management patients that we are seeing which has left staff unable to deliver the appropriate care at this time. This pump can quickly adjust this situation in all 3 areas of pain relief.  Other benefits of using one the Cadd Solis Pump are that it eliminates the use of other medicine dispensing equipment needed to provide the same care. The number of pumps needed also decreases therefore the storage space needed decreases. Furthermore the training needed is limited to one piece of equipment vs. two or three. Cutting the training time significantly for new personnel and reducing the risk of errors. Repeat use of one specific pump helps to assure familiarity and decreases chance of error. The purchase of 40 Cadd Solis infusion pumps will replace 44 Baxter PCA pumps, 1 APII pump and 5 IPUMPS.The CADD Solis infusion pump is the only one able to cover seven key requirements for pain management care. The seven key requirements below are the most important aspects that a clinical provider is concerned with when using infusion pumps.1 Portable2 easily programmable  3 large reservoirs  4 accepts premade meds  5 accepts narcotics or local anesthetics  6 simple to operate and educate  7 has internal set points that are valuable in acute pain, chronic pain and OR settings7.  Sources Sought Efforts.  The agency has done a market survey using the GSA FSS Schedule Sources, and has searched the FBO database, and CCR database for similar manufactures.  The survey resulted with no positive feedback from other manufacturers that can provide the needed instruments/implants.  A comparison trial was set use to evaluate similar pumps from different manufactures. The manufactures are Baxter and Alaris. The CADD Solis infusion pump was the only pump to meet the above mentioned key requirements. NMVAHCS also intends to release a synopsis of the requirement utilizing FedBizOpps database, IAW FAR Part 5.  8.  Determination of Fair/Reasonable Price.  	Price reasonableness will be established in accordance with FAR 15.402  9. Description of the Market Research Conducted and Results.  The items for this requirement are commercially available to private and public sector but only available from one vendor with (Smiths Medical 1265 Grey Fox Road, St. Paul, MN 55112). Search of both the Vet Biz and CCR site indicated no Veteran business who could provide the services requested. Other companies that were trialed and tested were:BaxterThis company had IV pumps but did not meet all of the requirements outlined in point number 6 above. One Baxter ParkwayDeerfield, IL 60015-4625AlarisThis company had IV pumps but did not meet all of the requirements outlined in point number 6 above.1-888-867-4287Below is a summary table of the results of the trial performed by the Anesthesiology department of the New Mexico Veterans Health Care System.                                            CADD          Alaris          Baxter1] Portable                             yes              no                yes2] Easily Programmable        yes              no                 yes3] Large Reservoir                 yes              yes                yes4] Accepts PremadeMedications                           yes              yes                yes5] Accepts narcoticsor local anesthetics                yes             yes                 yes6] Simple to operateand educate                          yes             yes                 yes7] Has internal set pointsValuable in acute, chronicand OR settings                   yes              no                    noAn intent to sole source with Smiths Medical 1265 Grey Fox Road, St. Paul, MN 55112 will be advertise in the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) 15 days prior to award which invites other interested parties to provide their qualifications or objections to the procurement.  10.

<DESC>This Justification &amp; Approval (J&amp;A) supports a previously awarded Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) sole source purchase order FA8802-10-M-0001 to JDS Uniphase Corporation (JDSU) to procure and store solar array glass for SMC/GPSW space development needs. This action was urgently required to ensure SMC/GPSW development needs are met and to avoid $28M in redevelopment costs due to a diminishing manufacturing source. As an incidental benefit, this procurement will also maintain a coverglass source for US Government programs and preserve National Security Space (NSS) development capabilities for the next 6 years. Under authority of this J&amp;A, SMC/PIK issued a FAR Part 12 Commercial Purchase Order (PO) to enable supply chain ordering of long-lead items to meet a critical production schedule. The contract vehicle was required on/about 4 Dec 2009 for delivery by 26 Feb 2010. Authority was provided by the SMC Competition Advocate on 4 Dec 2009 via email to pursue this single source action as unusual and compelling urgency and complete this J&amp;A after the fact.&nbsp; A&nbsp;draft purchase order was&nbsp;issued 4 Dec 2009, then signed&nbsp;5 Jan 2010.&nbsp; The J&amp;A received final signature on&nbsp;5 Feb 2010.

<ARCHDATE>03072010
<DESC>USAMMCE has a consulting contract for studies related to the move of USAMMCE out of Pirmasens. The contract was awarded to develop a master plan which detailed the USAMMCE requirements for the customers served, the anticipated space requirements of the new location, the existing conditions of the medical logistics support, the recommended functional alignment, and the recommended moves, upgrades and/or new facilities necessary to support the mission of USAMMCE. 

This latest modification requires continuation of the existing expert consulting effort pending a new consulting contract.   The effort planned under this modification is key and essential to on-going planning efforts in support of the transformation and relocation of USAMMCE.  Recent leadership decisions regarding specific new locations proposed for USAMMCE require further analysis of the locations designated facilities and identification of renovation and upgrade requirements.  A gap in this support will result in USAMMCE not being able to provide renovation and funding requirements in a timely manner.
