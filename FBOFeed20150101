<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective January 1, 2015 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 056 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

All offers containing the affected SINs received prior to refresh will be reviewed and required to be in compliance with current solicitation requirements prior to award.

Current schedule contractors will work with their PCO to ensure changes are captured through the modification process.

__________________________________________

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Please note with this refresh you must complete the mandatory Readiness Assessment free self evaluation, available on the Vendor Support Center website at https://vsc.gsa.gov. From the VSC home page, click on Toolbox in the upper left corner and complete the Research, Analyze, and Decide modules. The Decide module contains a questionnaire that must be completed by an officer of the company (President, VP, CEO, CFO, etc.) and must be submitted with your offer in order to gain consideration.

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation for Schedule 56, effective 1/1/15. The solicitation is available electronically at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCI-F8-03-0056-B (include the dashes). Schedule 56, Buildings and Building Materials/Industrial Services and Supplies, includes the following programs: FSC 39, Warehouse Equipment and Supplies; FSC 46, Air & Water Purification and Sewer Treatment Equipment; FSC 49, Maintenance & Repair Shop Equipment; FSC 54, Pre-Engineered/Prefabricated Buildings and Structures; FSC 54, Above Ground Storage Tanks; FSC 56, Building Materials; FSC 61, Power Distribution Equipment; Generators, & Batteries; FSC 62, Solar Energy Systems & Lighting Products. Schedule 56 actively solicits offers for alternative/renewable energy products and systems, energy efficient products, green products, such as green roof systems, and environmentally friendly products/services. This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. Effective January 17, 2011, products added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Numbers (SINs) 206-4, Energy Saving Lighting, Energy Efficient and/or Environmentally Friendly Lamps (light bulbs) 

Lighting Fixtures and Accessories, Indoor Emergency Lighting, Reading Lights, Lighting Sensor Systems ; 563-25, Plumbing Products and Bathroom Fixtures; 563-28, Industrial and Commercial Electric and Gas Water Heaters, Boiled Water Heaters, including options and accessories, either by new offer or modification must meet the following Government standards. Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/) requires that 95% of all new contracts include products that are energy-efficient (ENERGY STAR qualified or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated). In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated these three SINs on Schedule 56, which will require qualifications where applicable. For SIN 206-4, all light bulbs including fixtures with light bulbs, must meet Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) requirements (where applicable), and be qualified Energy Star or FEMP compliant. Energy Star lighting specifications can be obtained through the website at http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_specs.luminaires. Information on how products earn the ENERGY STAR label can be found at

http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.pr_how_earn. Energy Star is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy helping us all save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices. Product designation process for FEMP can be found at http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/technologies/eep_fempdesignatedproducts.html. For SIN 563-25 all toilets, urinals, bathroom faucets and shower heads must meet WaterSense requirements and be certified as WaterSense compliant by obtaining certification through the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at http://www.epa.gov/Watersense/about_us/watersense_label.html. For SIN 563-28, all gas water heaters must meet either Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) requirements and be certified Energy Star or FEMP compliant. Certification for Energy Star can be obtained through the website at www.energystar.gov.

Product designation process for FEMP can be found at http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/technologies/eep_fempdesignatedproducts.html. The offeror must make an affirmative statement that the products offered are compliant with the applicable standard and the products are listed on the Energy Star, FEMP or EPA website. Dealers using their own part numbers must also list the corresponding manufacturer part number. To determine if you are submitting items that are listed in one of the luminaries specifications for items offered under SIN 206 4 please go to http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_specs.luminaires and review the ENERGY STAR Luminaries V1.0 Final Specification document. The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. The Trade Agreements Act applies to this solicitation. Small Business Set-Aside provisions will be addressed in the individual product/services attachments to the solicitation. Paper offers will no longer be accepted for this schedule. The section at the beginning of the Vendor Response Document providing instructions for submitting a paper offer should be disregarded; Schedule 56 is a mandatory eOffer schedule. For questions regarding submission of offers under Schedule 056, Buildings and Building Materials/Industrial Services and Supplies, Solicitation 7FCI-F8-03-0056-B contact Haley Naegele at 817-850-8444, or via email at haley.naegele@gsa.gov ; or Cheryl Goff at 817-850-8205, or via email at cheryl.goff@gsa.gov.

<DESC>Solicitation No. 7FCM-C4-030073-B
Schedule 73 Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning Equipment and Supplies, Chemicals, and Services

Synopsis:

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION. The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, Texas, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective January 1, 2015 electronically. IMPORTANT: CURRENT SCHEDULE 73 CONTRACTORS DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation for the Core Business Line (CBL) for Schedule 073, Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning Equipment and Supplies, Chemicals, and Services. The solicitation number is 7FCM-C4-03-0073-B, and is effective January 1, 2015. This solicitation includes the following product/services: FSC Group 68: Chemicals and Chemical Products; FSC Group 72: Recycling Collection Containers and Waste Receptacles; FSC Group 73: Food Service Equipment, Supplies, and Services; FSC Group 79: Cleaning Equipment, Accessories, Janitorial Supplies, Cleaning Chemicals, and Sorbents; and FSC Group 85: Toiletries, Personal Care Items, Linens, and Lodging and Hospitality Supplies and Services, and Hospitality Wear. This solicitation is issued electronically only. This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. Effective November 22, 2010, all products added by modification to current contracts or awarded under new contracts for Special Item Numbers (SINs) 302-49, Refrigeration Equipment - including Blast Freezers, Chillers; Commercial Refrigerators; Commercial Freezers; Dairy Cases; Deli Cases; Walk-In Refrigerators; Walk-In Freezers; Ice Dispensers; Ice Making Equipment; Ice Storage Bins and Carts, and SIN 375-361 - Biodegradable Cleaner/Degreaser (Water Based) Non-Phenolic and Non-Petroleum - Products approved by USDA for Food Handling Areas, must meet the following Government standards. Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies. In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated these two SINs on Schedule 73, which will require qualifications. For SIN 302-49, all items, where applicable, must meet Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) requirements (where applicable), and be qualified Energy Star or FEMP compliant. Energy Star lighting specifications can be obtained through the website at http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=new_specs.luminaires. Information on how products earn the ENERGY STAR label can be found at http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.pr_how_earn. Energy Star is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy helping us all save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices. For SIN 375-361 all items must be certified as Biopreferred by obtaining certification from the U. S. Department of Agriculture at www.biopreferred.gov. The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with a $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. The Trade Agreements Act applies to this solicitation. Small Business Set-Aside provisions will be addressed in the individual product/services attachments to the solicitation. The section at the beginning of the Vendor Response Document providing instructions for submitting a paper offer should be disregarded; Schedule 73 is a mandatory eOffer schedule, effective with Refresh 10. Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-C4-03-0073-B (include the dashes). 

To be the Government's leader in acquisition services, the General Services Administration (GSA) sets the highest standards for its acquisition programs.  To that end, GSA has recently awarded eighteen (18) Blanket Purchase Agreements in support of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) for Janitorial and Sanitation Commodities (JanSan).

In an effort to better allocate government resources and to improve our service to our customer base, GSA will temporarily postpone receipt of new offers under Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Schedule 73 for the following JanSan affected SINs: 375-100, 375-103, 375-107, 375-117, 375-125, 375-129, 375-135, 375-139, 375-200, 375-321, 375-323, 375-341, 375-351, 375-352, 375-353, 375-355, 375-356, 375-361, 375-362, 375-363, 375-364, 375-368, 375-371, 375-372, 384-2, 384-4, 384-9, 476-12, 476-13, 507-2, 507-4, 507-8, 658-1, 681-1, 852-1, 852-2 and 852-3 for the next twenty-four (24) months, effective January 16, 2015.  At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program.

Current Schedule 73 contract holders that are successfully performing and are meeting minimum sales criteria will continue to have their options exercised in accordance with I-FSS-163, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen).  There will be no change as it relates to modification requests by existing contractors.  Additionally, current successful contractors may submit a new offer as early as twenty-four (24) months prior to the expiration of their existing contract, regardless if the JanSan affected SINs are currently closed to new offer submission.

Therefore, GSA will be temporarily closing the JanSan affected SINs to new offers as of January 16, 2015. All offers received prior to that date will be reviewed, considered and evaluated for award as appropriate.  Offers not received by the deadline will not be considered and will be returned.  Offers will be considered on the above referenced SINs after the twenty-four (24) month postponement period has ended provided the SINs have been reopened via solicitation refresh.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to reject any offer which is non-compliant with the instructions reflected in SCP-FSS-001, SCP-FSS-002 and/or SCP-FSS-003 as required by the solicitation and/or is not substantially complete at the time of initial offer submission.

For information regarding the solicitation, please contact Haley Naegele at haley.naegele@gsa.gov or 817-850-8444 or Stephen Nieswiadomy at stephen.nieswiadomy@gsa.gov or 817-850-8378.
