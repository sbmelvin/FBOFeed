<DESC>Supreme Allied Commander Transformation Headquarters (HQ SACT) has announced an opportunity for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on the provision of contract support to assist ACT's Individual and Training Branch under the Assistant Chief of Staff, Joint Education, Training and Exercises (ACOS JETE) in the development of immersive learning content, including visualization and lesson development.
<p>HQ SACT is serving as the procurement agency for this project, which was authorized by the Military Budget Committee (MBC).</p>
<p>HQ SACT intends to use the sealed bidding (two envelope) procedure. Partial bidding is not authorized.</p>
<p>The base contract is for 19 August 2011 - 18 Aug 2012 with the possibility of four option years. The estimated annual amount of funding is $100,000 and the estimated cumulative amount of funding is $500,000.</p>
<p>The reference for this project is IFIB-ACT-SACT-11-30 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement should refer to this reference. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>The Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) for this procurement will be NATO UNCLASSIFIED and will be posted on the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.act.nato.int/procurements-rfp-ifib-noi</p>
<p>Potential bidders must have been pre-approved for participation in NATO ICB and must have performed similar contracts within the last three years substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation. Contractor personnel performing services under the contract must be citizens of a NATO nation and have appropriate professional training and experience in a related field.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>ACT under another division has concluded an investigation into using virtual worlds and serious games for NATO use. This study has confirmed that immersive learning using new technology can provide benefits to NATO and partners. ACT now seeks to develop training and education material using this technology.</p>
<p>The contract will be to assist ACOS JETE staff in developing learning materials to support NATO education and training facilities using the product Virtual Battlespace Worlds (VBS Worlds) developed by Bohemia Interactive and Caspian Learning. ACT seeks to continue using the products developed by Bohemia Interactive to ensure the best use of licenses and the reuse of existing assets and skills developed.</p>
<p>The contract will seek to develop simulation to support NATO operations, exercises and training supporting air, land and maritime forces. During the virtual worlds investigation, NEXUS from Engineering and Computer Simulations was used as the platform and considerable content was built. It is expected that this content will be reused in this development. The first phase will start with simulation of maritime operations and will require</p>
<p>- Developing the visual assets to simulate two types of commercial cargo ship interior and exterior in high detail<br />- Developing visual assets to simulate NATO maritime forces (two generic NATO ships) both exterior and interior in high detail<br />- Developing the visual assets to allow course developers to be able to select and use various types of improvised explosive devices or suspicious objects including weapons of mass destruction<br />- Developing the visual assets to allow course developers to be able to select and use various objects typical on a maritime commercial ship to provide suspicious and non-suspicious objects within the scenario<br />- Developing visual assets to allow course developers to be able to select and edit various documentation including passports, ship manifests and typical maritime documentation routinely used in ship boarding operations<br />- Assisting NATO ACT staff in developing storyboards and storyline scripting to support simulation of ship boarding activities using the VBS Worlds application</p>
<p>Follow-on phases may include Counter Improvised Explosive Devices scenarios, security training, NATO familiarization training and other areas of NATO training and education suitable for simulation.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States.<br />U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:<br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments.

<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DEADLINES</p>
<p>Deadline for requesting Declaration of Eligibility: 24 June 2011<br />(Under MBC rules, the contracting agency will continue to accept nominations to the bidders list after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.)</p>

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for a 2011 Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Desert RATSTesting Program with stand-alone evaluation of commercial and military goggle HMDs (HeadMounted Displays).NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Honeywell International, INC, 19019 N 59thAvenue, Glendale, Arizona.Honeywell has previous experience with DRATS test protocols and program requirementsmaking it most qualified as test coordinator.  DRATS HMD field-testing is scheduled forlate August 2011, and dry run testing is scheduled throughout July of 2011.  These dateswill not change since it is a multi-center program that relies on support from manyareas. The use of another vendor as the test coordinator will impact the current scheduleand create a significant risk that could jeopardize the success of HMD testing, jeopardize the GRC project milestones and deliverables, and would result in significantlyhigher costs to the Government.  Honeywell was used in previous DRATS efforts last yearand this effort is a follow-on activity.  Considerable upfront coordination andengineering has already been done to have agreements in place for the usage/loan of bothHDMs.  This includes considerable customization of HMD electronics for compatibility withDRATS information systems.If the Government were to use another vendor, it would require a least a month for thevendor to be brought up to speed on the DRATS interfaces, test objectives, andexpectations, and at least two more weeks for NASA to evaluate the vendors hardware. With the inflexible schedule, the cost of this procurement would be two to three timesmore expensive as a new vendor would be required to put in more hours up-front to try tomake up for lost schedule.  This would slip the schedule at least two weeks and leaveszero time to complete a Draft Test Plan in time for JSC to concur on that test plan andfor NASA GRC to conduct the JSC Dry Run.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the SimplifiedAcquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13.The Sole Source is under the authority of FAR Reference 13.106-1(b)1.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon June 6, 2011.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.   The installation Ombudsman is KirkSeablom. He can be reached via email at kirk.d.seablom@nasa.gov.

Oracle is the only source that can provide the updates because it created the initial software as extensive modifications to off-the-shelf software specifically for use by the IRS, and Oracle creates the propriety program updates that may be provided as part of its support services. The Government intends to solicit and award to only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested parties may provide a written response that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements under this Notice, to be received by the IRS no later than 12:00 P.M.

Any questions should be directed to Margaret Baker, Contract Specialist, in writing, via e-mail:Margaret.Baker@irs.gov. If no written responses are received that clearly demonstrate the ability to meet all requirements or that is more advantageous to the Government to reconsider its acquisition strategy, the IRS will negotiate and award a contract to Oracle America, Inc.

<DESC>Description: Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 5.205(c), this is a pre-solicitation notice for a Full and Open, Competitive, Best Value, Source Selection acquisition to upgrade Air Force Early Warning Radars (EWR) at Clear AFS, Alaska and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to become a part of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Sensor network. MDA intends to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) which will include upgrades to meet joint MDA/USAF performance requirements while maintaining the two missions of missile warning and space surveillance. In addition, the DRFP will also require the offerors to fabricate hardware, develop and implement Site Unique Software Adaptations, install, test, and field Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) software and hardware. The offerors shall accomplish all of this while retaining the legacy EWR radar front-end and commonality of hardware with the previous three UEWR deployments. The upgrades must be accomplished at the Clear and Cape Cod EWRs while the radar continues to execute its operational mission with its existing prime mission equipment. The Contractor shall be required to align contractual activities with the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), MDA, and US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) scheduling, testing, acceptance and certification processes for hardware and software modifications of the EWRs. The Contractor shall be responsible for developing a final design including solutions to UEWR hardware obsolescence issues such as the receiver-exciter and beam steering units, which ensure form, fit and function commonality among all UEWR sites. All redesigned components must meet or exceed the requirements defined in the UEWR Prime Item Development Specification. The contractor shall be responsible for modifying the baseline UEWR software to accommodate any emerging Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) requirements as identified in the RFP as well as adapting the existing UEWR design to accommodate local ionospheric effects. In addition, the UEWRs will be required to incorporate Concurrent Test, Training and Operations capabilities such that UEWR radar operations will continue without interruption while participating in BMDS ground testing or operator training. The Contractor shall produce technical documentation for operations, training and maintenance of the systems in accordance with Air Force policy. Consistent with maintaining a common UEWR configuration, technical documentation must be produced in such a way as to facilitate migration to the other UEWR sites, including delivery in an editable form. The Contractor shall perform internal facility design upgrades and facility modifications, and/or coordinate with other ongoing facilities improvements, while minimizing impact to site operations and maintenance. The contractor shall transport, install and test UEWR hardware and software, and perform in-plant and on-site system tests in coordination with the Ground-based Missile Defense Communications Network (GCN) and AFSPC for the legacy missions. The Government anticipates several simultaneous projects being conducted during the time of the upgrade. The contractor shall coordinate upgrade activities with all Government agencies and other prime contractors to take advantage of possible synergies to minimize cost and schedule impacts and eliminate the potential for rework. The UEWR software build that performs the missile warning, space surveillance and missile defense missions must be operationally accepted by the AFSPC.<br />Background: Three EWRs at Beale Air Force Base (AFB), CA, Royal Air Force (RAF) Fylingdales, United Kingdom, and Thule Air Base (AB), Greenland, have been upgraded to the UEWR configuration. This acquisition will require the upgrades at Clear and Cape Cod be performed such that a common hardware and software configuration among all the UEWRs shall be maintained. A common upgraded UEWR hardware and software configuration is critical to ensure form, fit and function as well as maintaining commonality in operations, maintenance, logistics and training among all UEWR sites. The anticipated Period of Performance (POP) for this effort is five (5) years with provisions for multiple cost reimbursement and fixed price, term and completion contract line items, including Fixed Price Incentive (FPI Firm Target), Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP). MDA intends to issue a DRFP and conduct industry days /site visits to obtain industry feedback on or before August 2011. Issuance of the final RFP is anticipated by November 2011, with award by 4th Qtr FY12. This requirement will be solicited and awarded in accordance with FAR Part 15 for Full and Open competition. At this time, there are no partial or total set-asides available. MDA intends to award to a single offeror on the basis of the best value to the Government, in consideration of both price and non-price factors. This notice is for informational purposes only and is NOT a solicitation of information, request for proposal (RFP), or a commitment by the Government that this MDA contract will definitely be awarded. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this notice. <br />The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors; i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor and/or participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams. Further, the Government does not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award, except as may be necessary to prevent organizational conflicts of interest between this requirement and advisory and assistance contracts.<br />In order to be considered for award, all contractor personnel shall possess and maintain at least a SECRET security clearance, and proposed contractor facilities shall be cleared at the SECRET/TOP SECRET level. Due to National Security considerations, this acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the Prime or Subcontractor level.<br />Interested offerors are encouraged to register at the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at <a href="https://www.fbo/gov/">https://www.fbo/gov/</a> to receive email notifications when information related to this acquisition is updated or documents related to this acquisition are issued and made available for download. As a rule, MDA will not directly send solicitation or amendments directly to Offerors, and it is the interested Offeror's responsibility to periodically check this website for updates. The Government requests that all interested parties ensure they are listed on the "Interested Vendor's List" in FBO, and also provide the name, e-mail address, and phone number for a point of contact(s) within your organization to: <a href="mailto:ClearCompetition@MDA.mil">ClearCompetition@MDA.mil</a>. Interested respondents shall REQUIRE facility clearances of no less than &lsquo;SECRET" for handling of future solicitation documents. <br />Throughout the acquisition phase, the Government will make available technical data and other information through the technical data/Offerors' library. The Offerors' library contains classified and export-controlled data; therefore, access will be restricted to personnel who have been cleared by MDA Contracting and Security Officials. The procedure for receipt and review of requests for library access is to obtain and sign an "Offerors' Library Access Agreement". This form may be obtained by email request to <a href="mailto:ClearCompetition@mda.mil">ClearCompetition@mda.mil</a>. The Offerors' library will be made available at time of release of the Draft RFP. The Government intends to host Industry Days and Site visits to Clear and Cape Cod. A Visit Authorization Request (VAR) for each location will be required to be submitted 14 calendar days prior to the first industry date. There will be a limit of 10 representatives from each prime offeror including their vendor representatives, if required. The instructions for submitting VAR requests may be obtained by sending an email request to <a href="mailto:ClearCompetition@MDA.mil">ClearCompetition@MDA.mil</a>. <br />It has been determined that any resulting solicitation will contain an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) provision entitled "NOTICE REGARDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI) AGREEMENT(S) (FAR 9.5)" which reads as follows:<br />a. Responsibility lies with the prime contract offerors to ensure that both they and their proposed subcontractors are not restricted from participating in this proposed acquisition due to an OCI clause in any Federal Government Contract, including, but not limited to, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) contracts. b. Any offeror who has signed, as well as all proposed subcontractors who have signed, a contract with an OCI agreement, as either a prime contractor or subcontractor under any such contract shall submit a written application to the MDA Directorate of Contracting, Sensors Directorate, via email to Carol Rivard at <a href="mailto:Carol.Rivard@mda.mil">Carol.Rivard@mda.mil</a>, to obtain approval to participate in this acquisition.<br />c. Further, if either the prime, or any of its proposed subcontractors, is currently performing (or in the process of proposing on) an effort that appears to have a potential conflict with the upcoming acquisition, regardless of whether there is an OCI clause or not, the prospective Prime contractor shall submit a written application to the Directorate of Contracting, Sensors Directorate, via email to Carol Rivard at <a href="mailto:Carol.Rivard@mda.mil">Carol.Rivard@mda.mil</a>, to obtain approval to participate in this acquisition.<br />d.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 the business size standard is $12.0 million. <br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.<br /><br />The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is an intramural research program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) that conducts population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. Separate genome-wide association study (GWAS) investigations conducted by investigators from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) were recently combined to identify common genetic variants associated with renal cancer risk. DCEG investigators are seeking to expand the NCI GWAS in order to detect additional susceptibility loci across a wider range of allele frequencies and magnitudes of effect. In addition to identifying novel risk loci, the proposed GWAS will investigate genetic variants associated with renal cancer survival. <br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to identify and select renal cancer cases in the Physicians' Health Study (PHS) and the Women's Health Study (WHS) cohorts, retrieve stored buffy coat and whole blood specimens for selected cases, and extract genomic DNA from these specimens for analysis in the expanded GWAS effort. Data on administrative and demographic characteristics (e.g., year of study enrollment, age at enrollment, sex) and established risk factors for renal cancer (e..g, smoking status, BMI, diagnosed hypertension) will be provided for selected cases.<br /><br />The Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) manages and stores the prospectively collected specimens from the PHS and the WHS. As the BWH is the only research institution that possesses the samples, they are the only institution that can process and ship the samples to the NCI for analysis in the GWAS of renal cancer. It is essential to have careful records and inventory of the specimens. Specimens collected prospectively in the PHS and WHS are used by a large number of investigators for research projects, including previous GWAS investigations conducted by the NCI. Since a large number of additional renal cancer cases and controls are needed to expand the NCI GWAS of renal cancer, it is critical to include specimens and data from the PHS and WHS in this effort. <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisition on or before 11:00 AM EST on June 15, 2011 11:00 a.m. EST. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax) an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisition to the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist at gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC), Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to solicit, on an unrestricted basis, a requirement for Document Management Services in support of the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC), Bethesda, Maryland.

The contractor will be required to maintain the current fleet of 253 copiers (approximately 150 of which contain CAC-enabled e-copy devices), and provide upgrades to new digital multifunction copiers as the agreements on the current fleet expire.
  In addition, the contractor will be required to provide and maintain additional new digital multifunction copiers as the need arises during the ordering period.  The contractor will also be responsible for assisting NNMC with meeting its requirement to install and configure a scanning solution with Integrated (CAC) functionality with Digital Signatures and Encryption on all of the copiers.

FISC will be conducting a MANDATORY industry day for this requirement on Monday, 20 December 2010 at the National Naval Medical Center. In order to be eligible to submit a quote for this requirement, vendors MUST attend the Industry Day on the designated day and time.
  Offerors are expected to review the draft solicitation prior to attending and come prepared with any questions or comments. Offerors are expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable.

As this is not a solicitation, no attendee should view this as an opportunity to exhibit its qualifications or technical merit that distinguish itself from others in attendance. Questions and conversations that appear to steer in this direction will be discouraged. 

Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost incurred for their participation.
 In addition, any information provided to the Government is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. All information discussed and/or provided to the Government will be considered. 

FISC intends to solicit on an unrestricted basis.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Walla Walla District has a requirement for a Performance Oriented Construction Activities (POCA) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple-Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) with capability to award design build construction projects.<BR>  <BR>The purpose of the MATOC is to provide a variety of design and construction services including but not limited to the following:  repair and maintenance of real property, environmental work, incidental services, force protection work, property repair and maintenance, habitat restoration (environmental work), new construction, and renovation.  <BR><BR>Use of the MATOC provides a construction product delivery method that utilizes industry innovation, can accommodate quick and straight-forward projects, as well as some small but complex projects, can help minimize design effort and related overhead expenditures, as well as handle compressed schedules while reducing acquisition-related lead time.  Projects may range from those where the government provides full design (Design-Bid-Build) to those with limited design and functional specifications requiring the contractor to complete the design and construct the project. <BR> <BR>This procurement is an SBA certified HUBZone Small-Business set-aside.  This requirement will be awarded using a Best Value, two-phase design-build process in accordance with FAR 15.101-1 and FAR Subpart 36.3.  <BR><BR>Two solicitations will be issued in sequence consisting of a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) during Phase One and a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Phase Two.  <BR><BR>In Phase One an RFQ will be issued requesting qualification proposals from interested HUBZone firms based on the overall MATOC scope of work.  Not more than the seven (7) most qualified firms will be selected to submit Phase Two proposals based on the following Phase One evaluation criteria:  design-build experience, past performance, and management approach. <BR><BR>No pre-proposal conference/site visit will be conducted during Phase One. <BR> <BR>The Phase One Request for Qualifications will be issued on or about February 22, 2011-not less than 15 days from the date this notice is posted.  <BR><BR>In Phase Two, an RFP will be issued to up to the seven (7) most qualified offeror's selected in Phase One.  The RFP will include the scope of work for the first Task Order, Task Order 0001, to be awarded under this contract(s). <BR>    <BR>Phase One evaluations of qualification proposals will not be utilized in the Phase Two trade-off evaluations and Best Value determinations.  All contract requirements will be detailed in the RFP using the USACE Contract Format consisting of the following sections:  00010- Solicitation/Contract Form, 00100-Schedule/Instruction to Offerors/Evaluation Factors for Award, 00600C-Representations and Certifications, 00700-Contract Clauses, 00800-Special Contract Requirements, 01000-Division 1/General Requirements, and 16999-Division 2-16/Technical Provisions.<BR> <BR>A pre-proposal conference/site visit may be conducted during Phase Two.<BR><BR>Phase Two offerors will have not less than 30 days to provide their proposals.  Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of a technical and price proposal based on the aforementioned Task Order 0001 project. <BR> <BR>Proposals received in response to the Phase Two RFP will be evaluated in accordance with source selection procedures outlined in FAR 15.305.  Up to four (4) MATOC contract awards will be made to the offerors whose total evaluated price and technical proposal provide the best value to the Government.  Only one firm will be awarded the first Task Order (Task Order 0001) as a result of this RFP.<BR>     <BR>It is the Government's intent to award up to four (4) IDIQ contracts to the offeror(s) whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value.  Task Orders will be awarded on a firm-fixed price basis.  The value of each Task Order is expected to primarily be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), $150,000, but the Government reserves the right to issue Task Orders valued up to $500,000.  <BR><BR>MATOC Scope of Work <BR>A.	Performance Period:  One year base period and three twelve-month option periods.<BR>B.	Maximum Contract Value:  The total dollar capacity shared between firms will not exceed $6 million dollars.  The annual aggregate amount is estimated at $1,500,000.  Any unused capacity in one period may be carried over into the subsequent contract period.  <BR>C.	Minimum Guarantee:  The minimum guarantee amount for the entire life of the contract for each IDIQ awardee is $10,000.<BR>D.	Task Order Limitations:  The minimum Task Order value is $2,000 and the maximum Task Order value is limited to $500,000.<BR><BR>General:  Task Orders will primarily address general public works construction and renovation including but not limited to the following:  dams, roads and pavement construction and repair, general environmental work, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete work, environmental remedial work and other presently unforeseeable requirements that may arise.  Projects will generally be design-build, requiring some element of design for various construction types, but may include projects in which the Government provides a full design.  The awarded IDIQ's will not be utilized for AE design only requirements that do not involve constructing the completed design.  Task Orders may be issued for construction work in which no design is required.  Task Order projects may be non-complex performance oriented tasks requiring minimal design, or they may be complex construction Task Orders requiring design development for design-build construction, or a combination thereof.  Task Order Proposal Requests (TOPR) may or may not include traditional plans and specifications or may include sketches and other informational submittals. <BR><BR>"Design-Build" is defined for solicitation purposes as a project in which the contractor is provided less than a full design and is required to complete the design.  This includes participating in design review and total construction of the designed project. <BR><BR>Placement of Task Orders:  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by a USACE Contracting Officer who will issue written Task Orders to the IDIQ awardees.  Prices will be requested and evaluated for each Task Order in accordance with FAR 16.505.  Each individual TOPR will state the evaluation criteria for Task Order award.  Individual Task Order awards may be evaluated on price only or price and other non-cost evaluation factors as outlined in the TOPR.  Whenever possible, award will be made without discussions. <BR><BR>Area of Responsibility:  The MATOC work will primarily be geographically located throughout the Walla Walla District area of operations, principally Washington, and work concentrated at Mc Nary (Washington and Oregon), Ice Harbor, Little Goose, Lower Monumental, Lower Granite, Dworshak (Orofino, Idaho) and Lucky Peak (Boise, Idaho) Dams.  The Walla Walla District's civil works boundaries generally follow the Snake River drainage and include approximately 107,000 square miles in six states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, and small parts of Nevada and Utah.  Work may include additional project locations within the Pacific Northwest covered by USACE Seattle and Portland Districts.  The Government reserves the right to issue additional solicitations and award additional contracts for the same or similar work within the area covered by this MATOC.  This is not a solicitation for a Requirements Contract.  <BR><BR>Task Order 0001:  The Government intends to award Task Order 0001 for the design completion and electrification of the storage building at Ice Harbor Lock and Dam concurrently with the MATOC awards.  The project includes minor construction consisting of electrical design completion and interior electrical construction.  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of this first Task Order is between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00.  This Task Order will be awarded on the basis of price and technical criteria.  The primary NAICS Code for Task Order 0001 is 238210, Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors; with a small business size standard of $14 million.<BR><BR>Award of the first IDIQ and Task Order 0001 will be made to the Offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best overall value to the Government based on the evaluated ratings from the Phase Two proposals. The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer or to reject all offers. The Government will not award a contract to an Offeror whose proposal contains a deficiency, as defined in FAR 15.001. <BR><BR>The Contracting Officer will award the subsequent IDIQ contracts to the Offerors whose proposals are considered to represent the remaining best value to the Government based on the evaluated ratings from Phase Two. <BR><BR>Joint Ventures (JV)<BR>A joint venture is defined as follows:  a legal business entity formed between two or more companies (parties) to undertake the performance activities of a contract together.  This does not include other arrangements such as "teaming agreements" or "strategic alliance", which are not recognized as bona fide joint ventures for the purposes of this solicitation.  <BR><BR>A company that is part of a joint venture must submit a legally binding joint venture agreement.  The Government will not evaluate the capability of any contractors that are not included in the joint venture agreement.  Joint ventures must include a copy of the legal joint venture agreement signed by an authorized officer from each of the firms comprising the joint venture with the chief executive of each entity identified.<BR><BR>If submitting a proposal as a joint venture, the experience, past performance, and management plan of each of the joint venture partners can be submitted for the joint venture entity.  The experience for each joint venture partner will be considered the experience of the joint venture entity.  Page and project form limits apply to the joint venture as a whole.  Prospective Offerors that submit Phase One proposals may not change their firm (including LOC's and proposed sub-contractors) or their Joint Venture firms, if selected to submit Phase Two proposals.  <BR><BR>Credit for Subcontractor Experience; Letter of Commitment (LOC)<BR>If an Offeror wishes to be credited with a subcontractor or supplier, i.e. a firm that is not the prime contractor or part of the joint venture, a letter of commitment signed by the subcontractor and the prime contractor must be submitted.  The commitment letter must be submitted even if the firm is in some way related to a joint venture partner (for example, the subcontractor is subsidiary of a joint venture partner, or a subsidiary of a firm to which the joint venture partner is also a subsidiary).  In regard to Experience, if an Offeror submits projects demonstrating experience in one of the factors, and that project was completed by a subcontractor, a subsidiary, or a supplier, as opposed to the prime or one of the joint venture partners, the Offeror MUST submit a signed letter of commitment from the contractor who performed and completed the work.  If a letter of commitment is not submitted, the experience will not be considered.  Prospective Offerors that submit Phase One proposals may not change their firm (including LOC's and proposed sub-contractors) or their Joint Venture firms, if selected to submit Phase Two proposals.  <BR><BR>NOTE:  The closing date annotated on the pre-solicitation notice via FedBizOpps is for FedBizOpps archiving purpose only.  <BR>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Characteristics</span></strong></p>
<p>Milstar and AEHF are joint service satellite communications systems that provide secure, jam resistant, worldwide communications to meet essential wartime requirements for high priority military users. The multi-satellite constellation links command authorities with a wide variety of resources, including ships, submarines, aircraft and ground stations, providing interoperable encrypted voice, data, teletype or facsimile communications among the users of Army, Navy, and Air Force Milstar terminals, and Army, Navy, and Air Force, and International Partner AEHF terminals. These links are used for a multitude of operations, from calling in Theater Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and air strikes from forward deployed fire teams, to national command and control messaging, through missile defense and Presidential communications links. Immediate execution of these requirements is crucial. Any delay or degradation of service would result in serious loss of military capabilities, assets, intelligence and personnel. Recovery time for tactical and strategic nets would suffer extended outages. These links also face severe cryptographic problems if the personnel on the proposed 4SES contract are unable to deliver Cryptographic Key Allocation Tables. Without this capability, many terminals would be unable to receive the correct crypto keys that will allow access to the satellite. Milstar is the primary survivable communications provider for missile warning networks - these are the highest priority networks for national security. Contractor support must demonstrate a thorough understanding of Milstar and AEHF systems, and the mission of 4 SOPS. The majority of contractor resources will be employed within the Restricted Area at Schriever AFB, at both the Secret and Top Secret/SCI levels. The contractor must have on staff, or have the ability to hire and retain, personnel to perform the work with the required clearances. The core support personnel will be required to work with day-staff on-site primarily at Schriever AFB, Colorado.</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor must possess technical capabilities in the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Expertise and/or the ability to demonstrate technical knowledge of Milstar and AEHF strategic Communications systems to include: <br />a. Establishing terminal image files to be distributed to all Terminal Data Nodes.<br />b. Developing low, medium, and extended data rate resource partitions.<br />c. Identification of correct network configurations. <br />d. Providing analysis for payload table definitions.<br />e. Identifying network inconsistencies.<br />f. Identifying the resources utilized by each user. <br />g. Assisting users in resolving system related issues impacting strategic services.<br />h. Analyzing Milstar and/or AEHF field user communication plans for technical feasibility.<br />i. Providing communications systems proficiency training on technical theory, communications planning, and communications planning tool usage.</p>
<p>2. Expertise and/or the ability to demonstrate technical knowledge of Milstar/AEHF Tactical Planning Services to include:<br />a. Tactical networks submitted through the Satellite Assignment Authorization process.<br />b. MPE data configuration management and installation of subsequent software increments. <br />c. Providing technical assistance to RSSC's and SSC's during their development of contingency or exercise communications plans.<br />d. Providing training of Milstar/AEHF terminal operations.<br />e. Providing daily trending of constellation resources used. <br />f. Managing and providing system administration support to the Milstar Integrated Space Picture (MISP) software tool and the associated operating software on the server. <br />g. Providing technical expertise during Exercises, and Contingency planning/operations to help ensure the most efficient use of the Milstar/AEHF constellation.<br />h. Troubleshooting tactical network and terminal related issues during apportionment transitions and day-to-day operations. <br />3. Expertise and/or ability to demonstrate knowledge of Milstar/AEHF Cryptographic and COMSEC Operations Support Services to include:<br />a. Providing joint cryptographic planning for all users of the Milstar and AEHF systems.<br />b. Managing Key Authorization Tables. <br />c. Processing National Security Agency bulk key orders.<br />d. Providing proficiency training on cryptographic rollover periods. <br />e. Binding, Breaking-the-Chain, and Emergency Rekey.<br />f. Providing communications security planning for KGV-11 services.<br />g. Providing updates to the AEHF Satellite Mission Control Subsystem (ASMCS) Over the Air Rekey (OTAR) tables.<br />4. Expertise and/or ability to demonstrate knowledge of Milstar/AEHF Computerized Communications Planning Tool Services.<br />5. Expertise and/or ability to demonstrate knowledge of Milstar and AEHF System Technical Services to include:<br />a. Reviewing performance parameters such as transmitter power and receiver sensitivity.<br />b. Reviewing and coordinating on documents pertaining to payload operations and mission planning and execution for current and developing SATCOM systems.</p>

<p>12. Description: The Space and Missile Systems Center, Space Development and Test Wing, Launch Test Squadron (LTS), Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM, is contemplating multiple awards of a seven-year delivery order Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a combination of Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Firm Fixed Price, and Fixed Price Incentive Fee delivery orders for missions that encompass a wide range of small launch missions detailed below in Mission Scenarios 1-3. The purpose of this program will be to provide enhanced capability and flexibility in the development of small launch vehicles and launch services using mature vehicle designs and any combination of commercial and Government Furnished Property (GFP) motors to meet a variety of mission and payload requirements. The Government is requesting interested firms to submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) expressing their desire and ability to meet the Small Launch Vehicle objectives to this office.<br />Background: LTS is looking for launch service providers and, while the launch vehicle itself is an important part of the requirement, the ability to modify a vehicle with the addition of stages, greater volume fairing, alternate launch locations, reduced launch call up times, and other mission-enabling capabilities are equally important. LTS requires a multitude of small launch capabilities to support the following mission types:<br />Mission 1 - Small Satellite: Mission 1 covers small spacecraft/satellites that range from 500 lbs to 6,000 lbs in mass to a Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Additional orbits of interest include, but are not limited to, higher energy orbits such as Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEO). Potential missions will include single satellite insertions as well as multiple payloads. Responses should include discussion on the company's capability to support multiple payload deployments. Mission timelines will be from 3+ years to 12 months for nominal missions. The contract will have provisions to support operationally responsive space missions.<br />Mission 2 - Sub-Orbital Launch: LTS supports government agencies with sub-orbital missions that may either be simply the booster itself, re-entry vehicles, or experiments. This mission type may be either air or ground launched, liquid or solid, and may require launch from austere locations. Target missions will be sub-orbital in nature.<br />Mission 3 - Test Launch: LTS supports a number of launches that are neither targets nor space launch. These missions may be to demonstrate new technologies, unique items, and other unique R&amp;D activities. It is difficult to define the capabilities needed for these launches prior to an experimental or R&amp;D mission being defined. The interested firm should discuss their ability to develop a launch system, either from a modified configuration or from the ground up, based on the mission requirements. Prospective firms need to discuss their ability and knowledge of launching from any launch range and the ability to meet range safety requirements.</p>
<p>For each mission type the contractor will be required to develop the launch vehicle, including, but not limited to, development of guidance and control systems, mission and targeting software, flight termination systems, providing the launch service, and performing post-launch analysis. The contractor will develop, procure, and build flight hardware, and integrate and launch the mission from any of several ranges.</p>
<p>The contract ordering period will be for seven years and will require flexibility in responding to unique technical requirements, vehicle quantity, and schedule changes. Depending on the mission, the government may provide the following GFP: payload, launch facilities, solid booster motors (deactivated Minuteman and Peacekeeper ICBM rocket motors), payload isolation systems, separation systems, re-entry vehicles, decoys, and launch vehicle transportation hardware. The Statements of Capability shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing these areas: (A) Experience: an outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed, and any in-house research and development effort relevant to the specific task areas of this effort, (B) Personnel: professional qualifications and specific experience of scientific, engineering and program management personnel who might be assigned to work in areas of the subject effort, and (C) Facilities: availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration, and a statement regarding industrial security clearance and storage facilities to support work at the SECRET level.</p>
<p>The responses provided for Experience, Personnel, and Facilities above should contain information demonstrating the ability to meet the following technical requirements for each of the three specific mission types the contractor is interested in pursuing. The technical requirements are:<br />(1) Mission Design: Ability to design launch vehicle(s) using commercial and GFP motors meeting all technical, mission, and safety requirements. This includes the ability to (a) design launch vehicle(s) that are either flight proven, derived from a flight proven design(s) or, for new configurations, maximize the use of flight heritage components and systems and other efforts that minimizes mission risk; (b) incorporate different test range ground and flight safety requirements into the design of the launch vehicle systems; (c) integrate a payload (designed and provided by an independent contractor or as GFP) to the launch vehicle; and (d) design, develop, and test the vehicle to include guidance and control hardware and software and attitude control systems capable of meeting mission requirements.<br />(2) Mission Planning: Ability to perform a range of mission planning, targeting, and data analysis efforts. This includes the ability to (a) provide mission planning and targeting of the proposed launch vehicle(s); (b) coordinate mission parameters with outside agencies by providing trajectory data and vehicle characterization; (c) perform post-mission analysis of booster telemetry and ground sensor data.<br />(3) Launch Vehicle Fabrication and Test: Ability to fabricate and test the necessary components, and assemble the launch vehicle. This includes the ability to (a) manufacture and test attitude control hardware capable of performing required maneuvers; (b) fabricate, modify, integrate, and test guidance and control systems; (c) provide facilities, tooling, support and test equipment for both hardware and software, which the contractor will maintain and utilize for testing, manufacturing, integration and analysis; (d) test hardware for vibration, shock, humidity and temperature for both individual components and integrated systems; (e) provide facilities to safely test individual components and integrated systems; (f) safely transport hardware, including motors and pyrotechnic devices; (g) obtain access to a manufacturing and testing facility with facility clearance at the SECRET/ NOFORN level.<br />(4) Launch Vehicle Assembly and Test: Ability to plan and perform flight test operations from any government or commercially owned launch range to include air launch capability. This includes: (a) planning launches from the range in accordance with relevant ground and flight safety requirements and mission requirements; (b) integrating and servicing boosters and payload using existing or contractor furnished storage, missile assembly and integration and operations facilities.<br />(5) Program Management: Ability to provide program management activities, integrating systems engineering and other activities. This includes: (a) interfacing with payload contractors, government agencies, and range safety offices; (b) efficiently integrating systems engineering disciplines such as configuration management, reliability, quality assurance, safety, manufacturing, etc; (c) facilities and procedures for hosting SECRET / NOFORN meetings.</p>

The purpose of this notice is to determine if there is enough competition to set aside (complete of partial) to small business concerns or for any eligible socio-economic category.  Potential offerors must be able to employ advanced technological methods in the integration of healthcare data to improve patient quality of care, reduction of medical errors, and increase in cost savings as part of their solution.  A critical component of this project is the substantial interface requirement between the Clinical Information System (CIS) and the VHA hospital information system, VistA.  An essential requirement is the establishment, implementation and continuity of a unified data solution throughout the VISN.  In these terms, data definitions, data comparisons, clinical usage is expected to be seamlessly consistent across all VISN sites.   The AIMS shall allow for future expansion due to the anticipated and changing needs in VISN 6.  The system shall allow for the addition of future CISs such as the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) CIS, enabling them to seamlessly pass data to one another to create contiguous electronic perioperative-critical care information system. Under any resulting contract, the Contractor shall be responsible to upgrade/update the AIMS on an on-going basis to remain compatible with all applications used throughout the VISN as they are also upgraded and improved.     Interested parties are encouraged to submit product information and specifications to Jeff Benton, Contracting Officer, VISN 6 Network Contracting Activity, Department of Veterans Affairs, 241-B Freedom Way Drive, Midway Park, NC 28544 not later than 4:00pm local on June 6, 2011.

<DESC>Sources Sought:
The Naval Acquisition Career Center and the Naval Inventory Control Point is seeking sources with capability for progressive leadership training using a commercial off the shelf (COTS) solution.  This training is in support of the Director, Acquisition Career Management (DACM) efforts to foster cooperation and information sharing by providing opportunities to understand and experience first-hand the issues and challenges facing leaders of a world-class highly complex government-based organization, specifically across the acquisition workforce (AWF) and the broader Navy arena.  This training is designed for those who are, or have the capability of leading high performing organizations and programs today, and have the potential and motivation to take on even more responsible senior leadership positions across the AWF within the next few years.
  

The overall intent is to improve both individual and group performance in the DON AWF arena and to prepare individuals for implementing and maintaining coherent strategies to lead organizational transformation in joint, interagency, multinational and cross-cultural environments.  The NACC is seeking delivery of two progressive, related, quality programs of instruction, addressing two distinct audiences.  The entry level program (Task 1) will provide basic leadership skills and work group techniques and establish a set of common core competencies for entry level and junior members of the AWF.  The journeyman program (Task 2) of instruction will build upon the learning foundation provided in the entry level program and target the more experienced journeyman AWF members and current middle management personnel and provide them with an increased awareness of the responsibilities and skills needed to provide strategic leadership as they relate to transforming and changing organizations.
  This audience will also include supervisors of those AWF members trained in the entry level program, with the objective being continuity in application of leadership principles between employee and supervisor.

<p><br />Notice to Contractor: This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) issued IAW FAR 15.201(e). The provision at FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, is hereby incorporated in this RFI. This RFI cannot be accepted by the United States Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All submissions in response to this RFI become property of the United States Government and will not be returned. No basis for a claim against the government shall arise as a result from a response to this notice. A solicitation may be available in the summer of 2011, therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation at this time.</p>
<p><strong>1. Description:</strong></p>
<p>a. The intent of this Request for Information is to improve the Government's understanding on the current availability of industry service capabilities in the Misawa Air Base area. This RFI is seeking interest from contractors capable and interested in performing Clinical Nursing Support Services at Misawa AB. The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality services at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.</p>
<p>b. Contractors interested in providing information are free to present their capabilities, services offered, employed commercial practices and standards, current and prior completed service contracts, estimated pricing, estimated time between contract award and contract performance desired, and viability of servicing Misawa Air Base. Contractors can also provide feedback on industry limitations that may prevent successful completion of this requirement. Additionally, the Government is seeking information on the most common commercial contract vehicles used for this type of service. Contractors are encouraged to ask questions and or seek clarification on any information provided in this request.</p>
<p>c. The 35th Contracting Squadron, 35th Fighter Wing, Misawa Air Base Japan is considering soliciting offers at some time in the near future for the services listed below. If the solicitation for these services is issued by Misawa Air Base, the requirements in this document may be included. We solicit feedback from prospective service providers on the "art of the possible" with respect to these requirements as well as any other information that may best service our Misawa Air Base customer.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br>Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Live Training System (LTS)<br><br>1.0	Description<br><br>1.1 The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Live Training System (LTS) is interested  in identifying innovative technologies or solutions for the development of a digital visual display for Indirect Fire (IF) weapons, i.e., Mk-19 Automatic Grenade Launcher, M203 Grenade Launcher, and M320 Grenade Launcher.  Purpose of this visual display will allow a soldier to view simulated rounds on a 2D or 3D digital terrain in a Force-on-Force (FoF) live training environment.  The visual display should provide Burst on Target (BOT) visual stimulus and feedback to the soldier so that the soldier will be able to view and engage live targets through Radio Frequency (RF) transmissions. The display will allow a soldier to look across an area to the intended live target while the visual display overlays data passed across a RF network which is synchronized to the soldier's location, orientation, and terrain. Data communication is typically accomplished via Player Units (PU) that interfaces with a RF network. This display should be able to interface via wire or preferably a Personal Area Network (PAN). It is anticipated that the visual display will be appropriate to the soldier's actual field of view in relation with the weapon either mounted on a vehicle platform or dismount on the ground without creating an interference or negative training.<br><br>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the U.S. Army PEO STRI - Business Opportunities Portal website at https://bop.peostri.army.mil/sites/bop/default.aspx.

Verbal questions will NOT be accepted.  <br> <br>Questions & Answers<br><br>1)	Is this a new requirement or is there an incumbent contractor?  <br>There is no incumbent and this is a new requirement.<br><br>2)	If this is a new requirement, is there an estimated dollar value, or NTE value associated with this requirement?  <br>Not at this time.<br><br>3)	Would the Government be interested in (specific types of display)?  <br>We are open to any technologies out there that can meet the requirements indentified in the RFI.<br><br>4)	What TRL level(s) would be acceptable? <br>TRL-7 or higher.<br><br>5)	What training systems should this interface with (e.g. CTIA)? <br>HITS, CTC-IS, OneTESS, IRS.<br><br>6)	Is the Government interested in head-mounted or weapon mounted displays? <br>The Government will look at all options.<br><br>7)	Is this system intended for outdoor training or just indoor; outdoor is strongly implied but not stated? <br>System is for outdoor training.<br><br>8)	Is the Government interested in 6DOF location and pose technologies? <br>We think such is required for this capability. The Government is interested in 6DOF if it meets the requirement and is cost effective.<br><br>9)	Does the Government have an accuracy metric for the 6DOF solution? <br>No, not at this time.<br><br>10)	Will this technology be part of an existing program? <br>Yes. OneTESS.<br><br>11)	The RFI language seems to mostly refer to a visual display from the shooter's perspective (i.e. the trigger man for the indirect fire shot). Is the intent to restrict the solution to the shooter or is there interest in allowing visualization of the effect from any vantage point on the battlefield, including the target? <br>The visual display is for the shooter's perspective.<br><br>12)	What is the meaning of the RF transmissions language in section 1.1? Does that refer to the sending of engagement information over RF (i.e. electronic bullet), or does it refer to the use of comms during training? <br>RF means communications over a network.

<DESC><p>This is a notice of intent to award a Sole Source Procurement. The Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA) intends to negotiate a Fixed Price contract on a sole source basis with Florida State University (FSU). The primary objectives of this effort are to embed a lagrangian transport and dispersion (T&amp;D) model within the Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF). This T&amp;D model should be well-validated and peer-reviewed. This work will also entail determining the optimal configurations for T&amp;D modeling within WRF. The WRF model was developed by various agencies and universities (e.g., the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), and Penn State University) and is considered the United States meteorological community mesoscale model. This research and development will consist of sensitivity studies of T&amp;D using WRF with the newly integrated transport and dispersion model as compared to similar T&amp;D models run offline from the WRF model. The required services call for unique experience in transport and dispersion issues, including experience with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) airborne field projects involving the global transport of air pollutants. Locations of those field projects include numerous regions within both hemispheres. Expert-level experience in performing and analyzing numerical model simulations over various regions of the world is critical to accomplishment of this requirement. This research will answer questions that are very similar to those encountered during the NASA research. The contractor shall prepare a variety of T&amp;D products for each field project using a variety of meteorological model output ranging from global models down to the locally run WRF model and shall assess the quality of trajectories and other T&amp;D parameters by viewing the trajectories and comparing them with in situ data. This requirement is considered noncommercial in nature and any resultant contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR Part 15. The contract period of performance will be 24 months from date of award. The sole source acquisition is justified under FAR 6.302-3. No solicitation documents exist at this time. This acquisition will be conducted on an unrestricted basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712, with a size standard of 500. Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received prior to the closing date of this notice. The RFP will be available on or about 20 June 2011 on this website only. It is the responsibility of the prospective offerors to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS website (http://www.fbo.gov) for the solicitation and amendments. Fax, telephone, written or email requests for this solicitation package will not be honored. (NO HARD COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION AND OR AMENDMENT WILL BE ISSUED FOR ANY REASON). Potential contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award. (See internet site: https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx). It is mandatory to obtain a DUNS number prior to registering in CCR by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505. This synopsis does not constitute an IFB or RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government will not otherwise pay for either the information solicited or any required travel expenses.<br />AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman is applicable. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<CONTACT>Leigh D. Eberhart, Mr., Phone 6123363206, Fax 6123363550, Email Leigh.D.Eberhart@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>The National Plant Germplasm Quarantine Center (NPGQC) in Beltsville, Maryland, is a critical mission APHIS facility that operates 24/7. Two 150-ton ALS170As27 McQuay air-cooled rotary screw chillers were installed during the Phase I and II Planed Expansion construction at NPGQC in 2000. The chillers supply chilled water throughout the facility which is utilized in providing critical temperature controlled environmental conditions for the BSL-3AG High Containment Facility, growth chambers, growth rooms, and diagnostic laboratories. Continual operation of the two McQuay chillers is critical for conducting plant pathogen testing and guaranteeing containment of foreign pathogens. The two chillers are extremely unreliable and undersized. Compressor #2 (one of two per chiller) located in Chiller #2 went into alarm Monday afternoon (Memorial Day) resulting in the chiller shutting down which reduced the facility's chilled water cooling capacity by 50 percent. The Beltsville outdoor temperature was 96 degrees at the time. Facility Management was successful in restarting the first compressor but not the second on Chiller # 2. The internal refrigerant gate plate inside the compressor has disintegrated and damaged the internal rotary screw assembly beyond repair. A reconditioned rotary screw compressor will need to be procured immediately and installed so that NPGQC's production of critical 42 degree F. chilled cooling water can be brought back down to normal temperature levels. The compressor was replaced in 2006 and is past the warranty period. New compressors are no longer manufactured. McQuay Service is the only authorized parts/service company where the compressor can be purchased from. A direct McQuay replacement compressor is required (air-cooled rotary screw compressors are unique and specific for each manufacturer) compressors from other manufacturers, such as Trane, York, or Carrier, are not compatible with our chiller and attempted use would result in operational failure. Any non-McQuay mechanical contractor would have to deal with McQuay International/Services in order to purchase the required compressor. The entire refrigerant loop system will have to be evacuated and examined for debris from the disintegrated gate plate that could interfere with operation once the new compressor is installed. This work needs to be completed at the same time that the compressor is being replaced due to the refrigerant evacuation process.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC), intends to award a contract on a noncompetitive basis to Burns, Cooley, Dennis, Inc-551 Sunnybrook Rd, Ridgeland, MS 39157-1811. This action shall be undertaken in accordance/FAR 13.106-1(b) / Soliciting from a single source.<br><br>The scope of work will include the evaluation of infrared heaters and rejuvenator technologies through  laboratories and field tests to augment the asphalt sustainment kit by adding the capacity for doing repairs using hot-in-place asphalt recycling.  The repairs will be evaluated for rutting and binder PG grade improvement.  The PG grade will give an idea of how the binder properties improve after reheating and rejuvenating it.  Therefore, the original and final binder PG grades must be determined.  For that, the binder needs to be tested to characterize the viscous and elastic behavior at medium to high temperatures through the Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) test (AASHTO 315, ASTM D7175) to determine the high temperature of the PG grade.  Then it is tested using a Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) to determine its ability to resist low temperature cracking, which is used to determine the binder's low temperature PG grade (AASHTO T 313, ATSM D6648).  The results of these two test will give the PG grade of the binder, and they will be conducted before and after the recycling process. <br><br>Requirements for this procurement include:<br>	The laboratory must be certified by the US Army Corps of Engineers for standard asphalt tests through 2012.  The test center must be within 150 miles of ERDC Vicksburg, MS location to enable personnel to complete round trip material delivery and inspection in a single day.  At a minimum, the laboratory must be capable of conducting the following ASTM tests: Extraction of Asphalt Cement D2172, Recovery of Asphalt Cement D5404, Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) D7175, and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) D6648.  Please refer to the following website for validated laboratory listings: http://www.wes.army.mil/SL/MTC/ValidatedLabsList.htm .<br><br>  	The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541712 - Research and Development in Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences.  The small business size determination is 500 employees.<br><br>This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals. Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses to this electronic notice must be made by 4:00 p.m. EST on 03 June 2011. Responses may be submitted by e-mail to MAJ Angela L. Smoot at angela.l.smoot@usace.army.mil .<br>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed fordebarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraudor a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial <br />Page 21of 24 Request for Quotation FA8100-11-Q-0029 <br />challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. section 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer hasbeen issued a notice under I.R.C. section 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course ofthe hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

Further, OPM supports Government program managers in their human resources management responsibilities and provides benefits to employees, retired employees, and their survivors.</p>
<p>As a part of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) continuing effort to promote Federal hiring in areas most adversely affected by current economic conditions, OPM is supporting the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in its effort to assist aerospace workers impacted by the ending of the Space Shuttle program.</p>

Note that the training experience must be held prior to July 30, 2011.</p>
<p>OPM intends to award one Firm-Fixed Price contract to the offeror that represents the best value to the government. The period of performance shall be from date of award through July 30, 2011.</p>

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Solicitation 3QSA-JB-100001-B, Refresh #2, is being issued to update Special Item Number (SIN) descriptions, clauses, and change technical document for bunk beds and loft.

The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous. Resultant contracts will be for five (5) years, with three (3) five (5) year options to your contract, for a total of twenty (20) years if performance is satisfactory. The options are not guaranteed. Some of the measurements of satisfactory performance will be such things as adequate sales, quality performance, and timely IFF payments.  One of the most important evaluative factors will be participation in the GSA Advantage! Program. None of these options will be exercised unless your firm has posted its contract information to the GSA Advantage! Website. All offers received will have 6 months after award of a Federal Supply Schedule contract to submit their electronic catalog to GSA Advantage! website. All contracts will be indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts.  All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions.

Acquisition Timeline:
Vendor Quotes due by: Noon EST, Friday June 3, 2011
 Award issued on or before:  June 3, 2011

The Contract Specialist for this acquisition is Andrew Clarke and I can be reached via e-mail at Andrew.R.Clarke@navy.mil or telephone at (717) 605-3237.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Identification of the Agency and Contracting Activity:

a.	Agency Name:		Center for Executive Education 
				Naval Postgraduate School
				Monterey, CA 93943-5000
								
b.	Contracting Activity:	Department of the Navy
				NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support-Mechanicsburg
				ADP Modernization Contracting Department
				Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788

Nature/Description of the action:

This justification and approval covers the procurement of executive education support services for the Center for Executive Education, Naval Postgraduate School, by Other Than Full and Open Competition from the University of North Carolina  Chapel Hill (UNC).
 This procurement is required to support the delivery of tailored courses for the professional development of the Navys Flag and Senior Executive Service (SES) leadership. The University of North Carolina  Chapel Hill has been a long-time participant in the Navys Executive Education Program (NEEP); and will deliver a focused curriculum of Navy specific coursed emphasizing change leadership, best practices, strategic thinking, and improved business operations.

Description of the supplies/services:

The University of North Carolina  Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill) is a long-time partner in this executive education mission. The Strategic Thinking (ST) course hosted by UNC-Chapel Hill has been particularly effective in supporting the continued professional development and career progression of Navy executives.

The overall objective of ST is for a growing cadre of Flag Officers and members of the Senior Executive Service who can demonstrate on a continuing basis the ability to think strategically, execute the DON/CNO strategy, lead change, and produce more effective and efficient business operations.

Academic experts from the faculty at UNC Chapel Hill are joined by senior executives from both Navy and the private sector to provide participants with a range of perspectives through which course objectives are addressed.
 The EBC brings participants together with Navys most senior leaders for opportunities to discuss policy and strategy issues that impact their commands. Private sector executives share their insights on established and emerging business trends and best practices that may have application in participants organizations.

B. The UNC Department of Navy specific program for the ST will address the multiple, complex factors impacting successful assumption of command or other key position on the Navy. This curriculum focuses on the nature of the leaders role and the skills required to lead a command, organization, or portion thereof, and recognize the potential values of the informal network. The desired outcome is that participants will be provided guidance and time to begin developing an individualized transition plan for their new roles in the Navy.
 



Identification of the statutory authority: 

This acquisition will be conducted under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.

Demonstration of contractors unique qualifications:

UNC-Chapel Hill developed the ST programs to be specifically for the Navy from initial concept in 2007 through mature program delivery in close coordination with the Navy Executive Education Program managers at the Naval Postgraduate School. UNC-Chapel Hill has exclusively delivered this program for almost 3-1/2yrs.

Commerce Business Daily Announcements:
 
The proposed contract award intent notice and justification for other than full and open competition will be posted at the Government-wide Point of Entry.

Determination of fair and reasonable cost:  

The Contracting Officer will determine, in accordance with FAR procedures, that this procurement represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet NPSs needs.
 All applicable procurement regulations have been followed.  An Independent Government Estimate has been provided and the Contract Specialist will use this to determine price reasonableness. In addition, an analysis of pricing information will be performed which will consider commerciality, procurement history, GSA schedules, and other available pricing information in determining that the price is fair and reasonable.  

Description of market survey:  

Market research consisted of internet searches for prominent executive education programs at universities. Subsequently, telephone contact was made with several educational institutions to assess their program content to see if they provided these types of Navy specific courses.
 UNC-Chapel Hill developed Navys ST program and is the exclusive provider of these courses. 

Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:

The requirement for executive development courses for Flag Officers and members of the Senior Executive Service has been met for the past four years by a contractual relationship with UNC- Chapel Hill through General Dynamics-Information Technology. At the direction of OPNAV-N1/Chief of Manpower, Personnel, Training & Education, the relationship with GDIT was cancelled on 31 May 2010 for cost savings and efficiencies.  While a Multi-Award ID/IQ contact was being developed, the remaining courses had been sole source.  However, two courses at UNC-Chapel Hill for FO/SESs remain on the executive education calendar for FY11 and a contract vehicle is needed to accomplish these courses.

 Listing of interested sources: 

N/A

11.
       Actions to remove barriers to competition:

The EBC course requirement may be competed after FY11 Future iterations of the ST course will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

<p>A. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors' initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>B. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Approach - Offeror will be evaluated based upon the demonstrated ability to effectively and efficiently perform the work specified in the statement of work. The approach must demonstrate how each task in the statement of work will be accomplished. This includes information on how the work will be organized and the capability of the offeror. The approach should reflect a clear understanding of the work under this requirement.</p>
<p>2. Personnel- Demonstrated experience, capability and availability of all proposed key personnel, including any consultants or subcontractors.</p>
<p>3. Past Performance: The offeror's demonstrated record, as confirmed by references, of successful past performance of the same or substantially similar contract efforts including quality of services or supplies, timeliness of performance and delivery, cost control and the offeror's business relations.</p>
<p>Sources (i.e. Government databases or other individuals) other than those identified in the offeror's proposal may be contacted/accessed by the Government. The Government may use the additional information received in its evaluation of the offeror's past performance and responsibility determination.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than the cost or price. Although the proposed cost or price is not listed as an evaluation factor, it shall be considered a significant criterion in the overall evaluation of proposals. The factors listed above are in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>C. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>If needed, the Government intends to exercise the option or options under FAR 52.217-8 without further competition or need for justification for other than full or open competition [or limited source justification or sole source justification]. For purposes of evaluation, the potential need to exercise the option under FAR 52.217-8 to extend the period of contract performance for the maximum period of six (6) months beyond the last option period will be considered the same for all offerors. In considering the price of the base period and any option periods, the Government will consider that if the extension of service clause (FAR 52.217-8) is exercised, it will be on the exact same rates and terms, other than length of performance, as the base or option period being extended. The Government will determine whether the price, inclusive of all options (including the options available under FAR 52.217-8), is fair and reasonable, and whether the price of the base period and all option periods (including the option(s) represented by FAR 52.217-8), in combination with the other evaluation factors specified in the solicitation, represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>D. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

(Applies only if the clause at FAR 52.225-5, Trade Agreements, is included in this solicitation.) <br />(i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product, as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Trade Agreements." <br />(ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products. <br />Other End Products:<br />Line Item No. Country of Origin <br />______________ _________________ <br />______________ _________________ <br />______________ _________________ <br />[List as necessary] <br />(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<DESC>TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE - FIRM FIXED PRICE
<p>Background:</p>
<p>AIDS.gov serves to support the policy and programs of HHS Federal programs and their grantee communities. AIDS.gov serves as an information gateway to drive Web traffic to Federal domestic HIV/AIDS information and resources along with the development of new media tools that improve the response to HIV/AIDS. In addition, we report on and monitor key Federal resources and policies that support the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. AIDS.gov and OHAP need a senior researcher who can provide support for HHS' Strategy implementation efforts.</p>
<p>The following pages include:</p>
<p>&bull; Introduction<br />&bull; Qualifications<br />&bull; Scope of Work-Tasks<br />&bull; Past Performance<br />&bull; Delivery Schedule<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br />The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) is the first comprehensive, coordinated national HIV/AIDS plan. The Strategy identifies clear and measurable targets to be achieved by 2015, and requires multiple Federal Departments and agencies to compile detailed annual implementation plans and submit them to the White House and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
<p>OHAP coordinates a variety of activities within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement the NHAS, and also collaborates with other Federal agencies to support the Strategy. The Secretary and the White House have tasked OHAP with a number of Strategy-related communications tasks which must be completed rapidly.</p>
<p>Many of the Federal implementation activities for the Strategy are predicated on all Americans having access to a common baseline of information about the current HIV epidemic. This includes: knowing how HIV is transmitted and prevented; knowing which behaviors place individuals at greatest risk for infection; and understanding the importance of early diagnosis and access to treatment. Equally important is sharing information about the Strategy and how various sectors of society are contributing to the national effort to achieve its goals. As such, the Department and White House are committed to continued transparency in implementing the Strategy and engaging stakeholders and the public in these efforts.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: The period of performance will include a base year (one year) and two one-year options. The deliverables will be the same for all years.</p>
<p>Base Year: July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012 tiny_mce_marker___________________<br />Option I: July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013 $&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;____________________<br />Option II: July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014 $&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;____________________</p>
<p>QUALIFICATIONS<br />AIDS.gov and OHAP need a Senior HIV/Public Health Researcher who has:</p>
<p>1. Knowledge and experience of HIV/AIDS in the United States and its disproportionate impact on certain populations<br />2. Significant knowledge of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, including the Strategy, the accompanying Presidential Memorandum, the Federal Implementation Plan, lead agency operational plans, and the NHAS blog series<br />3. In-depth knowledge of the six lead Federal agencies (the Departments of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, and the Social Security Administration) and their respective NHAS operational plans<br />4. Understanding of the roles, function, and members of the Department's NHAS Implementation Group and the HIV/AIDS activities of various HHS operational divisions and staff offices<br />5. Understanding of, and experience working with, the Office of HIV/AIDS Policy<br />6. Familiarity with purpose, audiences, and components of AIDS.gov and with HHS Web policies and procedures<br />7. Understanding of the Affordable Care Act and how it affects HIV prevention, care, and treatment<br />8. At least five (5) years of experience working on HIV/AIDS issues at a senior level<br />9. At least five (5) years of experience in public health communications activities across multiple Federal agencies dealing with diverse constituencies (e.g., public health leaders, national networks, local community-based organizations) and using a variety of communications channels, including fact sheets, blog posts, websites, and videos/podcasts.<br />10. Masters degree<br />11. Ability to attend at least 3 meetings per month in Washington, DC</p>

Full insurance coverage in accordance with the United States' Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act., 4.

The insurance certificate must provide the name of the US Coast Guard vessel and the contract and/or solicitation number as specifically insured.<br /><br />GROWTH WORK<br />(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.<br />(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.<br />(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.<br />COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: -The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.<br />(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing<br />(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.<br />(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.<br />CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY --No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.<br />CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT -The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor and Availability Program Manager. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.<br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation. Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />United States Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0203<br />Washington, DC 20593-0001<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3695<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>
<p>Potential quoters should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: Solicitation number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date. Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) Rating: DO A3.</p>

<p>EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received no later than <br />10 JUN 11:00 A.M. Local California time.

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

General Instructions</strong>
<p>1.0 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-48. <br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a requirement for Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop managed services. This requirement is solicited as a Full and Open Competition and competed solely through the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov). The associated contract clauses and statement of work are included with this synopsis/solicitation are provided with this solicitation. <br /><br />All vendors interested in submitting a proposal for consideration should do so, prior to the solicitation closing date, in the form of an email to the point of contact listed in this solicitation. All submissions should be in accordance with the stipulations set forth below: <br /><br />1.1 The proposal shall be clear and concise and include sufficient detail for effective evaluation. The Offeror should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements. The Offeror should assume the Government has no prior knowledge of its capabilities and experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's proposal.<br /><br />1.2 Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed artwork, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired. <br /><br />1.3 The proposal packages must be received on the date and time specified in Block 8 on Page 1 of this RFP. Submissions should not contain attachments greater then 5MB in size. Such submissions may be excluded. <strong>Proposals shall be submitted to Scott Stallsmith at scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than June 6, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time.<br /></strong><br />1.4 Proposals submitted after the time and date specified for receipt of the RFP will be considered LATE in accordance with FAR 52.215-1 (JAN 2004), Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition. <br /><br />1.5 Written requests for clarification may be sent to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at the title of the e-mail must include "URHD QUESTION". The content of a question may be included in a notification or answer to all Offerors, but if so included will not divulge the source of the question. All questions and answers will be posted on the FedBizOpps website prior to the closing date of the RFP. <strong>All questions need to be submitted to scott.l.stallsmith@nga.mil no later than June 1, 2011 5:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time. <br /></strong><br />1.6 Small Business Subcontracting Plan<br />Each Large Business Offeror shall provide a Small Business Subcontracting Plan that contains all the elements required by FAR 52.219-9 Alt III (July 2010). This plan shall be submitted separately from the Small Business Participation Approach information required below, which applies to both large and small businesses. An approved Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not a requirement for evaluation in source selection, but rather a requirement for award to a large business and will be incorporated into any resultant contract.<br /><br />1.7 Proposal shall be based on open market pricing. <br /><br />1.8 The government will make award based on a Best Value Trade-off analysis on the submitted proposals. <br /><br />1.9 All offerors must either be registered on the ORCA website or submit a completed version of the Offeror Representations and Certifications (please see Section 6.0 of this RFP). <br /><br /><strong>1.10 Identify in your proposal any particular security restrictions, deliverables, or any other URHD requirements in the SOW or other associated attachments that would restrict implementation of the Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop here in NGA.<br /></strong><br /><strong>II. General Information</strong></p>
<p>1.0 Prospective offerors are cautioned against contacting other Government personnel in regard to this solicitation prior to award. Prospective Offerors are also cautioned to advise potential subcontractors or teaming contractors of this instruction. If such contact occurs and is found too prejudicial to competing Offerors, the Offeror (including subcontractors or teaming partners) making such contact may be excluded from award consideration. Only responses from the Contracting Officer in writing shall be considered for purposes of this procurement.</p>
<p>The Government will use the data and information gathered in the course of this pilot to determine the feasibility of SaaS, Computing to Go Service Models, and Public/Private Cloud Computing for NGA. If this proof of concept is successful, NGA intends to procure these services agency-wide through a competitive acquisition. As such, pursuant to DFARS 227.7202-1(c)(1), the Service Provider is required to provide deliverables detailing changes to or within the Government's hardware and software systems with Government Purpose Rights, as defined in DFARS Clause 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014. This will enable NGA to provide potential vendors in the follow-on competitive procurement with the information necessary for modifying the Government system to enable these services through any commercial vendor.</p>
<p>If the Service Provider wishes to assert more restrictive rights than Government Purpose Rights in any deliverable or part thereof, it shall do so in accordance with DFARS Clause 252.227-7017. Any Government requests to validate asserted restrictions will be done in accordance with the procedures in DFARS Clause 252.227-7019.</p>
<p><br /><strong>2.0 Special Notice - Special Use of Contractor Support </strong></p>
<p>a. The Government will use MITRE personnel for administrative, technical, and price analysis support during source selection. The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government. Proprietary information submitted in response to this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended (41 U.S.C. 423) (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") as implemented in the FAR. MITRE personnel are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information. Contractor personnel assisting in the proposal evaluation are procurement officials within the meaning of the Act, and will take all necessary action to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of a competing Contractor's proprietary data. Non-Disclosure and Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificates for all contractor support personnel participating in this source selection are on file at the respective contracting activities.</p>
<p><br /><strong>3.0 Restrictions of Briefings </strong></p>
<p>During the period of source selection, which begins with release of this Request for Proposal (RFP) and ends with contract award, briefings by potential Offerors to Government agencies on the subject matter of this RFP are inappropriate. Conducting such a briefing without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer may be justification for eliminating your company from further consideration under this RFP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ITEMS and ITEMS - Pilots Background Information<br /></span><br /></strong>NGA is a Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Support Agency that provides Geospatial-Intelligence to both the DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC). NGA provides timely, relevant, and accurate Geospatial-Intelligence in support of National Security. The Director of NGA is the functional manager for the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG), which is the combination of people, technology, policies, capabilities, doctrine, activities and community necessary to produce Geospatial-Intelligence (GEOINT) in an integrated multi-intelligence environment to support National Security Strategy objectives.</p>
<p>NGA is looking to change how the agency procures and provisions Information Technology in order to meet expanding mission requirements given budgetary constraints. NGA plans on implementing a managed services model that decreases complexity, increases agility, enhances reliability, while improving efficiency and effectiveness of IT delivery in support of the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSG). NGA intends to implement these services under the consolidated Information Technology Enterprise Managed Services (ITEMS) program. In order to position the agency for successful implementation of this program, NGA is currently executing risk reduction activities and intends to award several pilots as part of these activities. The purpose of the pilot activities is to explore commercially available technologies for application in NGA facilities as well as external sites. The four pilots being contemplated are Unclassified Remote Hosted Desktop (URHD) pilot, Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot, User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot, and Deployed Services (DS) pilot.</p>
<p>The URHD pilot will explore the use of a commercial Cloud as an alternative to in-house solutions. The outcome of this pilot is to determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity at a commodity price; free up one-third of data center floor space for other uses; flatten recapitalization spikes; provide efficiencies that will free up other IT resources for repurposing toward mission; and provide 24 x 7 access to voice, email, data and cloud applications via Personal Information Technology Devices (PITDs), Smart Phones, etc. NGA expects that the pilot will drive out policy concerns and solutions.</p>
<p>The Managed Data Center Services (MDCS) pilot will explore a flexible, on-demand alternative to standard government owned data centers. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: flexible managed service capacity to provide parallel operations that allows thin client transition; parallel dissemination operations; on-demand flexible capacity to allow rapid provisioning of it services; and benefit from the elimination of expensive facility modifications in limited data center space.</p>
<p>The User-Facing Capability (UFC) pilot will explore flexible, on-demand alternatives to government owned user-facing hardware. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: eliminate need for multiple thin-clients at the desktop; modern, flexible, user-facing hardware; replacement or augmentation of voice and video services; and implementation of mobile thin-client devices.</p>
<p>The Deployed Services (DS) pilot will explore flexible, cross-security domain collaboration capabilities. The objective of this pilot will determine if the following benefits are achievable: deployed personnel collaboration capability for use by deployed personnel in crisis; CONUS and OCONUS situations; and a deployed PITD capability, regardless of whether an existing cell phone network exists.</p>
<p>These four pilots form an integrated architecture that mirrors the ITEMS operational objective architecture, albeit at a reduced capability and scope. By demonstrating this reduced architecture, NGA will gain high confidence in the feasibility of implementing the ITEMS approach, and detailed knowledge of how to structure the enterprise ITEMS acquisition.</p>

<DESC><br />The purpose of this amendment is to answer technical questions and revise the closing date and time for receipt of quotes.<br />Accordingly:<br />1. The hour and date for receipt of quotations is hereby extended to Monday, June 6, 2011, 14:30 EST.<br />2. All other terms and conditions as previously established remain the same.
<p>The technical questions and responses are as follows:</p>
<p>1) Question - In regard to the Subject Solicitation for 16 samples each for toxicity testing with Fathead Minnow and Ceriodaphnia dubia; the methods do not specify if testing should be with 100% effluent and a control or if there will be dilutions, i.e. 100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5% and 6%, as is typical for many NPDES permits for instance. The difference is with 100% and a control there are two tests and with the dilutions there are 6 tests which need to be run. Please advise.</p>
<p>Response - Two different sets of dilutions for the chronic tests are as follows (a total of 8 sites, see table below),<br />a. One effluent sample site: Control, 25, 35, 50, 71, and 100% <br />b. Remaining seven sample ambient stream sites: Control and 100%.<br />We would like to use the results to support an existing permit and be able to calculate an acute result from the chronic test observations. This will require daily observation and daily documentation/reporting instead of just the cumulative reporting. <br /><br />Samples will be delivered 3 times for the high flow (total of six 1-gallon containers for each station) and 3 times (total of six 1-gallon containers for each station) for the low flow per the R3-QA1509.2 and R3-QA15010.2 documents.<br />The total samples shipped for high or for low flow and dilution concentrations are summarized in the table below.</p>
<p>Station Sample containers<br />Day -1 Sample containers<br />Day 2 Sample containers<br />Day 4 Total Samples<br />4ASRE033.19* 2 2 2 6<br />4ASRE031.00* 2 2 2 6<br />4ASRE024.30* 2 2 2 6<br />4ASRE022.90* 2 2 2 6<br />WWTP Effluent** 2 2 2 6<br />4ASRE022.30* 2 2 2 6<br />4ASRE019.00* 2 2 2 6<br />4ASRE015.43* 2 2 2 6<br />Totals 16 16 16 54<br />*Instream Ambient samples. Only 100% ambient water and control water used in tests.<br />**Dilution concentrations of 100, 71, 50, 35, and 25%.<br />Smaller sample volume may be shipped if possible for day 1 and 2, if <br />details meet method QA/QC requirements, especially for non-effluent <br />samples needing less volume (will be coordinated with laboratory). <br /><br />Note: The two sampling events will correspond to 1. a storm event sampling period and 2. base flow during benthic monitoring period (next fall). The high flow sample will likely be taken in July (our wettest month) to correspond to a significant storm event and involves coordination with the laboratory and about one week or more notice.</p>
<p>2) Question - Are dilutions (e.g. 100, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25%) of the ambient samples to be tested, or is 100% concentration only to be tested?</p>
<p>Response - See response above.</p>
<p>3) Question - Will the samples be delivered in two batches of 8 samples (i.e. 8 stations at low flow and 8 stations at high flow)?<br /><br />Response - Samples will be collected from eight (8) sites. One batch of high-flow samples and one batch of low-flow samples will be sent at different times. The two sampling events will correspond to 1. a storm event sampling period and 2. base flow during benthic monitoring period (next fall). The high flow sample will likely be taken in July (our wettest month) to correspond to a significant storm event and involves coordination with the laboratory and about one week or more notice.</p>

<DESC>TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE - FIRM FIXED PRICE
<p>Background:</p>
<p>AIDS.gov serves to support the policy and programs of HHS Federal programs and their grantee communities. AIDS.gov serves as an information gateway to drive Web traffic to Federal domestic HIV/AIDS information and resources along with the development of new media tools that improve the response to HIV/AIDS. In addition, we report on and monitor key Federal resources and policies that support the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. AIDS.gov and OHAP need a senior researcher who can provide support for HHS' Strategy implementation efforts.</p>
<p>The following pages include:</p>
<p>&bull; Introduction<br />&bull; Qualifications<br />&bull; Scope of Work-Tasks<br />&bull; Past Performance<br />&bull; Delivery Schedule<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br />The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) is the first comprehensive, coordinated national HIV/AIDS plan. The Strategy identifies clear and measurable targets to be achieved by 2015, and requires multiple Federal Departments and agencies to compile detailed annual implementation plans and submit them to the White House and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
<p>OHAP coordinates a variety of activities within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement the NHAS, and also collaborates with other Federal agencies to support the Strategy. The Secretary and the White House have tasked OHAP with a number of Strategy-related communications tasks which must be completed rapidly.</p>
<p>Many of the Federal implementation activities for the Strategy are predicated on all Americans having access to a common baseline of information about the current HIV epidemic. This includes: knowing how HIV is transmitted and prevented; knowing which behaviors place individuals at greatest risk for infection; and understanding the importance of early diagnosis and access to treatment. Equally important is sharing information about the Strategy and how various sectors of society are contributing to the national effort to achieve its goals. As such, the Department and White House are committed to continued transparency in implementing the Strategy and engaging stakeholders and the public in these efforts.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: The period of performance will include a base year (one year) and two one-year options. The deliverables will be the same for all years.</p>
<p>Base Year: July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012 $___________________<br />Option I: July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013 $____________________<br />Option II: July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014 $____________________</p>
<p>QUALIFICATIONS<br />AIDS.gov and OHAP need a Senior HIV/Public Health Researcher who has:</p>
<p>1. Knowledge and experience of HIV/AIDS in the United States and its disproportionate impact on certain populations<br />2. Significant knowledge of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, including the Strategy, the accompanying Presidential Memorandum, the Federal Implementation Plan, lead agency operational plans, and the NHAS blog series<br />3. In-depth knowledge of the six lead Federal agencies (the Departments of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, and the Social Security Administration) and their respective NHAS operational plans<br />4. Understanding of the roles, function, and members of the Department's NHAS Implementation Group and the HIV/AIDS activities of various HHS operational divisions and staff offices<br />5. Understanding of, and experience working with, the Office of HIV/AIDS Policy<br />6. Familiarity with purpose, audiences, and components of AIDS.gov and with HHS Web policies and procedures<br />7. Understanding of the Affordable Care Act and how it affects HIV prevention, care, and treatment<br />8. At least five (5) years of experience working on HIV/AIDS issues at a senior level<br />9. At least five (5) years of experience in public health communications activities across multiple Federal agencies dealing with diverse constituencies (e.g., public health leaders, national networks, local community-based organizations) and using a variety of communications channels, including fact sheets, blog posts, websites, and videos/podcasts.<br />10. Masters degree<br />11. Ability to attend at least 3 meetings per month in Washington, DC</p>
<p>All respondents will be required to submit writing samples related to the issues outlined in this Scope of Work. Specific requirements will be included in the Instructions to Applicants.</p>
<p>The contractor chosen under this RFQ will be authorized to secure specific expertise necessary to complete the terms of the contract, including senior-level knowledge of HIV epidemiology, public health policy, etc.</p>

We currently have a contract with NAVFAC for similar work. At this time, we want to ensure that since we intend to continue doing construction projects as a general contractor for the USACE that there will be no conflict of interest should we also succeed in being on the A&amp;E IDIQ. We fully understand that USACE would not likely permit a project to be administered as well as performed by the same company. However, we see no conflict of interest if our CM branch is assigned to oversee projects that do not involve our firm as a general contractor on the construction side. Your concurrence on the above is appreciated before we begin work on our response to this presolicitation. <br /></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma">The A-E firm will not perform the construction management on its own construction work.</span></p>

<DESC><strong>THE DUE-DATE FOR RESPONSES TO THIS RFI IS 3 PM, JUNE 10, 2011.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />THIS REPLACES&nbsp;THE ANNOUNCEMENT DATED MAY 19 ENTITLED EPA-RFI-MEETINGS.&nbsp; THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT.&nbsp; THE EARLIER DOCUMENT WAS ERRONEOUSLY DELETED FROM FEDBIZOPPS.&nbsp; THIS POSTING SIMPLY REPLACES THE DOCUMENT.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br /></strong>Conference, Event, and Meeting Support Services
<p><br /><strong>Purpose<br /></strong>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research and gather information from industry on conference, event, and meeting planning and support for EPA offices and regions across the country. The EPA's goal is to establish a strategic approach to acquiring and providing such services.</p>
<p>This RFI is solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract nor do they affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation. The U.S. Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission. The U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>Each year the EPA sponsors hundreds of conferences and events across the country. The majority of these events are in the 250 - 2,000 person range. These events are critical to the successful execution of the Agency's mission and act as a forum for collaborative problem solving as well as conveying essential information to a variety of audiences. Currently services for planning and executing these events are acquired in a variety of ways by individual offices and personnel across the Agency. EPA believes there is a more efficient and cost effective way to acquire these services.</p>
<p>Through this RFI, EPA is seeking input and suggestions from industry about conference, event and meeting planning and support services in order for EPA to make decisions about structuring a strategic acquisition solution for these services.</p>
<p>EPA seeks feedback from industry on the general description below as well as suggestions or other responses to help optimize the way EPA acquires these services. EPA also seeks responses to several specific questions listed after the description below.</p>
<p><strong>General Description <br /></strong>EPA envisions engaging several companies in the conference/event planning industry to help optimize current conference and event preparation and execution in order to minimize costs and maximize efficiency and attendee experience.</p>
<p>Issues and services that EPA envisions contractor(s) handling may include:</p>
<p>&bull; Providing event planning and coordination services<br />&bull; Identifying and securing event facilities, audio-visual support, supplies and equipment <br />&bull; Identifying and securing event speakers<br />&bull; Identifying and securing lodging for participants<br />&bull; Identifying and arranging for appropriate food or refreshments as allowed by federal regulation<br />&bull; Providing program/agenda support <br />&bull; Providing registration and related on-site support<br />&bull; Providing document preparation support <br />&bull; Providing graphic support and photography<br />&bull; Creating and managing an on-line interface for EPA offices to review available options, choose from a variety of services, and perform information exchanges electronically.<br />&bull; Providing on-line participant registration<br />EPA further envisions contracting with companies that understand Federal regulations, protocols and issues affecting Federal conference/event management, including:<br />&bull; Federal travel regulations <br />&bull; The Federal Acquisition Regulation<br />&bull; Green meeting best practices and requirements (e.g., GSA Guidance for Sustainable TDY Policies and Practices www.gsa.gov/graphics/ogp/FTRbulletin10-06.doc, EPA Green Meetings and Conferences http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/octqtr/48cfr1523.703-1.htm, etc.) <br />&bull; Remote meetings<br />&bull; Regulations and policies concerning registration, refreshments and other relevant areas (for example, see Attachments 1 and 2). <br />&bull; Fee-based conferences or similar "no cost" arrangements in accordance with section 5.B of EPA Order #1900-3 (see Attachment 1).<br />Questions for Industry<br />As part of its market research EPA is requesting industry input on the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Please discus the positive and negative aspects of creating a single over-arching contract vs. multiple contract vehicles. Please be advised that we believe that this service lends itself to developing a strategic sourcing acquisition solution.</p>
<p>2. Please discuss the challenges associated with planning and executing conferences/events of a small, medium and large nature.</p>
<p>3. In the conferencing/event planning arena, what are the typical demographics (size standard, socio-economic categories, geographic location and coverage) for companies that perform this type of work?</p>
<p>4. Please discuss the specific issues that would make a solicitation for this work especially desirable -- or undesirable -- to companies considering competing for the work.</p>
<p>5. Please discuss standard industry practices, and your company's best practices, in providing these services.</p>
<p>6. Please discuss any effective performance-based results associated with providing these services of which you might be aware.</p>
<p>7. Please discuss options for maximizing green meeting and events (e..g, ASTM/APEX Green Meetings and Events Standard, Convention Industry Council's Accepted Practices Exchange Panel on Green Meeting and Event Practices, the Green Meeting Industry Council, etc.)</p>
<p>8. Optional: Attached please find a sample EPA event (see Attachment 3). Please provide your ideas on how to plan and execute this sample event.</p>
<p>9. Please provide any other information you think EPA might find useful in competing and acquiring these services.<br />How to Respond</p>
<p>Please provide all responses to this Request for Information no later than June 3, 2011 in electronic or hardcopy format to Ms. De'borah Sissine at:</p>

<a href="mailto:patricia.a.jackson3@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Fort Worth</a>
<DESC>The Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for construction of a Dormitory Complex consisting of Four Dormitories with a Connecting Conference Center at Harpers Ferry West Virginia<br> <br>Range of Magnitude:  $25 - $100 Million. <br> <br>Some of the factors that maybe considered regarding their use are:<br>a.)	The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br>b.)	The complexity of the project.<br>c.)	Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br>d.)	Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br>e.)	The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br>f.)	The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br>g.)	The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br>h.)	Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.<br>PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<br>Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy:<br>a.)	Project Labor Agreement,(PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.<br>b.)	An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decidesthat the use of project labor agreements will:<br>1.)	Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and...<br>2.)	Be consistent with law.<br>Reference Provision: 52.222-23 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreements.<br>In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLA's. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br>a.)	Should PLA's be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the Lackland Air Force Base? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?<br>b.)	Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br>c.)	Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<br>d.)	Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts?<br>e.)	Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade? <br>f.)	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.<br>g.)	Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br>h.)	Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the Lackland Air Force Base area?<br>i.)	Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential offerors and/or subcontractors to meet the Small Business utilization goals?<br>Please provide your comments via email ONLY to: patricia.a.jackson3@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 9 June 2011.  <br>Agency/Contracting Office:  <br>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District<br>ATTN: CESWF-CT (Rm 2A19)<br>819 Taylor Street<br>Fort Worth, Texas  76102-0300<br><br>Place of Performance:<br>Advanced Training Center<br>Harpers Ferry West Virginia <br><br>Point of Contact:<br>Pat Jackson <br>Corps of Engineers<br>Patricia.a.jackson3@usace.army.mil <br>Fort Worth District<br>

<DESC><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Walla Walla District has a requirement for a Performance Oriented Construction Activities (POCA) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple-Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) with capability to award design build construction projects.  <BR><BR>The purpose of the MATOC is to provide a variety of public works design and construction services including but not limited to the following:  repair and maintenance of real property, environmental work, incidental services, force protection work, property repair and maintenance, habitat restoration (environmental work), new construction, and renovation. <BR> <BR>Use of the MATOC provides a construction product delivery method that utilizes industry innovation, can accommodate quick and straight-forward projects, as well as some small but complex projects, can help minimize design effort and related overhead expenditures, as well as handle compressed schedules while reducing acquisition-related lead time.  Projects may range from those where the government provides full design (Design-Bid-Build) to those with limited design and functional specifications requiring the contractor to complete the design and construct the project.  <BR><BR>This procurement is an SBA certified HUBZone Small-Business set-aside.  The primary NAICS code for work under this procurement is 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction) with a small business size standard of $33.5 million.  This requirement will be awarded using a Best Value, two-phase design-build process in accordance with FAR 15.101-1 and FAR Subpart 36.3.  <BR><BR>Two solicitations will be issued in sequence consisting of a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) during Phase One and a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Phase Two.  <BR><BR>In Phase One an RFQ will be issued requesting qualification proposals from interested HUBZone firms based on the overall MATOC scope of work.  Not more than the seven (7) most qualified firms will be selected to submit Phase Two proposals based on the following Phase One evaluation criteria:  design-build experience, past performance, and management approach. <BR><BR>No pre-proposal conference/site visit will be conducted during Phase One.  <BR><BR>The Phase One Request for Qualifications will be issued on or about February 18, 2011-not less than 15 days from the date this notice is posted.  <BR><BR>In Phase Two, an RFP will be issued to up to the seven (7) most qualified offeror's selected in Phase One.  The RFP will include the scope of work for the first Task Order, Task Order 0001, to be awarded under this contract(s).    <BR> <BR>Phase One evaluations of qualification proposals will not be utilized in the Phase Two trade-off evaluations and Best Value determinations.  All contract requirements will be detailed in the RFP using the USACE Contract Format consisting of the following sections:  00010- Solicitation/Contract Form, 00100-Schedule/Instruction to Offerors/Evaluation Factors for Award, 00600C-Representations and Certifications, 00700-Contract Clauses, 00800-Special Contract Requirements, 01000-Division 1/General Requirements, and 16999-Division 2-16/Technical Provisions. <BR><BR>A pre-proposal conference/site visit may be conducted during Phase Two.<BR><BR>Phase Two offerors will have not less than 30 days to provide their proposals.  Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of a technical and price proposal based on the aforementioned Task Order 0001 project. <BR> <BR>Proposals received in response to the Phase Two RFP will be evaluated in accordance with source selection procedures outlined in FAR 15.305.  Up to four (4) MATOC contract awards will be made to the offerors whose total evaluated price and technical proposal provide the best value to the Government.  Only one firm will be awarded the first Task Order (Task Order 0001) as a result of this RFP.   <BR>  <BR>It is the Government's intent to award up to four (4) IDIQ contracts to the offeror(s) whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value.  Task Orders will be awarded on a firm-fixed price basis.  The value of each Task Order is expected to primarily be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), $150,000, but the Government reserves the right to issue Task Orders valued up to $500,000.<BR>  <BR>MATOC Scope of Work <BR>A.	Performance Period:  One year base period and three twelve-month option periods.<BR>B.	Maximum Contract Value:  The total dollar capacity shared between firms will not exceed $6 million dollars.  The annual aggregate amount is estimated at $1,500,000.  Any unused capacity in one period may be carried over into the subsequent contract period.  <BR>C.	Minimum Guarantee:  The minimum guarantee amount for the entire life of the contract for each IDIQ awardee is $10,000.<BR>D.	Task Order Limitations:  The minimum Task Order value is $2,000 and the maximum Task Order value is limited to $500,000.<BR><BR>General:  Task Orders will primarily address general public works construction and renovation including but not limited to the following:  dams, roads and pavement construction and repair, general environmental work, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete work, environmental remedial work and other presently unforeseeable requirements that may arise.  Projects will generally be design-build, requiring some element of design for various construction types, but may include projects in which the Government provides a full design.  The awarded IDIQ's will not be utilized for AE design only requirements that do not involve constructing the completed design.  Task Orders may be issued for construction work in which no design is required.  Task Order projects may be non-complex performance oriented tasks requiring minimal design, or they may be complex construction Task Orders requiring design development for design-build construction, or a combination thereof.  Task Order Proposal Requests (TOPR) may or may not include traditional plans and specifications or may include sketches and other informational submittals. <BR><BR>"Design-Build" is defined for solicitation purposes as a project in which the contractor is provided less than a full design and is required to complete the design.  This includes participating in design review and total construction of the designed project. <BR><BR>Placement of Task Orders:  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by a USACE Contracting Officer who will issue written Task Orders to the IDIQ awardees.  Prices will be requested and evaluated for each Task Order in accordance with FAR 16.505.  Each individual TOPR will state the evaluation criteria for Task Order award.  Individual Task Order awards may be evaluated on price only or price and other non-cost evaluation factors as outlined in the TOPR.  Whenever possible, award will be made without discussions. <BR><BR>Area of Responsibility:  The MATOC work will primarily be geographically located throughout the Walla Walla District area of operations, principally Washington, and work concentrated at Mc Nary (Washington and Oregon), Ice Harbor, Little Goose, Lower Monumental, Lower Granite, Dworshak (Orofino, Idaho) and Lucky Peak (Boise, Idaho) Dams.  The Walla Walla District's civil works boundaries generally follow the Snake River drainage and include approximately 107,000 square miles in six states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, and small parts of Nevada and Utah.  Work may include additional project locations within the Pacific Northwest covered by USACE Seattle and Portland Districts.  The Government reserves the right to issue additional solicitations and award additional contracts for the same or similar work within the area covered by this MATOC.  This is not a solicitation for a Requirements Contract.  <BR><BR>Task Order 0001:  The Government intends to award Task Order 0001 for the design completion and electrification of the storage building at Ice Harbor Lock and Dam concurrently with the MATOC awards.  The project includes minor construction consisting of electrical design completion and interior electrical construction.  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of this first Task Order is between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00.  This Task Order will be awarded on the basis of price and technical criteria. <BR> <BR>Award of the first IDIQ and Task Order 0001 will be made to the Offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best overall value to the Government based on the evaluated ratings from the Phase Two proposals. The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer or to reject all offers. The Government will not award a contract to an Offeror whose proposal contains a deficiency, as defined in FAR 15.001. <BR><BR>The Contracting Officer will award the subsequent IDIQ contracts to the Offerors whose proposals are considered to represent the remaining best value to the Government based on the evaluated ratings from Phase Two. <BR><BR>Joint Ventures (JV)<BR>A joint venture is defined as follows:  a legal business entity formed between two or more companies (parties) to undertake the performance activities of a contract together.  This does not include other arrangements such as "teaming agreements" or "strategic alliance", which are not recognized as bona fide joint ventures for the purposes of this solicitation.  <BR><BR>A company that is part of a joint venture must submit a legally binding joint venture agreement.  The Government will not evaluate the capability of any contractors that are not included in the joint venture agreement.  Joint ventures must include a copy of the legal joint venture agreement signed by an authorized officer from each of the firms comprising the joint venture with the chief executive of each entity identified.<BR><BR>If submitting a proposal as a joint venture, the experience, past performance, and management plan of each of the joint venture partners can be submitted for the joint venture entity.  The experience for each joint venture partner will be considered the experience of the joint venture entity.  Page and project form limits apply to the joint venture as a whole.  Prospective Offerors that submit Phase One proposals may not change their firm (including LOC's and proposed sub-contractors) or their Joint Venture firms, if selected to submit Phase Two proposals.  <BR><BR>Credit for Subcontractor Experience; Letter of Commitment (LOC)<BR>If an Offeror wishes to be credited with a subcontractor or supplier, i.e. a firm that is not the prime contractor or part of the joint venture, a letter of commitment signed by the subcontractor and the prime contractor must be submitted.  The commitment letter must be submitted even if the firm is in some way related to a joint venture partner (for example, the subcontractor is subsidiary of a joint venture partner, or a subsidiary of a firm to which the joint venture partner is also a subsidiary).  In regard to Experience, if an Offeror submits projects demonstrating experience in one of the factors, and that project was completed by a subcontractor, a subsidiary, or a supplier, as opposed to the prime or one of the joint venture partners, the Offeror MUST submit a signed letter of commitment from the contractor who performed and completed the work.  If a letter of commitment is not submitted, the experience will not be considered.  Prospective Offerors that submit Phase One proposals may not change their firm (including LOC's and proposed sub-contractors) or their Joint Venture firms, if selected to submit Phase Two proposals. <BR> <BR>NOTE:  The closing date annotated on the pre-solicitation notice via FedBizOpps is for FedBizOpps archiving purpose only.  <BR>

<AWARDEE>Raytheon Company, 8333 Bryan Dairy Road, Largo, FL 33777-1230 US
<DESC>The MB1 AIU Obsolescence Upgrade&nbsp;Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA)&nbsp;will address the obsolete components to ensure mission capability. The determination to use a cost plus fixed fee contract resulted from substantial obsolescence discovered during procurement of the final Mod Block 1 (MB1) Audio Infrastructure Upgrade (AIU) Kit. Subsequently, an E-4B Equipment Obsolescence Study was initiated to determine appropriate courses of action to overcome component shortfalls. Since the E-4B Platform has never purchased these items or services before, a cost plus fixed fee contract was chosen. Raytheon is the only supplier of multilevel security (MLS) switch with Voice Over IP (VOIP) capabilities to the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN). No other MLS switch is DRSN approved. Due to size, weight, power and cooling restrictions aboard the aircraft, the E-4B requires a DRSN approved MLS to support mission requirements. The DRSN is unique in that its switching systems provide the capability for multilevel secure (MLS) calling and conferencing as well as multilevel precedence and pre-emption (MLPP). Raytheon owns proprietary software technology that is required to meet certain secure communications requirements. Raytheon provides a proprietary Time Divisional Multiple Access (TDMA) Backplane to allow processing at multiple classifications simultaneously, Enhanced Control Console software to configure the Red Switch with preloaded and on-the-fly mission profiles for Secret and Top Secret SCI point-to-point secure communications. As the AIU subcontractor to the Boeing MB1effort, Raytheon designed and produced the Audio Infrastructure Upgrade for the E-4B. This required Raytheon proprietary software to manufacture the AIU equipment, specialized knowledge/training to perform integration of the kit components as well as testing to insure operational viability. At the time of the MB1 installation the Government did not purchase the software data rights as it was not deemed cost effective. The MB1 AIU Obsolescence Upgrade will build upon the legacy AIU architecture with proprietary software and data.

<AWARDEE>NANOSIGHT LTD;ST MARYS HOUSE;SALISBURY;SP2 8PU
<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1. 	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 12, Milwaukee Medical Center.  695-11-3-140-0189. 

2. 	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the purchase of a Nanosight Nanoparticle Characterization System for the VA Medical Center in Milwaukee, WI research department.  This procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with Nanosight. New purchase of equipment, firm fixed price. 

3. 	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: NANOSIGHT LM1O-HSBF Nanoparticle Characterization System has the ability to visualize nanoparticles and viruses of the size of 1 0-1 00 nanometers.  The Nanosight equipment is unique in that it can size and count nanoparticles.  The optics of the system has a long working distance 20X objective that is precisely matched with the viewing unit. The Nanosight has an integrated blue laser (405 nm) which allows for antibody coating of particles to determine the protein makeup of the particles. The instrument can accurately size and track the Brownian motion of nanoparticles in liquid suspension on a particle-by-particle basis. This instrument uses Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) instead of dynamic light scattering (DLS).The Nanosight can: Visualize particles less than 100 nanometers, track particles less than 100 nanometers, count particles less than 100 nanometers, size particles from '10-100 nanometers,  distinguish particles that are stained with fluorescent dyes that are 10-100 nanometers in size, be able to enumerate a polydispersed sample,  and provide concentration information of particles 10-100 nanometers in size.
 
4.	 Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)).

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): lf the VA did not obtain this particular product the VA would not be able count and size the particles found in osteoarthritis. There is no other product that will allow the VA to perform this task.  

There is no other approach that can accomplish the enumeration and sizing of small particles
in osteoarthritis. We have tried using Flow cytometry but the size of the particles is well below
the detection limits of flow cytometry machines. Other enzymatic ways of characterizing these
particles is very inaccurate.

Accordingly, Nanosight is the only firm capable of providing the supplies described in Section III above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.

6. 	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: The end-users conducted market research and have collected quotes and have evaluated the equipment and its capabilities.  Other competitors were determined  not to meet the VA's specific needs. One competitor could not meet the VA's needs and could not detect particles smaller that 250 nm. 

	Contracting Officer will post an intent to sole source on FBO. 

7. 	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  In accordance with the other quotes, for similar equipment, the end users collected, the anticipated cost of this equipment is determined to be fair and reasonable. 

8. 	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons 
Market Research Was Not Conducted: End users and Contracting Officer both conducted extensive research. Contracting Officer searched VetBiz and revealed zero Veteran Owned Small Businesses using the 334516 NAICS code along with keywords "nanoparticle" and "Optical Microscope"  A search of CCR's Dynamic Small Business Search revealed no small buisnesses, using the same keywords.   

Research department collected three quotes in addition to Nanosight. All three competitors did not meet the VA's needs. The competitors equipment could size the nanoparticles but could not also count. Nanosights equipment can do both. 

Through the market research it was verified that not only is there not an alternate sources, but also on alternate equipment or substitutes would not  fill the government needs with only minor modification. No other qualified sources exist.

In accordance with FAR Part 10, market research was conducted and the VA will post a synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition, and soliciting inquiries from interested parties. 

9. 	Any Other Facts: The treatment of osteoarlhritis in the veteran population is increasing annually as the veteran population continues to age.  Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis in adults and
affects 40 million Americans.  lt is currently untreatable, and often results in significant loss of
independence and increased medical costs for affected people. Risk factors for OA, including advanced age, prior trauma, and obesity are particularly prevalent in the US veteran population and OA is a leading source of disability in veterans.  This proposal deals with the role of small extracellular vesicles, called articular cartilage vesicles (ACVs) in OA.  ACVs carry RNA and protein that can be transferred to chondrocytes. Transfer of ACV contents to chondrocytes mimics changes seen in OA. Understanding the role of ACVs in cartilage and ultimately manipulating the contents of ACVs could lead to novel therapies for OA.  This particular instrument will greatly aid in our understanding of these small vesicles in osteoarthritis and the role that they play in the progression of the disease.  Once we understand the type, size and numbers of these small particles in osteoarthritis, new treatments can be investigated. We have never been able to clearly enumerate the number of particles because of the lack of technology to be able to count them.  This valuable information about number and sizes of ACVs cannot currently be accomplished with other tools

10. 	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: See Section VI above.

11. 	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to
Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: This procurement is being funded by a Grant for this research. Regardless, Research Department still conducted market research to see what was available. All competitors were determined to not meet the VA's needs. 

Again, in accordance with FAR Part 10, market research was conducted and the VA will post a synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition, and soliciting inquiries from interested parties. 



12. Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Restricting Competition

					
1.	Contracting Activity: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Contracting officer VISN20
Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VAMC, 77 Wainwright Dr., Walla Walla, Washington 99362 
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: for PR # 687-11-2-020-0156.     
This procurement is for Reference Laboratory Services from Interpath Laboratory in accordance with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2. 

	a. This is a six (6) month, "Emergency-Stop Gap" contract, and includes the option to extend   
    services IAW FAR 52.217-8 up to an additional six (6) months. This emergency contract will 
    provide critical services during the solicitation and award process for the long term contract.      

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: The contract shall furnish all reference laboratory tests services and Laboratory testing at the rates specified in the billing agreement and transport (courier) of VA specimens from the Community Based Outpatient Clinic locations to the Core Lab in Walla Walla WA. Contractor shall provide courier services of VA laboratory specimens from the Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) (presently in Yakima Washington, Richland Washington, La Grande Oregon, Lewiston and Grangeville Idaho.  Enterprise, Oregon and Boardman, Oregon to be added in 2011) associated with the Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VAMC to the Walla Walla Washington laboratory site at least daily Monday through Friday except Federal Holidays and by request of the Walla Walla Core Lab or the CBOC for training days, all other changes must be through the Walla Walla Core Lab Manager.  Couriers shall provide services according to IATA transportation regulations. Specimens shall be transported according to Time and Temperature requirements (Room Temperature, Refrigerated and Frozen).  Additional courier services may be added or subtracted as additional CBOC's are added or removed.
.
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition: The statutory authority allowing use of other than full and open competition for this requirement is FAR 13.106-1 and FAR 13.5 and specifically 13.501 under Simplified Acquisition Procedures Commercial Items Test Program, as is commensurate with the counterpart FAR Part 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source, and FAR Part 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency. This action is required due to urgent need to keep these vital service requirements met, since the most recent contract expired on March 31, 2011.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): Interpath Laboratory is the only vendor that services all the sites in our very rural catchment area. Interpath Lab is the only Reference lab that combines courier services and will drop the VA lab specimens at the WW core lab from the Community Clinics. The additional of this service reduces overall cost to the VA by not have an additional courier contract and provides for faster turnaround time for results to our providers.   

6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104: The following Vendors, Reference labs were researched Pathology Regional Lab (Lewiston), Quest/Specialty (Seattle), and Pathology Associates Medical Laboratory (PAML). None of the labs had service at all sites in our catchment area. Interpath was found to be the only Reference Lab to provide the additional courier services.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3: In accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii)(iii), the anticipated price to the government is $156,000.00 and is determined fair and reasonable based on the comparison to historical costs (PO# 687-C15057) for the most recent services provided by the vendor, which are the same as their FY 2009 pricing.  It is determined that the pricing submitted by Interpath Lab represents the best interest of the Government.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10): See #5.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition: See #2 (a).

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: None

11. Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to   
      Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:   
      The anticipated date for the posting of the solicitation for the long term contract is, 1 October 2011; 
      and the anticipated date of award is 1 November 2011.
